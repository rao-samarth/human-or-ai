Include complex structures that would have been untypical in an ordinary detective story context at the turn of last century. - Use "I" consistently throughout. - End on I without a final stop sign. Extra guidance for more advanced users: - A good paragraph will contain three significant elements which may each relate thematically through implication rather than directly naming aspects such as jealousy or envy. - Emphasize how themes could emerge subtly within conversation without ever being spoken out loud among friends who already know one another very well anyway thanks to past experiences together. * For instance someone might allude briefly towards some perceived shortcomings during their journey so far whilst simultaneously drawing attention away from recent triumphs over rivals; highlighting instead earlier moments where mistakes were made easily corrected since then – these examples should suggest parallels between old resentments and potential future conflicts when appropriate information isn't shared due to misunderstandings caused by language barriers amongst native English speakers travelling abroad especially across borders involving multiple cultures.
