Aim and object of the law and lawyers
was to defeat justice

All life seems to be sacred except
human life

Always trying to build a house by
beginning at the top

Believed it; because she desired to
believe it

resolution

But it is an ill-wind that blows nobody
good

But there are liars everywhere this
year

of Want

sunshine

horse

Fertile in invention and elastic in
conscience

Fun--but of a mild type

moan or groan or outcry

Haughty humility

I was not scared, but I was
considerably agitated

I had a delicacy about going home and
getting thrashed

If the man doesn't believe as we do, we
say he is a crank

Imagination to help his memory

Invariably allowed a half for shrinkage
in his statements

It used to be a good hotel, but that
proves nothing

It is easier to stay out than get out

It had cost something to upholster
these women

Keg of these nails--of the true cross

Let me take your grief and help you
carry it

Life a vanity and a burden, and the
future but a way to death

Man is the only animal that blushes--or
needs to

Man was not a liar he only missed it by
the skin of his teeth

Money is most difficult to get when
people need it most

looking contrivance

No people who are quite so vulgar as
the over-refined ones

No nation occupies a foot of land that
was not stolen

Nothing that glitters is gold

Notion that he is less savage than the
other savages

Nursed his woe and exalted it

Ostentatious of his modesty

Otherwise they would have thought I was
afraid, which I was

the judgment

Profound respect for chastity--in other
people

own mind exactly

Room to turn around in, but not to
swing a cat

Scenery in California requires distance

Seventy is old enough--after that,
there is too much risk

Sleep that heals all heart-aches and
ends all sorrows

Slept, if one might call such a
condition by so strong a name

Smell about them which is peculiar but
not entertaining

Takes your enemy and your friend,
working together, to hurt you

The man with a new idea is a Crank
until the idea succeeds

To a delicate stomach even imaginary
smoke can convey damage

Tourists showing how things ought to be
managed

Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry
and narrow-mindedness

Uncomplaining impoliteness

Very pleasant man if you were not in
his way

Virtuous to the verge of eccentricity

Wasn't worth a cent two years ago, and
now I owe two millions

We ought never to do wrong when people
are looking

We must create, a public opinion, said
Senator Dilworthy

Well provided with cigars and other
necessaries of life

What's a fair wind for us is a head
wind to them

Whichever one they get is the one they
want

Worth while to get tired out, because
one so enjoys resting

Wrinkles should merely indicate where
smiles have been

Your absence when you are present

MARK TWAIN'S SPEECHES

A little pride always goes along with a teaspoonful of brains
Ain't any real difference between triplets and an insurrection
Chastity, you can carry it too far
Classic: everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read
Don't know anything and can't do anything
Dwell on the particulars with senile rapture
Future great historian is lying--and doubtless will continue to
Head is full of history, and some of it is true, too
Humor enlivens and enlightens his morality
I shall never be as dead again as I was then
If can't make seventy by any but an uncomfortable road: don't go
Kill a lot of poets for writing about "Beautiful Spring"
Live upon the property of their heirs so long
Morality is all the better for his humor
Morals: rather teach them than practice them any day
Never been in jail, and the other is, I don't know why
Never to smoke when asleep, and never to refrain when awake
Patriotism is usually the refuge of the scoundrel
Please state what figure you hold him at--and return the basket
Principles is another name for prejudices
She bears our children--ours as a general thing
Some civilized women would lose half their charm without dress
The Essex band done the best it could
Time-expired man, to use Kipling's military phrase
To exaggerate is the only way I can approximate to the truth
Two kinds of Christian morals, one private and the other public
What, sir, would the people of the earth be without woman?
When in doubt, tell the truth
Women always want to know what is going on




SKETCHES NEW AND OLD

A wood-fire is not a permanent thing
Accessory before the fact to his own murder
Aggregate to positive unhappiness
Always brought in 'not guilty'
Apocryphal was no slouch of a word, emanating from the source
Assertion is not proof
Early to bed and early to rise
I am useless and a nuisance, a cumberer of the earth
I never was so scared before and survived it
If I had sprung a leak now I had been lost
Just about cats enough for three apiece all around
Looked a look of vicious happiness
Lucid and unintoxicated intervals
No matter how absurd and unreasonable their demands
No public can withstand magnanimity
Not because I was afraid, but because I wanted to (go out the window)
Permanent reliable enemy
Science only needed a spoonful of supposition to build a mountain
State of mind bordering on impatience
Walking five miles to fish
Was a good deal annoyed when it appeared he was going to die




TWAIN'S LETTERS V1 1835-1866

A mighty national menace to sham
All talk and no cider
Condition my room is always in when you are not around
Deprived of the soothing consolation of swearing
Frankness is a jewel; only the young can afford it
Genius defies the laws of perspective
Hope deferred maketh the heart sick
I never greatly envied anybody but the dead
In the long analysis of the ages it is the truth that counts
Just about enough cats to go round
Moral bulwark reared against hypocrisy and superstition
The coveted estate of silence, time's only absolute gift
We went outside to keep from getting wet
What a pleasure there is in revenge!
When in doubt, tell the truth
When it is my turn, I don't




TWAIN'S LETTERS V4 1886-1900

And I have been an author for 20 years and an ass for 55
Argument against suicide
Conversationally being yelled at
Dead people who go through the motions of life
Die in the promptest kind of a way and no fooling around
Heroic endurance that resembles contentment
Honest men must be pretty scarce
I wonder how they can lie so.  It comes of practice, no doubt
If this is going to be too much trouble to you
One should be gentle with the ignorant
Sunday is the only day that brings unbearable leisure
Symbol of the human race ought to be an ax
What a pity it is that one's adventures never happen!
