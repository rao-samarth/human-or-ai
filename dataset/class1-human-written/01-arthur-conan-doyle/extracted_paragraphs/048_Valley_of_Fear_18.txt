As he spoke the bright, yellow light in the study was obscured by
somebody passing to and fro before it. The laurels among which we lay
were immediately opposite the window and not more than a hundred feet
from it. Presently it was thrown open with a whining of hinges, and we
could dimly see the dark outline of a man's head and shoulders looking
out into the gloom. For some minutes he peered forth in furtive,
stealthy fashion, as one who wishes to be assured that he is unobserved.
Then he leaned forward, and in the intense silence we were aware of the
soft lapping of agitated water. He seemed to be stirring up the moat
with something which he held in his hand. Then suddenly he hauled
something in as a fisherman lands a fish--some large, round object which
obscured the light as it was dragged through the open casement.
