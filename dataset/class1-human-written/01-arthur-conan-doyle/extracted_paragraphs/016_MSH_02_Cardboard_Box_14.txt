until recently been the same, so that it was quite obvious how the
mistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant. Then we heard

at one time been so intimate with Miss Sarah that she had actually gone

some months, so that if Browner had occasion to address a packet to
Miss Sarah, he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address.
