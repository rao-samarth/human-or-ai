It was the fourth of February in the year 1875. It had been a severe
winter, and the snow lay deep in the gorges of the Gilmerton Mountains.
The steam ploughs had, however, kept the railroad open, and the evening
train which connects the long line of coal-mining and iron-working
settlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep gradients which
lead from Stagville on the plain to Vermissa, the central township which
lies at the head of Vermissa Valley. From this point the track sweeps
downward to Bartons Crossing, Helmdale, and the purely agricultural
county of Merton. It was a single track railroad; but at every
siding--and they were numerous--long lines of trucks piled with coal and
iron ore told of the hidden wealth which had brought a rude population
and a bustling life to this most desolate corner of the United States of
America.
