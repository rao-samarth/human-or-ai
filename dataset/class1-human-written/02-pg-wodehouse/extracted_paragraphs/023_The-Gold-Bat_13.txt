And then the senior day-room, in spite of the fact that Milton had
returned, gave itself up to celebrating the occasion with one of the
most deafening uproars that had ever been heard even in that factory of
noise. A babel of voices discussed the match of the afternoon, each
trying to outshout the other. In one corner Linton was beating wildly
on a biscuit-tin with part of a broken chair. Shoeblossom was busy in
the opposite corner executing an intricate step-dance on somebody
else's box. M'Todd had got hold of the red-hot poker, and was burning
his initials in huge letters on the seat of a chair. Every one, in
short, was enjoying himself, and it was not until an advanced hour that
comparative quiet was restored. It was a great evening for Barry, the
best he had ever experienced.
