It was not till after the all too brief intermission for rest and
recuperation that the newly formed team of Marlowe and Hignett was
scheduled to appear. Previous to this there had been dark deeds done in
the quiet saloon. The lecturer on deep-sea fish had fulfilled his
threat and spoken at great length on a subject which, treated by a
master of oratory, would have palled on the audience after ten or
fifteen minutes; and at the end of fifteen minutes this speaker had only
just got past the haddocks and was feeling his way tentatively through
the shrimps. 'The Rosary' had been sung and there was an uneasy doubt
as to whether it was not going to be sung again after the interval--the
latest rumour being that the second of the rival lady singers had proved
adamant to all appeals and intended to fight the thing out on the lines
she had originally chosen if they put her in irons.
