'On the contrary,' said Psmith, 'I could, and will. A stroll will just
restore those tissues which the gruelling work of the last half-hour
has wasted away. It is a fearful strain, this commercial toil. Let us
trickle towards the post office. I will leave my hat and gloves as a
guarantee of good faith. The cry will go round, "Psmith has gone! Some
rival institution has kidnapped him!" Then they will see my hat,'--he
built up a foundation of ledgers, planted a long ruler in the middle,
and hung his hat on it--'my gloves,'--he stuck two pens into the desk
and hung a lavender glove on each--'and they will sink back swooning
with relief. The awful suspense will be over. They will say, "No, he
has not gone permanently. Psmith will return. When the fields are white
with daisies he'll return." And now, Comrade Jackson, lead me to this
picturesque little post-office of yours of which I have heard so much.'
