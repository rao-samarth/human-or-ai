Ship's concerts are given in aid of the seamen's orphans and widows,
and, after one has been present at a few of them, one seems to feel
that any right-thinking orphan or widow would rather jog along and take
a chance of starvation than be the innocent cause of such things. They
open with a long speech from the master of the ceremonies--so long, as
a rule, that it is only the thought of what is going to happen
afterwards that enables the audience to bear it with fortitude. This
done, the amateur talent is unleashed, and the grim work begins.
