Joe Jackson's knowledge of the workings of a bank was of the slightest.
He himself had never, since he left Oxford, been in a position where
there were obstacles to getting off to play in first-class cricket. By
profession he was agent to a sporting baronet whose hobby was the
cricket of the county, and so, far from finding any difficulty in
playing for the county, he was given to understand by his employer that
that was his chief duty. It never occurred to him that Mike might find
his bank less amenable in the matter of giving leave. His only fear,
when he rang Mike up that morning, had been that this might be a
particularly busy day at the New Asiatic Bank. If there was no special
rush of work, he took it for granted that Mike would simply go to the
manager, ask for leave to play in the match, and be given it with a
beaming smile.
