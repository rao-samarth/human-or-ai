"Well, I'm in that line. I'm going to put this island on the map just
like old Doctor Blonk put Monte Carlo. I've been studying up all about
the old man, and I know just what he did and how he did it. Monte Carlo
was just such another jerkwater little place as this is before he hit
it. The government was down to its last bean and wondering where the
Heck its next meal-ticket was coming from, when in blows Mr. Man, tucks
up his shirt-sleeves, and starts the tables. And after that the place
never looked back. You and your crowd gotta get together and pass a
vote to give me a gambling concession here, same as they did him.
Scobell's my name. Hand him that, Crump."
