On three successive afternoons, O'Hara and Moriarty scoured the downs,
and on each occasion they drew blank. On the fourth day, just before
lock-up, O'Hara, who had been to tea with Gregson, of Day's, was
going over to the gymnasium to keep a pugilistic appointment with
Moriarty, when somebody ran swiftly past him in the direction of the
boarding-houses. It was almost dark, for the days were still short,
and he did not recognise the runner. But it puzzled him a little to
think where he had sprung from. O'Hara was walking quite close to the
wall of the College buildings, and the runner had passed between it and
him. And he had not heard his footsteps. Then he understood, and his
pulse quickened as he felt that he was on the track. Beneath the block
was a large sort of cellar-basement. It was used as a store-room for
chairs, and was never opened except when prize-day or some similar event
occurred, when the chairs were needed. It was supposed to be locked at
other times, but never was. The door was just by the spot where he was
standing. As he stood there, half-a-dozen other vague forms dashed past
him in a knot. One of them almost brushed against him. For a moment he
thought of stopping him, but decided not to. He could wait.
