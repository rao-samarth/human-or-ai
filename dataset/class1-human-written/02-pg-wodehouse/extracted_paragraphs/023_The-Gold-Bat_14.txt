But they were wrong. What had brought Dexter to the vault was the fact
that he had seen two boys, who looked uncommonly like O'Hara and
Moriarty, go down the steps of the vault at a quarter to six. He had
been doing his usual after-lock-up prowl on the junior gravel, to
intercept stragglers, and he had been a witness--from a distance of
fifty yards, in a very bad light--of the descent into the vault. He had
remained on the gravel ever since, in the hope of catching them as they
came up; but as they had not come up, he had determined to make the
first move himself. He had not seen the six unknowns go down, for, the
evening being chilly, he had paced up and down, and they had by a lucky
accident chosen a moment when his back was turned.
