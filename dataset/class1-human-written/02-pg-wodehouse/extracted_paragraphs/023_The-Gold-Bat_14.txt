In one corner of the room stood a gigantic globe. The problem--how did
it get into the room?--was one that had exercised the minds of many
generations of Wrykinians. It was much too big to have come through the
door. Some thought that the block had been built round it, others that
it had been placed in the room in infancy, and had since grown. To
refer the question to Mr Morgan would, in six cases out of ten, mean
instant departure from the room. But to make the event certain, it was
necessary to grasp the globe firmly and spin it round on its axis. That
always proved successful. Mr Morgan would dash down from his dais,
address the offender in spirited terms, and give him his marching
orders at once and without further trouble.
