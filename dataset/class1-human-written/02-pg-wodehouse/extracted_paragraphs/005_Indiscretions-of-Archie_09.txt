“I got him!” observed the loafer.-There is a time for all things. This
was essentially not the time for anyone of the male sex to grip the
collar of Archie's coat. If a syndicate of Dempsey, Carpentier, and one
of the Zoo gorillas had endeavoured to stay his progress at that moment,
they would have had reason to consider it a rash move. Archie wanted to
be elsewhere, and the blood of generations of Moffams, many of whom
had swung a wicked axe in the free-for-all mix-ups of the Middle Ages,
boiled within him at any attempt to revise his plans. There was a
good deal of the loafer, but it was all soft. Releasing his hold when
Archie's heel took him shrewdly on the shin, he received a nasty punch
in what would have been the middle of his waistcoat if he had worn one,
uttered a gurgling bleat like a wounded sheep, and collapsed against the
wall. Archie, with a torn coat, rounded the corner, and sprinted down
Ninth Avenue.
