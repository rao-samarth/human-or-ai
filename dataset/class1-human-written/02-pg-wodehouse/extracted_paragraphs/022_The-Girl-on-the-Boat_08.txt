He stared at the figure which loomed above him in the fading light which
came through the porthole of the state-room. The hour was seven-thirty,
and he had just woken from a troubled doze, full of strange nightmares,
and for the moment he thought that he must still be dreaming, for the
figure before him could have walked straight into any nightmare and no
questions asked. Then suddenly he became aware that it was his cousin,
Samuel Marlowe. As in the historic case of father in the pigstye, he
could tell him by his hat. But why was he looking like that? Was it
simply some trick of the uncertain light, or was his face really black
and had his mouth suddenly grown to six times its normal size and become
a vivid crimson?
