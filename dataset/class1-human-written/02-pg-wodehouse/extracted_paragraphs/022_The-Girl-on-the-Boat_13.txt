Since they had last met, at Sir Mallaby's dinner-table, Sam had told
himself perhaps a hundred times that he cared nothing about Billie, that
she had gone out of his life and was dead to him; but unfortunately he
did not believe it. A man takes a deal of convincing on a point like
this, and Sam had never succeeded in convincing himself for more than
two minutes at a time. It was useless to pretend that he did not still
love Billie more than ever, because he knew he did; and now, as the
truth swept over him for the hundred and first time, he groaned hollowly
and gave himself up to the grey despair which is the almost inseparable
companion of young men in his position.
