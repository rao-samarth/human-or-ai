'I'm afraid not, Mike. I'd manage it if I possibly could. I'm just as
anxious to see you get your Blue as you are to get it. But it's kinder
to be quite frank. I can't afford to send you to Cambridge. I won't go
into details which you would not understand; but I've lost a very large
sum of money since I saw you last. So large that we shall have to
economize in every way. I shall let this house and take a much smaller
one. And you and Bob, I'm afraid, will have to start earning your
living. I know it's a terrible disappointment to you, old chap.'
