Mr. Bennett had retired within the room when she arrived; and, going in
after him, she perceived at once what had caused his alarm. There before
her, looking more sinister than ever, stood the lunatic Peters; and
there was an ominous bulge in his right coat-pocket which to her excited
senses betrayed the presence of the revolver. What Jno. Peters was, as a
matter of fact, carrying in his right coat-pocket was a bag of mixed
chocolates which he had purchased in Windlehurst. But Billie's eyes,
though bright, had no X-ray quality. Her simple creed was that, if Jno.
Peters bulged at any point, that bulge must be caused by a pistol. She
screamed, and backed against the wall. Her whole acquaintance with Jno
Peters had been one constant backing against walls.
