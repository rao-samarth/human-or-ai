"and tell him there ain't nothin' doing in the way of rough-house wit'
dis gent here. And you can tell de Spider," went on Bat with growing
ferocity, "dat next time he gits fresh and starts in to shootin' up my
dance-joint, I'll bite de head off'n him. See? Dat goes. If he t'inks
his little two-by-four crowd can git way wit' de Groome Street, he's
got anodder guess comin'. An' don't fergit dis gent here and me is
friends, and anyone dat starts anyt'ing wit' dis gent is going to find
