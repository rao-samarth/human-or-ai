'I couldn't but admit that Jerry had picked one right from the top of
the basket. This wasn't one of them languishing sort wot sits about in

the colour of Scotch whisky, as much as to say, "Well, what

who would have me and Gentleman out of that house about three seconds
after the clergyman had tied the knot.
