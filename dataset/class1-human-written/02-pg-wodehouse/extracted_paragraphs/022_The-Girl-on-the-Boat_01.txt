The usual drove of citizens had come to see the travellers off. There
were men on the passenger-list who were being seen off by fathers, by
mothers, by sisters, by cousins, and by aunts. In the steerage, there
was an elderly Jewish lady who was being seen off by exactly
thirty-seven of her late neighbours in Rivington Street. And two men in
the second cabin were being seen off by detectives, surely the crowning
compliment a great nation can bestow. The cavernous Customs sheds were
congested with friends and relatives, and Sam Marlowe, heading for the
gang-plank, was only able to make progress by employing all the muscle
and energy which Nature had bestowed upon him, and which during the
greater part of his life he had developed by athletic exercise. However,
after some minutes of silent endeavour, now driving his shoulder into
the midriff of some obstructing male, now courteously lifting some stout
female off his feet, he had succeeded in struggling to within a few
yards of his goal, when suddenly a sharp pain shot through his right
arm, and he spun round with a cry.
