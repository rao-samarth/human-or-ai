"Tush!" said Smith. "And possibly bah! Do you suppose that the sort of
man who runs Broster Street is likely to care a darn about publicity?
What does it matter to him if the papers soak it to him for about two
days? He knows they'll drop him and go on to something else on the
third, and he knows he's broken no law. No, there's something more in
this business than that. Don't think that this bright boy wants to hush
us up simply because he is a sensitive plant who can't bear to think
that people should be cross with him. He has got some private reason
for wanting to lie low."
