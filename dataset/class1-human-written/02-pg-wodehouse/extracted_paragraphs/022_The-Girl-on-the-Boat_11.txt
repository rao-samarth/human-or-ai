His expectation of getting more satisfactory results from Bream was
fulfilled. It took some time to rouse that young man from a slumber
almost as deep as his father's; but, once roused, he showed a gratifying
appreciation of the gravity of affairs. Joy at one half of his visitor's
news competed with consternation and sympathy at the other half. He
thanked Mr. Bennett profusely, showed a fitting concern on learning of
his terrible situation, and evinced a practical desire to help by
offering him a bottle of liniment which he had found useful for
gnat-stings. Declining this, though not ungratefully, Mr. Bennett
withdrew and made his way down the passage again with something
approaching a glow in his heart. The glow lasted till he had almost
reached the landing, when it was dissipated by a soft but compelling
voice from the doorway of Miss Hubbard's room.
