Mr. Bennett continued to run; but already he had begun to pant and
falter, when he perceived looming upon his left the ruins of that
ancient castle which had so attracted him on his first visit. On that
occasion, it had made merely an aesthetic appeal to Mr. Bennett; now he
saw in a flash that its practical merits also were of a sterling order.
He swerved sharply, took the base of the edifice in his stride, clutched
at a jutting stone, flung his foot at another, and, just as his pursuer
arrived and sat panting below, pulled himself on to a ledge, where he
sat with his feet hanging well out of reach. The bulldog Smith, gazed up
at him expectantly. The game was a new one to Smith, but it seemed to
have possibilities. He was a dog who was always perfectly willing to try
anything once.
