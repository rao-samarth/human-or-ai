"Nobody," said Trevor, "except Ruthven, that is. Ruthven got to know
somehow. I believe he was a bit of a pal of Patterson's at the time.
Anyhow,--they had a row, and Ruthven went to Dexter--Patterson was in
Dexter's--and sneaked. Dexter promised to keep his name out of the
business, and went straight to the Old Man, and Patterson got turfed
out on the spot. Then somehow or other Rand-Brown got to know about
it--I believe Ruthven must have told him by accident some time or other.
After that he simply had to do everything Rand-Brown wanted him to.
Otherwise he said that he would tell the chaps about the Patterson
affair. That put Ruthven in a dead funk."
