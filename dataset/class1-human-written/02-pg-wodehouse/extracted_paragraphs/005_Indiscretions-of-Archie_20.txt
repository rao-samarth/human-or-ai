To Archie's relief, his father-in-law's symptoms showed no signs of
development. In fact, his manner reverted to the normal once more, and
a few days later, meeting Archie in the lobby of the hotel, he seemed
quite cheerful. It was not often that he wasted his time talking to his
son-in-law, but on this occasion he chatted with him for several minutes
about the big picture-robbery which had formed the chief item of news
on the front pages of the morning papers that day. It was Mr. Brewster's
opinion that the outrage had been the work of a gang and that nobody was
safe.
