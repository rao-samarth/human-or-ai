'Are you insinuating, Comrade Jackson, that my relations with Comrade
Bickersdyke are not of the most pleasant and agreeable nature possible?
How do these ideas get about? I yield to nobody in my respect for our
manager. I may have had occasion from time to time to correct him in
some trifling matter, but surely he is not the man to let such a thing
rankle? No! I prefer to think that Comrade Bickersdyke regards me as
his friend and well-wisher, and will lend a courteous ear to any
proposal I see fit to make. I hope shortly to be able to prove this to
you. I will discuss this little affair of the cheque with him at our
ease at the club, and I shall be surprised if we do not come to some
arrangement.'
