'I am unable,' he said, 'to recall at this moment the exact terms of
the very pleasant conversation I had with Comrade Bickersdyke on the
occasion of our chance meeting in the Turkish Bath that afternoon; but,
thinking things over quietly now that I have more leisure, I cannot
help feeling that he may possibly have read some such intention into my
words. You know how it is in these little chats, Comrade Jackson. One
leaps to conclusions. Some casual word I happened to drop may have
given him the idea you mention. At this distance of time it is
impossible to say with any certainty. Suffice it that all has ended
well. He _did_ reconsider his resolve. I shall be only too happy
if it turns out that the seed of the alteration in his views was sown
by some careless word of mine. Perhaps we shall never know.'
