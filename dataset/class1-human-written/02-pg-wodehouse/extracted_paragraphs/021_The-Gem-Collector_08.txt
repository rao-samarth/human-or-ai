Jimmy dressed for dinner in a very exalted frame of mind that night.
It seemed to him that he had awakened from a sort of a stupor. Life
was so much fuller of possibilities than he had imagined a few days
back. The sudden acquisition of his uncle's money had, in a manner,
brought him to a halt. Till then the exhilarating feeling of having
his hand against the world had lent a zest to life. There had been no
monotony. There had always been obstacles. One may hardly perhaps
dilate on the joys of toil in connection with him, considering the
precise methods by which he had supported himself; but nevertheless
his emotions when breaking the law of the United States had been akin
to those of the honest worker in so far that his operations had
satisfied the desire for action which possesses every man of brains
and energy. They had given him something to do. He had felt alive. His
uncle's legacy had left him with a sensation of abrupt stoppage. Life
had suddenly become aimless.
