The struggle between Prater's cat and Prater's cat's conscience was

conscience really had no sort of chance from the beginning. It was weak
by nature and flabby from long want of exercise, while the cat was in
excellent training, and was, moreover, backed up by a strong
temptation. It pocketed the stakes, which consisted of most of the
contents of a tin of sardines, and left unostentatiously by the window.

surprised, and even pained. When Montgomery entered soon afterwards, he
questioned him on the subject.
