"Oh, all sorts. My theory, laddie, is this. It doesn't matter a bit
what kind we get, because they'll all lay; and if we sell settings of
eggs, which we will, we'll merely say it's an unfortunate accident if
they turn out mixed when hatched. Bless you, people don't mind what
breed a fowl is, so long as it's got two legs and a beak. These dealer
chaps were so infernally particular. 'Any Dorkings?' they said. 'All
right,' I said, 'bring on your Dorkings.' 'Or perhaps you will require
a few Minorcas?' 'Very well,' I said, 'unleash the Minorcas.' They were
going on--they'd have gone on for hours--but I stopped 'em. 'Look here,
my dear old college chum,' I said kindly but firmly to the manager
johnny--decent old buck, with the manners of a marquess,--'look here,'
I said, 'life is short, and we're neither of us as young as we used to
be. Don't let us waste the golden hours playing guessing games. I want
fowls. You sell fowls. So give me some of all sorts. Mix 'em up,
laddie,' I said, 'mix 'em up.' And he has, by jove. You go into the
yard and look at 'em. Beale has turned them out of their crates. There
must be one of every breed ever invented."
