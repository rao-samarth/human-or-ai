I always like to think of Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge as I saw
him at that moment. There have been times during a friendship of many
years when his conduct did not recommend itself to me. It has sometimes
happened that I have seen flaws in him. But on this occasion he was at
his best. He was eloquent. He dominated his audience. Long before he
had finished I was feeling relieved that he had thought of sending Mrs.
Ukridge indoors when he did, and Beale was hanging on his words with a
look in his eyes which I had never seen there before,--a look of
reverence, almost of awe, the look of a disciple who listens to a
master.
