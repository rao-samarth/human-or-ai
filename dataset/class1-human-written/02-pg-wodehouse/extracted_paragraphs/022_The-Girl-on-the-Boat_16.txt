Sam frowned over the note. He felt injured. Sending a fellow notes
didn't give him a chance. If she had come in person and denounced him it
would not have been an agreeable experience, but at least it would have
been possible then to have pleaded and cajoled and--and all that sort of
thing. But what could he do now? It seemed to him that his only possible
course was to write a note in reply, begging her to see him. He explored
his pockets and found a pencil and a scrap of paper. For some moments he
scribbled desperately. Then he folded the note.
