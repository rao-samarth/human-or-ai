I could have wished, during the next few days, that Mr. Harry Hawk's
attitude towards myself had not been so unctuously confidential and
mysterious. It was unnecessary, in my opinion, for him to grin
meaningly when he met me in the street. His sly wink when we passed
each other on the Cob struck me as in indifferent taste. The thing had
been definitely arranged (ten shillings down and ten when it was over),
and there was no need for any cloak and dark-lantern effects. I
objected strongly to being treated as the villain of a melodrama. I was
merely an ordinary well-meaning man, forced by circumstances into doing
the work of Providence. Mr. Hawk's demeanour seemed to say, "We are two
reckless scoundrels, but bless you, _I_ won't give away your guilty
secret." The climax came one morning as I was going along the street
towards the beach. I was passing a dark doorway, when out shimmered Mr.
Hawk as if he had been a spectre instead of the most substantial man
within a radius of ten miles.
