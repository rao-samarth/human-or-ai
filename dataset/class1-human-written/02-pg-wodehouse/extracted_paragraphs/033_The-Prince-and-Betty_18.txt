But between the other gangs, and especially between the Table Hill and
the Three Points, which were much of a size, warfare raged as
frequently as among the Republics of South America. There had always
been bad blood between the Table Hill and the Three Points. Little
events, trifling in themselves, had always occurred to shatter friendly
relations just when there seemed a chance of their being formed. Thus,
just as the Table Hillites were beginning to forgive the Three Points
for shooting the redoubtable Paul Horgan down at Coney Island, a Three
Pointer injudiciously wiped out a Table Hillite near Canal Street. He
pleaded self-defense, and in any case it was probably mere
thoughtlessness, but nevertheless the Table Hillites were ruffled.
