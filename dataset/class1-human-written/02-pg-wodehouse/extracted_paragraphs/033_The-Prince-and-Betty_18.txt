That Betty had not received his information with joy did not distress
him. He had a poor opinion of the feminine intelligence. Girls got their
minds full of nonsense from reading novels and seeing plays--like Betty.
Betty objected to those who were wiser than herself providing a perfectly
good prince for her to marry. Some fool notion of romance, of course. Not
that he was angry. He did not blame her any more than the surgeon blames
a patient for the possession of an unsuitable appendix. There was no
animus in the matter. Her mind was suffering from foolish ideas, and he
was the surgeon whose task it was to operate upon it. That was all. One
had to expect foolishness in women. It was their nature. The only thing
to do was to tie a rope to them and let them run around till they were
tired of it, then pull them in. He saw his way to managing Betty.
