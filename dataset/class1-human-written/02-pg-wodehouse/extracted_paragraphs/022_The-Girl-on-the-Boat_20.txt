He stood there, shaking. The narrowness of the escape turned him cold.
If he had been an instant later, there would have been a crash loud
enough to wake a dozen sleeping houses. This sort of thing could not go
on. He must have light. It might be a risk; there might be a chance of
somebody upstairs seeing it and coming down to investigate; but it was a
risk that must be taken. He declined to go on stumbling about in this
darkness any longer. He groped his way with infinite care to the door,
on the wall adjoining which, he presumed, the electric-light switch
would be. It was nearly ten years since he had last been inside Windles,
and it never occurred to him that in this progressive age even a woman
like his Aunt Adeline, of whom he could believe almost anything, would
still be using candles and oil-lamps as a means of illumination. His
only doubt was whether the switch was where it was in most houses, near
the door.
