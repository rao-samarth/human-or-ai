'Not at all,' said Psmith deprecatingly. 'Not at all. You do not take
me. My point is this. I do not wish to revive painful memories, but it
cannot be denied that there was, here and there, some slight bickering
between us on that occasion. The fault,' said Psmith magnanimously,

Perhaps so. However, the fact remains that you conceived the happy
notion of getting me into this bank, under the impression that, once I
was in, you would be able to--if I may use the expression--give me
beans. You said as much to me, if I remember. I hate to say it, but
don't you think that if you give me the sack, although my work is
satisfactory to the head of my department, you will be by way of
admitting that you bit off rather more than you could chew? I merely
make the suggestion.'
