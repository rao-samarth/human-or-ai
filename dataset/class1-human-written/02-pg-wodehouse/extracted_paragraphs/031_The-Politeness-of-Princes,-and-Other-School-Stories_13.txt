Mr. C. F. Spencer begs to present his compliments to Mrs. Shearne,
    and returns the postal order, because he doesn't see why he should
    have it. He notes your remarks _re_ my being a decent chap in
    your favour of the 13th _prox_., but cannot see where it quite
    comes in, as the only thing I've done to Mrs. Shearne's son is to
    fight seven rounds with him in a field, W. G. Phipps refereeing. It
    was a draw. I got a black eye and rather a whack in the mouth, but
    gave him beans also, particularly in the wind, which I learned to do
    from reading "Rodney Stone"--the bit where Bob Whittaker beats the
    Eyetalian Gondoleery Cove. Hoping that this will be taken in the
    spirit which is meant,
