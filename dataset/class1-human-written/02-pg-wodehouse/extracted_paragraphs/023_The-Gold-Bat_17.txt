When there are five more minutes to play in an important house-match,
and one side has scored a goal and the other a try, play is apt to
become spirited. Both teams were doing all they knew. The ball came out
to Barry on the right. Barry's abilities as a three-quarter rested
chiefly on the fact that he could dodge well. This eel-like attribute
compensated for a certain lack of pace. He was past the Donaldson's
three-quarters in an instant, and running for the line, with only the
back to pass, and with Clowes in hot pursuit. Another wriggle took him
past the back, but it also gave Clowes time to catch him up. Clowes was
a far faster runner, and he got to him just as he reached the
twenty-five line. They came down together with a crash, Clowes on
top, and as they fell the whistle blew.
