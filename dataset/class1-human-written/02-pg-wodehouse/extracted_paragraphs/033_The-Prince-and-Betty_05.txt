It was not a long affair. The rules and conditions governing the
encounter offended the delicate sensibilities of the gang. Like artists
who feel themselves trammeled by distasteful conventions, they were
damped and could not do themselves justice. Their forte was long-range
fighting with pistols. With that they felt en rapport. But this vulgar
brawling in the darkness with muscular opponents who hit hard and often
with the clenched fist was distasteful to them. They could not develop
any enthusiasm for it. They carried pistols, but it was too dark and
the combatants were too entangled to allow them to use these.
