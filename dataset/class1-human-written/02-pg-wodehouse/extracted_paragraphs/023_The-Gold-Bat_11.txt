After four o'clock, therefore, on the next day, having had tea in his
study, he went across to the baths, in search of O'Hara. He intended
that before the evening was over the Irishman should have imparted to
him some of his skill with the hands. He did not know that for a man
absolutely unscientific with his fists there is nothing so fatal as to
take a boxing lesson on the eve of battle. A little knowledge is a
dangerous thing. He is apt to lose his recklessness--which might have
stood by him well--in exchange for a little quite useless science. He
is neither one thing nor the other, neither a natural fighter nor a
skilful boxer.
