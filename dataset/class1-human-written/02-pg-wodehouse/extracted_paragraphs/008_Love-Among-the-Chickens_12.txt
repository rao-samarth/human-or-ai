"You're catching cold, old horse," said Ukridge, all friendliness and
concern, his little differences with the professor having vanished like
thawed snow. "This'll never do. Come upstairs and get into something of
Garnet's. My own toggery wouldn't fit. What? Come along, come along,
I'll get you some hot water. Mrs. Beale--Mrs. _Beale_! We want a large
can of hot water. At once. What? Yes, immediately. What? Very well
then, as soon as you can. Now then, Garny, my boy, out with the duds.
What do you think of this, now, professor? A sweetly pretty thing in
grey flannel. Here's a shirt. Get out of that wet toggery, and Mrs.
Beale shall dry it. Don't attempt to tell me about it till you're
changed. Socks! Socks forward. Show socks. Here you are. Coat? Try this
blazer. That's right--that's right."
