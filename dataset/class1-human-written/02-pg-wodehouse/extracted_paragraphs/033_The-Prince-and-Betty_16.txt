"In the air," explained the Kid. "Bats in the belfry. Dizzy. See what I
mean? It's often like that when a feller puts one in with a bit of
weight behind it just where that one landed. Gee! I remember when I
fought Martin Kelly; I was only starting to learn the game then. Martin
and me was mixing it good and hard all over the ring, when suddenly he
puts over a stiff one right on the point. What do you think I done?
Fall down and take the count? Not on your life. I just turns round and
walks straight out of the ring to my dressing-room. Willie Harvey, who
was seconding me, comes tearing in after me, and finds me getting into
my clothes. 'What's doing, Kid?' he asks. 'I'm going fishin', Willie,'
I says. 'It's a lovely day.' 'You've lost the fight,' he says. 'Fight?'
says I. 'What fight?' See what I mean? I hadn't a notion of what had
happened. It was half an hour and more before I could remember a
thing."
