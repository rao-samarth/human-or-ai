I cannot supply the information. And, before you condemn me, let me
hastily add that the fault is not mine but that of Mrs. Hignett herself.
The fact is, she never went to Buffalo. Schenectady saw nothing of her.
She did not get within a thousand miles of Chicago, nor did she
penetrate to St. Louis. For the very morning after her son Eustace
sailed for England in the liner "Atlantic," she happened to read in the
paper one of those abridged passenger-lists which the journals of New
York are in the habit of printing, and got a nasty shock when she saw
that, among those whose society Eustace would enjoy during the voyage,
was "Miss Wilhelmina Bennett, daughter of J. Rufus Bennett of Bennett,
Mandelbaum and Co.". And within five minutes of digesting this
information, she was at her desk writing out telegrams cancelling all
her engagements. Iron-souled as this woman was, her fingers trembled as
she wrote. She had a vision of Eustace and the daughter of J. Rufus
Bennett strolling together on moonlit decks, leaning over rails damp
with sea-spray and, in short, generally starting the whole trouble all
over again.
