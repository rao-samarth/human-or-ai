Sam left the state-room and headed for the companion. He wanted to get
on deck and ascertain if that girl was still on board. About now the
sheep would be separating from the goats: the passengers would be on
deck and their friends returning to the shore. A slight tremor on the
boards on which he trod told him that this separation must have already
taken place. The ship was moving. He ran lightly up the companion. Was
she on board or was she not? The next few minutes would decide. He
reached the top of the stairs and passed out on to the crowded deck.
And, as he did so, a scream, followed by confused shouting, came from
the rail nearest the shore. He perceived that the rail was black with
people hanging over it. They were all looking into the water.
