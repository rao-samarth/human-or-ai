Trevor said nothing. He could not quite grasp the situation. It was
not only that he had got the idea so firmly into his head that it
was Rand-Brown who had sent the letters and appropriated the bat.
Even supposing he had not suspected Rand-Brown, he would never have
dreamed of suspecting Ruthven. They had been friends. Not very close
friends--Trevor's keenness for games and Ruthven's dislike of them
prevented that--but a good deal more than acquaintances. He was so
constituted that he could not grasp the frame of mind required for
such an action as Ruthven's. It was something absolutely abnormal.
