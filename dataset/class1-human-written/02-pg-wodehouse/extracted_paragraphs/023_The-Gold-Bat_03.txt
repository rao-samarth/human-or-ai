"Well, partly because the fellows left, but chiefly because they didn't
stick to the philanthropist idea. If anybody did anything they didn't
like, they used to go for him. At last they put their foot into it
badly. A chap called Robinson--in this house by the way--offended them
in some way, and one morning he was found tied up in the bath, up to
his neck in cold water. Apparently he'd been there about an hour. He
got pneumonia, and almost died, and then the authorities began to get
going. Robinson thought he had recognised the voice of one of the
chaps--I forget his name. The chap was had up by the Old Man, and gave
the show away entirely. About a dozen fellows were sacked, clean off
the reel. Since then the thing has been dropped."
