When Barry, accompanied by M'Todd, who shared his study at Seymour's
and rarely left him for two minutes on end, passed by the notice-board
at the quarter to eleven interval, it was to the second fifteen list
that he turned his attention. Now that Bryce had left, he thought he
might have a chance of getting into the second. His only real rival, he
considered, was Crawford, of the School House, who was the other wing
three-quarter of the third fifteen. The first name he saw on the list
was Crawford's. It seemed to be written twice as large as any of the
others, and his own was nowhere to be seen. The fact that he had half
expected the calamity made things no better. He had set his heart on
playing for the second this term.
