The Kid's rapid work on the present occasion created a good deal of
confusion. There was no doubt that much had been hoped for from speedy
attack. Also, the generalship of the expedition had been in the hands
of the fallen warrior. His removal from the sphere of active influence
had left the party without a head. And, to add to their discomfiture,
they could not account for the Kid. Smith they knew, and John was to be
accounted for, but who was this stranger with the square shoulders and
the uppercut that landed like a cannon ball? Something approaching a
panic prevailed among the gang.
