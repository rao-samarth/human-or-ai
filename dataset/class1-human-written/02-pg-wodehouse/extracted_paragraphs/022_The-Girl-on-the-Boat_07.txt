"I can't stand brave men," said Jane, "it makes them so independent. I
could only love a man who would depend on me in everything. Sometimes,
when I have been roughing it out in the jungle," she went on rather
wistfully, "I have had my dreams of some gentle clinging man who would
put his hand in mine and tell me all his poor little troubles and let me
pet and comfort him and bring the smiles back to his face. I'm beginning
to want to settle down. After all there are other things for a woman to
do in this life besides travelling and big-game hunting. I should like
to go into Parliament. And, if I did that, I should practically have to
marry. I mean, I should have to have a man to look after the social end
of life and arrange parties and receptions and so on, and sit
ornamentally at the head of my table. I can't imagine anything jollier
than marriage under conditions like that. When I came back a bit done up
after a long sitting at the House, he would mix me a whisky-and-soda and
read poetry to me or prattle about all the things he had been doing
during the day.... Why, it would be ideal!"
