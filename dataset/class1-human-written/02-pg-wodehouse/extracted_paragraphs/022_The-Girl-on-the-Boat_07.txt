I wish to clear myself of a possible charge of plagiarism. You smile.
Ah! but you don't know. You don't realise how careful even a splendid
fellow like myself has to be. You wouldn't have me go down to posterity
as Pelham the Pincher, would you? No! Very well, then. By the time this
volume is in the hands of the customers, everybody will, of course, have
read Mr. J. Storer Clouston's "The Lunatic at Large Again." (Those who
are chumps enough to miss it deserve no consideration.) Well, both the
hero of "The Lunatic" and my "Sam Marlowe" try to get out of a tight
corner by hiding in a suit of armour in the hall of a country-house.
Looks fishy, yes? And yet I call on Heaven to witness that I am
innocent, innocent. And, if the word of Northumberland Avenue Wodehouse
is not sufficient, let me point out that this story and Mr. Clouston's
appeared simultaneously in serial form in their respective magazines.
This proves, I think, that at these cross-roads, at any rate, there has
been no dirty work. All right, Herb., you can let 'em in now.
