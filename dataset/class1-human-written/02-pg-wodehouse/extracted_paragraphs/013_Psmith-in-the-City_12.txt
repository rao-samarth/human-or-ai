Mike had left the scene of battle by the time Psmith reached the Cash
Department, and was sitting at his desk in a somewhat dazed condition,
trying to clear his mind sufficiently to enable him to see exactly how
matters stood as concerned himself. He felt confused and rattled. He
had known, when he went to the manager's room to make his statement,
that there would be trouble. But, then, trouble is such an elastic
word. It embraces a hundred degrees of meaning. Mike had expected
sentence of dismissal, and he had got it. So far he had nothing to
complain of. But he had not expected it to come to him riding high on
the crest of a great, frothing wave of verbal denunciation. Mr
Bickersdyke, through constantly speaking in public, had developed the
habit of fluent denunciation to a remarkable extent. He had thundered
at Mike as if Mike had been his Majesty's Government or the Encroaching
Alien, or something of that sort. And that kind of thing is a little
overwhelming at short range. Mike's head was still spinning.
