One of the many things Mike could never understand in Psmith was his
fondness for getting into atmospheres that were not his own. He would
go out of his way to do this. Mike, like most boys of his age, was
never really happy and at his ease except in the presence of those of
his own years and class. Psmith, on the contrary, seemed to be bored by
them, and infinitely preferred talking to somebody who lived in quite
another world. Mike was not a snob. He simply had not the ability to be
at his ease with people in another class from his own. He did not know
what to talk to them about, unless they were cricket professionals.
With them he was never at a loss.
