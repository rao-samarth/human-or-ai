O'Hara thought. For many minutes he thought in vain. At last there came
flooding back into his mind a memory of the days of his faghood. It was
after that that he had been groping all the time. He remembered now.
Once in those days there had been an unexpected function in the middle of
term. There were needed for that function certain chairs. He could recall
even now his furious disgust when he and a select body of fellow fags had
been pounced upon by their form-master, and coerced into forming a line
from the junior block to the cloisters, for the purpose of handing
chairs. True, his form-master had stood ginger-beer after the event, with
princely liberality, but the labour was of the sort that gallons of
ginger-beer will not make pleasant. But he ceased to regret the episode
now. He had been at the extreme end of the chair-handling chain. He had
stood in a passage in the junior block, just by the door that led to the
masters' garden, and which--he remembered--was never locked till late at
night. And while he stood there, a pair of hands--apparently without a
body--had heaved up chair after chair through a black opening in the
floor. In other words, a trap-door connected with the vault in which
he now was.
