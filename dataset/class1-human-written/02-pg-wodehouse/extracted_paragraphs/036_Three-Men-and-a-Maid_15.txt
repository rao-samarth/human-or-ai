"Yes. I'd quite forgotten that Mr. Mortimer was to be on board. He has
given me all the money I shall need. You see it was this way. I had to
sail on this boat in rather a hurry. Father's head clerk was to have
gone to the bank and got some money and met me on board and given
it to me, but the silly old man was late, and when he got to the dock
they had just pulled in the gang-plank. So he tried to throw the money to
me in a handkerchief and it fell into the water. But you shouldn't have
dived in after it."
