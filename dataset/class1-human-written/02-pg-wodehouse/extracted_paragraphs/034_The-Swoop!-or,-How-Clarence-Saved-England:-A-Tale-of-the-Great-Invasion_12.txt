Clarence, brooding over the situation like a Providence, was glad to
see that already the new move had weakened the invaders' power. The day

peroxidity and blue-chinned men in dusty bowler-hats, who told each
other how they had gone with a bang at Oakham and John o'Groats, and
had then gone away in despair.
