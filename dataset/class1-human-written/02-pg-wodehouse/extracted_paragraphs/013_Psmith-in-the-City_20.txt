Psmith called for the bill and paid it in the affable manner of a
monarch signing a charter. Mike sat silent, his mind in a whirl. He saw
exactly what had happened. He could almost hear Psmith talking his
father into agreeing with his scheme. He could think of nothing to say.
As usually happened in any emotional crisis in his life, words
absolutely deserted him. The thing was too big. Anything he could say
would sound too feeble. When a friend has solved all your difficulties
and smoothed out all the rough places which were looming in your path,
you cannot thank him as if he had asked you to lunch. The occasion
demanded some neat, polished speech; and neat, polished speeches were
beyond Mike.
