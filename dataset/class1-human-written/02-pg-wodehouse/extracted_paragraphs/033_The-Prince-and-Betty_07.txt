It was Pugsy Maloney who, on the fourth morning, brought to the office
the inner history of the truce. His version was brief and unadorned, as
was the way with his narratives. Such things as first causes and
piquant details he avoided, as tending to prolong the telling
excessively, thus keeping him from the perusal of his cowboy stories.
He gave the thing out merely as an item of general interest, a bubble
on the surface of the life of a great city. He did not know how nearly
interested were his employers in any matter touching that gang which is
known as the Three Points.
