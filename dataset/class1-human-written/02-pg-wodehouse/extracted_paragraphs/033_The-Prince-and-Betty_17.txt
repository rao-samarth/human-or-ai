That Mrs. Oakley had given John the information which had enabled him
to discover her hiding-place, Betty felt certain. By what other
possible means could he have found it? Why Mrs. Oakley, whom she had
considered an ally, should have done so, she did not know. She
attributed it to a change of mind, a reconsideration of the case when
uninfluenced by sentiment. And yet it seemed strange. Perhaps John had
gone to her and the sight of him had won the old lady over to his side.
It might be so. At any rate, it meant that the cottage on Staten
Island, like the office of _Peaceful Moments_, was closed to her.
She must look elsewhere for help, or trust entirely to herself.
