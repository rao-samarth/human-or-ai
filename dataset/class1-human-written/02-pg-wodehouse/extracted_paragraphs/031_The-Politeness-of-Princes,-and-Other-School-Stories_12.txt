My Dear Spencer,--I am writing to you direct, instead of through
    your aunt, because I want to thank you so much for looking after
    my boy so well. I know what a hard time a new boy has at a public
    school if he has got nobody to take care of him at first. I heard
    from Tom this morning. He seems so happy, and so fond of you. He
    says you are "an awfully decent chap" and "the only chap who has
    stood up to him at all." I suppose he means "for him." I hope you
    will come and spend part of your holidays with us. ("Catch _me!_"
    said Spencer.)
