Pugsy vanished, and John, going to the ladder, climbed out on to the
roof with his big stick. He looked about him. The examination was
satisfactory. The trapdoor appeared to be the only means of access to
the roof, and between this roof and that of the next building there was
a broad gulf. The position was practically impregnable. Only one thing
could undo him, and that was, if the enemy should mount to the next
roof and shoot from there. And even then he would have cover in the
shape of the chimney. It was a pity that the trap opened downward, for
he had no means of securing it and was obliged to allow it to hang
open. But, except for that, his position could hardly have been
stronger.
