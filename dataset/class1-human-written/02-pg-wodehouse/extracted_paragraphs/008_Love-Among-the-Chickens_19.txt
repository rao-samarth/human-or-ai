I felt ruthless towards the professor. I cannot plead ignorance of the
golfer's point of view as an excuse for my plottings. I knew that to
one whose soul is in the game as the professor's was, the agony of
being just beaten in an important match exceeds in bitterness all other
agonies. I knew that, if I scraped through by the smallest possible
margin, his appetite would be destroyed, his sleep o' nights broken. He
would wake from fitful slumber moaning that if he had only used his
iron instead of his mashie at the tenth, all would have been well;
that, if he had putted more carefully on the seventh green, life would
not be drear and blank; that a more judicious manipulation of his
brassey throughout might have given him something to live for. All
these things I knew.
