"Why, no. I left Parker in charge. It was up to him to do what was
wanted. Say, Prince, I want to talk to you about that guy, Parker. I
understand he's been rather rough with you and your crowd. That wasn't
my doing. I didn't know anything about it till he told me. It's the
darned Wild West strain in him coming out. He used to do those sort of
things out there, and he's forgotten his manners. I pay him well, and I
guess he thinks that's the way it's up to him to earn it. You mustn't
mind Parker."
