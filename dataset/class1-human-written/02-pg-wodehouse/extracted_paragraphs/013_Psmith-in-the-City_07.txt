'That's a sample of Rossiter,' he said. 'You'd think from the fuss he's
made that the business of the place was at a standstill till we got to
work. Perfect rot! There's never anything to do here till after lunch,
except checking the stamps and petty cash, and I've done that ages ago.
There are three letters. You may as well enter them. It all looks like
work. But you'll find the best way is to wait till you get a couple of
dozen or so, and then work them off in a batch. But if you see Rossiter
about, then start stamping something or writing something, or he'll run
you in for neglecting your job. He's a nut. I'm jolly glad I'm under
old Waller now. He's the pick of the bunch. The other heads of
departments are all nuts, and Bickersdyke's the nuttiest of the lot.
Now, look here. This is all you've got to do. I'll just show you, and
then you can manage for yourself. I shall have to be shunting off to my
own work in a minute.'
