If one looks closely into those actions which are apparently due to
sudden impulse, one generally finds that the sudden impulse was merely
the last of a long series of events which led up to the action. Alone,
it would not have been powerful enough to effect anything. But, coming
after the way has been paved for it, it is irresistible. The hooligan
who bonnets a policeman is apparently the victim of a sudden impulse.
In reality, however, the bonneting is due to weeks of daily encounters
with the constable, at each of which meetings the dislike for his
helmet and the idea of smashing it in grow a little larger, till
finally they blossom into the deed itself.
