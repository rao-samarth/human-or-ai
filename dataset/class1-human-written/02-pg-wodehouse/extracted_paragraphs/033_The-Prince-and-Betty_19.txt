Master Maloney, who had taken advantage of the interruption to edge
back into the center of things, now appeared to consider the question
of his departure permanently shelved. He sidled to a corner of the
landing, and sat down on an empty soap box with the air of a dramatic
critic at the opening night of a new play. The scene looked good to
him. It promised interesting developments. He was an earnest student of
the drama, as exhibited in the theaters of the East Side, and few had
ever applauded the hero of "Escaped from Sing Sing," or hissed the
villain of "Nellie, the Beautiful Cloak-model" with more fervor. He
liked his drama to have plenty of action, and to his practised eye this
one promised well. There was a set expression on John's face which
suggested great things.
