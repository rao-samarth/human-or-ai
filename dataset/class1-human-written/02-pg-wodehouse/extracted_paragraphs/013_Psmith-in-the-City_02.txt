The morning dragged slowly on without incident. At twelve o'clock Mike
had to go out and buy stamps, which he subsequently punched in the
punching-machine in the basement, a not very exhilarating job in which
he was assisted by one of the bank messengers, who discoursed learnedly
on roses during the _seance_. Roses were his hobby. Mike began to
see that Psmith had reason in his assumption that the way to every
man's heart was through his hobby. Mike made a firm friend of William,
the messenger, by displaying an interest and a certain knowledge of
roses. At the same time the conversation had the bad effect of leading
to an acute relapse in the matter of homesickness. The rose-garden at
home had been one of Mike's favourite haunts on a summer afternoon. The
contrast between it and the basement of the new Asiatic Bank, the
atmosphere of which was far from being roselike, was too much for his
feelings. He emerged from the depths, with his punched stamps, filled
with bitterness against Fate.
