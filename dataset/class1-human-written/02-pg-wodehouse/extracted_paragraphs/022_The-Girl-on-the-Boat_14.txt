Jane Hubbard was a splendid specimen of bronzed, strapping womanhood.
Her whole appearance spoke of the open air and the great wide spaces and
all that sort of thing. She was a thoroughly wholesome, manly girl,
about the same age as Billie, with a strong chin and an eye that had
looked leopards squarely in the face and caused them to withdraw abashed
into the undergrowth, or where-ever it is that leopards withdraw when
abashed. One could not picture Jane Hubbard flirting lightly at garden
parties, but one could picture her very readily arguing with a mutinous
native bearer, or with a firm touch putting sweetness and light into the
soul of a refractory mule. Boadicea in her girlhood must have been
rather like Jane Hubbard.
