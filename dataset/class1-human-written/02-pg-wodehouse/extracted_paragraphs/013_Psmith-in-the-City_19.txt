'I am not altogether sorry that we did not,' said Psmith. 'I have
enjoyed the chances my commercial life has given me of associating with
such a man as Comrade Bickersdyke. In many ways a master-mind. But
perhaps it is as well to close the chapter. How it happened it is hard
to say, but somehow I fancy I did not precisely hit it off with Comrade
Bickersdyke. With Psmith, the worker, he had no fault to find; but it
seemed to me sometimes, during our festive evenings together at the
club, that all was not well. From little, almost imperceptible signs I
have suspected now and then that he would just as soon have been
without my company. One cannot explain these things. It must have been
some incompatibility of temperament. Perhaps he will manage to bear up
at my departure. But here we are,' he added, as the cab drew up. 'I
wonder if Comrade Jackson is still going strong.'
