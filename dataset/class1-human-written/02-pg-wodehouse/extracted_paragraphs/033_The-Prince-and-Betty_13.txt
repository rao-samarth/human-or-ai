"Merely a section, I should imagine. Comrade Parker would go to the
main boss of the gang--Bat Jarvis, if it was the Groome Street gang, or
Spider Reilly and Dude Dawson if he wanted the Three Points or the
Table Hill lot. The boss would chat over the matter with his own
special partners, and they would fix it up among themselves. The rest
of the gang would probably know nothing about it. The fewer in the
game, you see, the fewer to divide the Parker dollars. So what we have
to do is to keep a lookout for a dozen or so aristocrats of that
dignified deportment which comes from constant association with the
main boss, and, if we can elude these, all will be well."
