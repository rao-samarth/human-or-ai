Remarkable as the apparition of Mr. Bennett appeared to his daughter, the
explanation of his presence at that moment in the office of Marlowe,
Thorpe, Prescott, Winslow, and Appleby was simple. He had woken early that
morning, and, glancing at his watch on the dressing-table, he had suddenly
become aware of something bright and yellow beside it, and had paused,
transfixed, like Robinson Crusoe staring at the footprint in the sand.
If he had not been in England, he would have said it was a patch of
sunshine. Hardly daring to hope, he pulled up the shades and looked out
on the garden.
