Mr. Bennett thundered out of the room, and Sam, temporarily stunned by
the outburst, remained where he was, gaping. A few minutes
later life began to return to his palsied limbs. It occurred to him
that Mr. Bennett had forgotten to kiss him good-bye, and he went into
the outer office to tell him so. But the outer office was empty. Sam
stood for a moment in thought, then he returned to the inner office,
and, picking up a time-table, began to look out trains to the village
of Windlehurst in Hampshire, the nearest station to his aunt Adeline's
charming old-world house, Windles.
