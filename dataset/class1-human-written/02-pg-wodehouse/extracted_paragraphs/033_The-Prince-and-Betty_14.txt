_Peaceful Moments_ was closed to her. John, not finding her, might
go away, but he would return. Reluctantly, she abandoned the paper. Her
heart was heavy when she had formed the decision. She had been as happy
at _Peaceful Moments_ as it was possible for her to be now. She
would miss Smith and the leisurely work and the feeling of being one of
a team, working in a good cause. And that, brought Broster Street back
to her mind, and she thought of the children. No, she could not abandon
them. She had started the tenement articles, and she would go on with
them. But she must do it without ever venturing into the dangerous
neighborhood of the office.
