"And why did I feel like that, Comrade Brady? I will tell you. Because
my faith in you was justified. Because there before me stood the ideal
fighting editor of _Peaceful Moments_. It is not a post that any
weakling can fill. Mere charm of manner cannot qualify a man for the
position. No one can hold down the job simply by having a kind heart or
being good at comic songs. No. We want a man of thews and sinews, a man
who would rather be hit on the head with a half-brick than not. And
you, Comrade Brady, are such a man."
