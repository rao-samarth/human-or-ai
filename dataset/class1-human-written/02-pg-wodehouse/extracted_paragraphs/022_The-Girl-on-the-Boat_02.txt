"I'm glad you're back, Sam," he said at length. "I want to have a talk
with you. You know, it's time you were settling down. I've been thinking
about you while you were in America and I've come to the conclusion that
I've been letting you drift along. Very bad for a young man. You're
getting on. I don't say you're senile, but you're not twenty-one any
longer, and at your age I was working like a beaver. You've got to
remember that life is--dash it! I've forgotten it again." He broke off
and puffed vigorously into the speaking tube. "Miss Milliken, kindly
repeat what you were saying just now about life.... Yes, yes, that's
enough!" He put down the instrument. "Yes, life is real, life is
earnest," he said, gazing at Sam seriously, "and the grave is not our
goal. Lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime. In
fact, it's time you took your coat off and started work."
