Wilkins, however, took a far more modest view of his position. The
notion of leading a happy band of cricketers from Shields' into the
field had, it seemed, small attractions for him. But he went so far as
to get a house list, and help choose a really representative team. And
as details about historic teams are always welcome, we may say that
the averages ranged from 3.005 to 8.14. This last was Wilkins' own and
was, as he would have been the first to admit, substantially helped by
a contribution of nineteen in a single innings in the fifth game.
