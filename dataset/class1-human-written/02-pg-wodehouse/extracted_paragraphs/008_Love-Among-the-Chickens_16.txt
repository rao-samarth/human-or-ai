The Hired Man returned towards the end of the morning, preceded by a
cart containing the necessary wire and boxes; and Ukridge, whose
enthusiasm brooked no delay, started immediately the task of fashioning
the coops, while I, assisted by Beale, draped the wire-netting about
the chosen spot next to the paddock. There were little
unpleasantnesses--once a roar of anguish told that Ukridge's hammer had
found the wrong billet, and on another occasion my flannel trousers
suffered on the wire--but the work proceeded steadily. By the middle of
the afternoon, things were in a sufficiently advanced state to suggest
to Ukridge the advisability of a halt for refreshments.
