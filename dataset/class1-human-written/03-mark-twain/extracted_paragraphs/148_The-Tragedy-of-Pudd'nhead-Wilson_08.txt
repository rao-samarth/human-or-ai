The twins arrived presently, and talk began. It flowed along chattily
and sociably, and under its influence the new friendship gathered ease
and strength. Wilson got out his Calendar, by request, and read a
passage or two from it, which the twins praised quite cordially. This
pleased the author so much that he complied gladly when they asked him
to lend them a batch of the work to read at home. In the course of their
wide travels they had found out that there are three sure ways of
pleasing an author; they were now working the best of the three.
