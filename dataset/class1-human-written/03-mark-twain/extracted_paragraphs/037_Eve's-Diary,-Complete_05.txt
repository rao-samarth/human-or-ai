not build a shack, it could not improve melons, it could not hurry a
fruit crop; it was useless, it was a foolishness and a vanity; he would
despise it and say cutting words. But to me it was not despicable; I
said, “Oh, you fire, I love you, you dainty pink creature, for you are
BEAUTIFUL--and that is enough!” and was going to gather it to my breast.
But refrained. Then I made another maxim out of my head, though it was
so nearly like the first one that I was afraid it was only a plagiarism:
“THE BURNT EXPERIMENT SHUNS THE FIRE.”
