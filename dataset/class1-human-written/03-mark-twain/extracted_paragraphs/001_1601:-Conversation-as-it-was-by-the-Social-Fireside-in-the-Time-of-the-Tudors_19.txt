Grave historians have debated for centuries the pretensions of Elizabeth
to the title, “The Virgin Queen,” and it is utterly impossible to
dispose of the issue in a note. However, the weight of opinion appears
to be in the negative. Many and great were the difficulties attending
the marriage of a Protestant princess in those troublous times, and
Elizabeth finally announced that she would become wedded to the English
nation, and she wore a ring in token thereof until her death. However,
more or less open liaisons with Essex and Leicester, as well as a host
of lesser courtiers, her ardent temperament, and her imperious temper,
are indications that cannot be denied in determining any estimate upon
the point in question.
