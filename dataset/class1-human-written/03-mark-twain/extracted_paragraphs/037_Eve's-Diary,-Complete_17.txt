We have made long excursions, and I have seen a great deal of the world;
almost all of it, I think; and so I am the first traveler, and the only
one.  When we are on the march, it is an imposing sight--there's nothing
like it anywhere.  For comfort I ride a tiger or a leopard, because it
is soft and has a round back that fits me, and because they are such
pretty animals; but for long distance or for scenery I ride the
elephant.  He hoists me up with his trunk, but I can get off myself;
when we are ready to camp, he sits and I slide down the back way.
