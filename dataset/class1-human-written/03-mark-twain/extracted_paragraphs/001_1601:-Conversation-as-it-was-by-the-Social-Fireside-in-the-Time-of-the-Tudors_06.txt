“It was my duty to keep buttons on his shirts,” recalled Katy Leary,
life-long housekeeper and friend in the Clemens menage, “and he'd
swear something terrible if I didn't. If he found a shirt in his drawer
without a button on, he'd take every single shirt out of that drawer and
throw them right out of the window, rain or shine--out of the
bathroom window they'd go. I used to look out every morning to see
the snowflakes--anything white. Out they'd fly.... Oh! he'd swear at
anything when he was on a rampage. He'd swear at his razor if it didn't
cut right, and Mrs. Clemens used to send me around to the bathroom door
sometimes to knock and ask him what was the matter. Well, I'd go and
knock; I'd say, 'Mrs. Clemens wants to know what's the matter.' And then
he'd say to me (kind of low) in a whisper like, 'Did she hear me Katy?'
'Yes,' I'd say, 'every word.' Oh, well, he was ashamed then, he was
afraid of getting scolded for swearing like that, because Mrs. Clemens
hated swearing.” But his swearing never seemed really bad to Katy Leary,
“It was sort of funny, and a part of him, somehow,” she said. “Sort of
amusing it was--and gay--not like real swearing, 'cause he swore like an
angel.”
