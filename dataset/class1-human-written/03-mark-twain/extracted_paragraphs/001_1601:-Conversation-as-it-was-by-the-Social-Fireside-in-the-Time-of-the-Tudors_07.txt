In his later years at Stormfield Mark loved to play his favorite
billiards. “It was sometimes a wonderful and fearsome thing to watch Mr.
Clemens play billiards,” relates Elizabeth Wallace. “He loved the game,
and he loved to win, but he occasionally made a very bad stroke, and
then the varied, picturesque, and unorthodox vocabulary, acquired in his
more youthful years, was the only thing that gave him comfort. Gently,
slowly, with no profane inflexions of voice, but irresistibly as though
they had the headwaters of the Mississippi for their source, came this
stream of unholy adjectives and choice expletives.”
