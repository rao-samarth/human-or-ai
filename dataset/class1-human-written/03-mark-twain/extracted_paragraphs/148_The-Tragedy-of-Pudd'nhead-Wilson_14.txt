The twins were prodigiously great, now; the town took them to its bosom
with enthusiasm. Day after day, and night after night, they went dining
and visiting from house to house, making friends, enlarging and
solidifying their popularity, and charming and surprising all with their
musical prodigies, and now and then heightening the effects with samples
of what they could do in other directions, out of their stock of rare
and curious accomplishments. They were so pleased that they gave the
regulation thirty days' notice, the required preparation for
citizenship, and resolved to finish their days in this pleasant place.
That was the climax. The delighted community rose as one man and
applauded; and when the twins were asked to stand for seats in the
forthcoming aldermanic board, and consented, the public contentment was
rounded and complete.
