The subject seemed about talked out. Nobody seemed to have anything
further to offer. After a silence the justice of the peace informed
Wilson that he and Buckstone and the constable had come as a committee,
on the part of the Democratic party, to ask him to run for mayor--for
the little town was about to become a city and the first charter
election was approaching. It was the first attention which Wilson had
ever received at the hands of any party; it was a sufficiently humble
one, but it was a recognition of his début into the town's life and
activities at last; it was a step upward, and he was deeply gratified.
He accepted, and the committee departed, followed by young Tom.
