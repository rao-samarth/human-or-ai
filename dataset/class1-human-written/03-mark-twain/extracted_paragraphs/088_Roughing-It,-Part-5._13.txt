My two columns were filled.  When I read them over in the morning I felt
that I had found my legitimate occupation at last.  I reasoned within

higher commendation.  With encouragement like that, I felt that I could
take my pen and murder all the immigrants on the plains if need be and
the interests of the paper demanded it.
