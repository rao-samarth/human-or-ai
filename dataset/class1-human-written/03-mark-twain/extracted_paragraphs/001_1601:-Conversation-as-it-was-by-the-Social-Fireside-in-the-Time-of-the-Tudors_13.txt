“In a way,” observed William Marion Reedy, “1601 is to Twain's whole
works what the 'Droll Stories' are to Balzac's. It is better than the
privately circulated ribaldry and vulgarity of Eugene Field; is, indeed,
an essay in a sort of primordial humor such as we find in Rabelais,
or in the plays of some of the lesser stars that drew their light from
Shakespeare's urn. It is humor or fun such as one expects, let us say,
from the peasants of Thomas Hardy, outside of Hardy's books. And,
though it be filthy, it yet hath a splendor of mere animalism of good
spirits... I would say it is scatalogical rather than erotic, save for
one touch toward the end. Indeed, it seems more of Rabelais than of
Boccaccio or Masuccio or Aretino--is brutally British rather than
lasciviously latinate, as to the subjects, but sumptuous as regards the
language.”
