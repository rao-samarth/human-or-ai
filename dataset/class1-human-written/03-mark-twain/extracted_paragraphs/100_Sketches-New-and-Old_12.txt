At that time, in Kentucky (said the Hon. Mr. K-----); the law was very
strict against what is termed “games of chance.”  About a dozen of the
boys were detected playing “seven up” or “old sledge” for money, and the
grand jury found a true bill against them.  Jim Sturgis was retained to
defend them when the case came up, of course. The more he studied over
the matter, and looked into the evidence, the plainer it was that he must
lose a case at last--there was no getting around that painful fact.
Those boys had certainly been betting money on a game of chance.  Even
public sympathy was roused in behalf of Sturgis.  People said it was a
pity to see him mar his successful career with a big prominent case like
this, which must go against him.
