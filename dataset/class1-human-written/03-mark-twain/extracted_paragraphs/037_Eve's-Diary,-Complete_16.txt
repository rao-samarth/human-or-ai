Was she satisfied now?  No. Nothing ever satisfies her but
demonstration; untested theories are not in her line, and she won't have
them. It is the right spirit, I concede it; it attracts me; I feel the
influence of it; if I were with her more I think I should take it up
myself.  Well, she had one theory remaining about this colossus: she
thought that if we could tame it and make him friendly we could stand in
the river and use him for a bridge.  It turned out that he was already
plenty tame enough--at least as far as she was concerned--so she tried
her theory, but it failed:  every time she got him properly placed in
the river and went ashore to cross over him, he came out and followed
her around like a pet mountain.  Like the other animals.  They all do
that.
