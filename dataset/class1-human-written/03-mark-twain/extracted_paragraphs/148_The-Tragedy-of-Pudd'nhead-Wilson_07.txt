The theft-raid which he had made upon the village turned out better than
he had ventured to hope. It produced the sum necessary to pay his
gaming-debts, and saved him from exposure to his uncle and another
smashing of the will. He and his mother learned to like each other
fairly well. She couldn't love him, as yet, because there "warn't
nothing to him," as she expressed it, but her nature needed something or
somebody to rule over, and he was better than nothing. Her strong
character and aggressive and commanding ways compelled Tom's admiration
in spite of the fact that he got more illustrations of them than he
needed for his comfort. However, as a rule her conversation was made up
of racy tattle about the privacies of the chief families of the town
(for she went harvesting among their kitchens every time she came to the
village), and Tom enjoyed this. It was just in his line. She always
collected her half of his pension punctually, and he was always at the
haunted house to have a chat with her on these occasions. Every now and
then she paid him a visit there on between-days also.
