And for each one he had some kindly word of greeting and remembrance.
Then he bade them give at once a specimen of their powers; and as
a proof of the breadth of Hamlet’s nature, and the wideness of his
sympathies, may be noted the fact that he was as much at home in
discussing stage matters with the players as in musing over deep
philosophies of life by himself. He recalled to their memory a play
which had formerly struck his fancy, though it had never been acted,
or, if it were, not above once, for it was too refined for the taste
of the million--“caviare to the general,” as Hamlet expressed it.
Hamlet himself recited a speech from this play with excellent taste
and elocution, and the chief player continued the touching passage
with much pathos.
