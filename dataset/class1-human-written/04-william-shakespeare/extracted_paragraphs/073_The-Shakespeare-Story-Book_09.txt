Oliver was made welcome by the Duke, and was afterwards talking
to Orlando in his own cave, when his brother, calling on the name
of Rosalind, suddenly fainted. His arm had been badly torn by the
lioness, and had been bleeding all this time. Oliver revived him,
bound up the wound, and after a little, Orlando, being brave of heart,
begged his brother, stranger as he was, to find his friends at the
shepherd’s cottage, and explain to them why he had been unable to
keep his promise. He sent the handkerchief dyed in his blood to the
shepherd youth whom he had called in sport his Rosalind.
