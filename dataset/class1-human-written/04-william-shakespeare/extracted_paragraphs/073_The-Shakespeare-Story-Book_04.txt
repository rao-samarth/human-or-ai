The third bout of fencing began, and this time it was more vigorous
than before, for Hamlet reproached Laertes for not putting forth his
full powers. A feeling of shame had doubtless hitherto restrained
Laertes, and he felt that what he was going to do was almost against
his conscience. Nevertheless, he now thrust in good earnest. He
wounded Hamlet, but in the scuffle his rapier flew out of his hand.
Hamlet tossed his own weapon to Laertes, and picked up the poisoned
one which had fallen to the ground. The struggle was resumed, and this
time Hamlet wounded Laertes. The match begun in play was becoming
serious.
