So when Bassanio came to him to ask for a loan of three thousand ducats
to Antonio for three months, Shylock hid his hatred, and turning to
Antonio, said--“Harshly as you have treated me, I would be friends with
you and have your love. So I will lend you the money and charge you no
interest. But, just for fun, you shall sign a bond in which it shall be
agreed that if you do not repay me in three months' time, then I shall
have the right to a pound of your flesh, to be cut from what part of
your body I choose.”
