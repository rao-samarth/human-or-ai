There is no reason to doubt that the _words_ are as Shakespeare wrote
them, for, although the action of the play terminates in less than four
hours (I. 2. 240 and V. 1. 186), yet Ariel’s ministry is not to end till
the voyage to Naples shall be over. Prospero, too, repeats his promise,
and marks his contentment by further shortening the time of servitude,
‘within two days,’ I. 2. 420. Possibly ‘Invisible’ (301) should have a
line to itself. Words thus occupying a broken line acquire a marked
emphasis.
