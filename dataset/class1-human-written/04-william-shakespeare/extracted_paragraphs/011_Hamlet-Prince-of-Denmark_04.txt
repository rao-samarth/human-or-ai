[Footnote II.27: _For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog,
    being a god, kissing carrion,----Have you a daughter?_] _i.e._,
    Hamlet having just remarked that honesty is very rare in the
    world, adds, that since there is so little virtue, since
    corruption abounds everywhere, and maggots are _bred_ by the sun,
    which is a god, even in a dead dog, Polonius ought to take care
    to prevent his daughter from walking in the sun, lest she should
    prove _"a breeder of sinners;"_ for though _conception_
    (understanding) in general be a blessing, yet as Ophelia might
    chance to _conceive_ (to be pregnant), it might be a calamity.
    Hamlet's abrupt question, _"Have you a daughter?"_ is evidently
    intended to impress Polonius with the belief of the Prince's
    madness.--MALONE.]
