Gifford explains the expression thus: "_Dun in the mire_ is a Christmas
gambol, at which I have often played. A log of wood is brought into the
midst of the room: this is _Dun_ (the cart-horse), and a cry is raised
that he is _stuck in the mire_. Two of the company advance, either with
or without ropes, to draw him out. After repeated attempts, they find
themselves unable to do it, and call for more assistance. The game
continues till all the company take part in it, when Dun is extricated
of course; and the merriment arises from the awkward and affected
efforts of the rustics to lift the log, and from sundry arch
contrivances to let the ends of it fall on one another's toes. This will
not be thought a very exquisite amusement; and yet I have seen much
honest mirth at it." Halliwell-Phillipps quotes _Westward Hoe_, 1607: "I
see I'm born still to draw dun out o' th' mire for you; that wise beast
will I be;" and Butler, _Remains_: "they meant to leave reformation,
like Dun in the mire."
