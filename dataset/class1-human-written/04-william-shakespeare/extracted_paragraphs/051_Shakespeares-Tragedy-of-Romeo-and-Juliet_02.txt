"heaven is here,
  Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog
  And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
  Live here in heaven and may look on her,
  But Romeo may not. More validity,
  More honourable state, more courtship lives
  In carrion-flies than Romeo. They may seize
  On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
  And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
  Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
  Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin:
  But Romeo may not, he is banished.
  This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
  They are free men, but I am banished."
