_{F}en._ Then thus my host. Tis not vnknown to you,
The feruent loue _I_ beare to young _Anne Page_,
And mutally her loue againe to mee:
But her father still against her choise,
Doth seeke to marrie her to foolish _Slender_,                      10
And in a robe of white this night disguised,
Wherein fat _Falstaffe_ had a mightie scare,
Must _Slender_ take her and carrie her to _Catlen_,
And there vnknowne to any, marrie her.
Now her mother still against that match,                            15
And firme for Doctor _Cayus_, in a robe of red
By her deuice, the Doctor must steale her thence,
And she hath giuen consent to goe with him.
