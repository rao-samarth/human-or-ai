_Mis. Pa._ Let vs alone for that. Heare my deuice.
Oft haue you heard since _Horne_ the hunter dyed,
That women to affright their litle children,
Ses that he walkes in shape of a great stagge.
Now for that _{F}alstaffe_ hath bene so deceiued,                   20
As that he dares not venture to the house,
Weele send him word to meet vs in the field,
Disguised like _Horne_, with huge horns on his head.
The houre shalbe iust betweene twelue and one,
And at that time we will meet him both:                             25
Then would I haue you present there at hand,
With litle boyes disguised and dressed like Fayries,
For to affright fat _{F}alstaffe_ in the woods.
And then to make a period to the Iest,
Tell _Falstaffe_ all, I thinke this will do best.                   30
