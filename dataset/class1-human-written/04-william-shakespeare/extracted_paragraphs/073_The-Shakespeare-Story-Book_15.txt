The second parting of Romeo and Juliet at the balcony looking into
Capulet’s orchard was very different from the first. Then, indeed,
Romeo had reluctantly torn himself away; but, after all, they had
another happier meeting to look forward to on the morrow. Now, all
was gloom and uncertainty, and who knew when they would ever see each
other again? The lark, the herald of the morning, that sang joyously
high overhead,--the golden rays of dawn that pierced the eastern
clouds,--only brought sadness to the hearts of the young husband and
wife, for they told that the fatal hour of parting had come. Longing
to keep Romeo with her, yet dreading the peril he ran if he delayed
too long, Juliet one moment implored him to stay, and the next urged
him to depart.
