“About, my brain! Hum!--I have heard that guilty creatures, sitting at
a play, have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the
soul that presently they have proclaimed their ill deeds; for murder,
though it have no tongue, will speak in most miraculous fashion. I’ll
have these players play something like the murder of my father before
mine uncle; I’ll observe his looks; I’ll tent him to the quick; if
he but blench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen may be
the devil; and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape. I’ll
have grounds more relative than this,” concluded Hamlet, touching the
tablets on which he had inscribed the message from the Ghost. “The
play’s the thing wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King.”
