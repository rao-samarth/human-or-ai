Shunned, hated, despised, insulted, the Jews in the Middle Ages led
a cruel and embittered existence among their Christian brethren. But
beaten down and oppressed as they were in most of the countries of
Europe, they still prospered as far as money matters were concerned,
and, in spite of the demands continually levied on them, they
contrived to amass large hoards of wealth. When the great nobles or
merchant princes of those days got into difficulties, it was to the
Jews they turned for help, and the enormous sums charged as interest
for the loan enabled the Jews to fill their coffers rapidly.
