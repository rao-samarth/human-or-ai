_Fal._ The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute
draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me! Remember,
Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love set
on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some respects,
makes a beast a man; in some other, a man a beast. You               5
were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love of Leda. O omnipotent
Love! how near the god drew to the complexion of a
goose!--A fault done first in the form of a beast;--O Jove,
a beastly fault! And then another fault in the semblance
of a fowl;--think on’t, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have          10
hot backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a
Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i’ the forest. Send
me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can blame me to piss my
tallow?--Who comes here? my doe?
