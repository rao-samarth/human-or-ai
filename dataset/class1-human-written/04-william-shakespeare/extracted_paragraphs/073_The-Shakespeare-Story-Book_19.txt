The new Queen was a crafty, designing woman, whose chief aim at
present was to secure the future throne for her boorish son.
Cymbeline, it is true, had had two sons of his own, but they were
both stolen when they were little more than babies, the eldest being
only three, and the youngest, two years old. From the day of their
disappearance no trace of them had ever been found. The Princess
Imogen was now the only child, and as Cymbeline’s heir, the Queen was
anxious to entice her into a marriage with her son. When this attempt
failed, the Queen did not scruple to plan other and darker means to
accomplish her purpose. She had some knowledge of medicine, and took
pleasure in making perfumes and preserves from all sorts of herbs and
simples. Under pretence of perfecting her knowledge, she begged from a
physician, Cornelius--who had helped her with her studies--some most
poisonous compounds, which would produce a languishing death. She said
she did not intend to use them on human beings, but only on animals,
to try their power, and apply the antidote, in order to discover their
respective virtues and effects.
