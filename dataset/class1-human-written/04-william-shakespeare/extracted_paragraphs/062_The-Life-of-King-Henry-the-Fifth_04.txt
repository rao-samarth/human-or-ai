GOWER. Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the mines;
the
    Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.
  FLUELLEN. To the mines! Tell you the Duke it is not so good to
come
    to the mines; for, look you, the mines is not according to
the
    disciplines of the war; the concavities of it is not
sufficient.
    For, look you, th' athversary- you may discuss unto the Duke,
    look you- is digt himself four yard under the countermines;
by
    Cheshu, I think 'a will plow up all, if there is not better
    directions.
  GOWER. The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege
is
    given, is altogether directed by an Irishman- a very vallant
    gentleman, i' faith.
  FLUELLEN. It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?
  GOWER. I think it be.
  FLUELLEN. By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I will
verify
    as much in his beard; he has no more directions in the true
    disciplines of the wars, look you, of the Roman disciplines,
than
    is a puppy-dog.
