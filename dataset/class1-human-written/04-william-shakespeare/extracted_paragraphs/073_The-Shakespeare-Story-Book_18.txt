speak of one that loved not wisely but too well; of one not easily
jealous, but being wrought, perplexed in the extreme; of one whose
hand, like the base Indian, threw a pearl away richer than all his
tribe.... Set you down this; and say besides, that in Aleppo once,
where a malignant and a turbaned Turk beat a Venetian and traduced the
State, I took by the throat the circumcised dog, and smote him--thus.”
