KING.
No, sir, it does not please me.
I had thought I had had men of some understanding
And wisdom of my council; but I find none.
Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,
This good man,--few of you deserve that title,--
This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy
At chamber-door? and one as great as you are?
Why, what a shame was this!  Did my commission
Bid ye so far forget yourselves?  I gave ye
Power as he was a councillor to try him,--
Not as a groom.  There's some of ye, I see,
More out of malice than integrity,
Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;
Which ye shall never have while I live.
