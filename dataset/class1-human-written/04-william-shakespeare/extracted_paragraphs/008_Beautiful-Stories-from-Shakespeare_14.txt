How long acting continued to be Shakespeare's sole profession we have
no means of knowing, but it is in the highest degree probable that very
soon after arriving in London he began that work of adaptation by which
he is known to have begun his literary career. To improve and alter
older plays not up to the standard that was required at the time was
a common practice even among the best dramatists of the day, and
Shakespeare's abilities would speedily mark him out as eminently fitted
for this kind of work. When the alterations in plays originally composed
by other writers became very extensive, the work of adaptation would
become in reality a work of creation. And this is exactly what we have
examples of in a few of Shakespeare's early works, which are known to
have been founded on older plays.
