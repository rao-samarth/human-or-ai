This book contains nothing more than every young person should know
about the construction of English verse, and its main divisions, both by
forms and by subject-matter. The historical development of the main
divisions is sketched, and briefly illustrated by representative
examples; but the true character of poetry as an art and as a social
force has always been in the writer's mind. Only the elements of prosody
are given. The aim has been not to make the study too technical, but to
interest the student in poetry, and to aid him in acquiring a
well-rooted taste for good literature.
