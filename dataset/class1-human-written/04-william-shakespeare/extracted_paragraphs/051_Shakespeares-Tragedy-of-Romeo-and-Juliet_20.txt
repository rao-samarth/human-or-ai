_Nurse._ Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every
  part about me quivers. Scurvy knave!--Pray you,
  sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bade
  me inquire you out; what she bade me say, I will
  keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should
  lead her in a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a
  very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the
  gentlewoman is young, and, therefore, if you should              160
  deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be
  offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
