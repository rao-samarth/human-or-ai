I think I knowe not my selfe. Why what a Gods name doth this man
see in me, that thus he shootes at my honestie? Well but that I
knowe my owne heart, I should scarcely perswade my selfe I were
hand. Why what an vnreasonable woolsack is this. He was neuer
twice in my companie, and if then I thought I gaue such assurance   15
with my eies, Ide pull them out, they should neuer see more holie
daies. Well, I shall trust fat men the worse while I liue for his sake.
O God, that I knew how to be reuenged of him. But in good time,
heeres mistresse _Foord_.
