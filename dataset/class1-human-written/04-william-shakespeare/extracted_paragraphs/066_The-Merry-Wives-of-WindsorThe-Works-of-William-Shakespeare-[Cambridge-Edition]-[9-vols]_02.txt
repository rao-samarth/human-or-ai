_Fal._ O, she did so course o’er my exteriors with such             60

scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here’s another letter
to her: she bears the purse too; she is a region in Guiana,
all gold and bounty. I will be cheaters to them both, and
they shall be exchequers to me; they shall be my East               65
and West Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear
thou this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to Mistress
Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.
