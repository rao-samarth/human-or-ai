GOWER. Nay, that's right; but why wear you your leek to-day?
Saint
    Davy's day is past.
  FLUELLEN. There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in
all
    things. I will tell you, ass my friend, Captain Gower: the
    rascally, scald, beggarly, lousy, pragging knave, Pistol-
which
    you and yourself and all the world know to be no petter than
a
    fellow, look you now, of no merits- he is come to me, and
prings
    me pread and salt yesterday, look you, and bid me eat my
leek; it
    was in a place where I could not breed no contendon with him;
but
    I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once
    again, and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires.
