When he left, Iago took occasion to spread a bad impression of him by
saying what a pity it was that such a good soldier should be spoilt by
the persistent habit of drink--in fact, that he never went sober to
bed. This, of course, was an absolute falsehood, but the gentlemen of
Cyprus believed what Iago said. Montano remarked it was a pity Othello
were not told of it; perhaps he did not know, or perhaps his good
nature prized the virtue in Cassio, and overlooked the evil. It was a
great pity that the noble Moor should hazard such an important place
as second in command to one with such an incurable fault. It would be
right to say so to Othello.
