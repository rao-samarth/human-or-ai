“You fools! I and my fellows are ministers of Fate. Your swords might
as well try to wound the winds or stab the water, as hurt one feather
of my plumage. If you could hurt, your swords are now too heavy for
your strength, and you cannot lift them. But remember--for this is my
business to you--that you three supplanted the good Duke Prospero from
Milan, cast him and his innocent child adrift on the sea, which hath
now revenged it. The heavenly powers have delayed punishment for this
foul deed, but they have not forgotten it, and now they have incensed
the sea and the shore and all creatures against you. They have bereft
you, Alonso, of your son, and they pronounce by me that lingering
perdition worse than any death shall fall in this desolate island on
you and all your ways, unless you heartily repent and amend your life.”
