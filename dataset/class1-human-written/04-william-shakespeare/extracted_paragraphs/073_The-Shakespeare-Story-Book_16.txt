“Madness!” echoed Hamlet; and he bade his mother note that his
pulse beat as calmly as her own, and that it was not madness which
he uttered. Bring him to the test, he said, and he would re-word
the matter, which madness could not do. In short, his words were so
convincing that the Queen could no longer refuse to believe them.
Before they parted, she promised to adopt a very different mode of
behaviour from her usual pleasure-loving frivolity, and not to allow
herself to be persuaded by the crafty Claudius that anything her son
might say or do arose from madness.
