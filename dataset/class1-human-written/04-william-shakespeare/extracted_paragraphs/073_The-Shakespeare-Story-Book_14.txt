The first humiliation to Katharine was the lateness of the
bridegroom’s arrival, but still more mortifying to her pride, when he
did at last appear, was the extraordinary array in which he had chosen
to attire himself. His hat was new, but his jerkin was old, and his
breeches had been turned three times; his boots were not a pair, one
was buckled, the other laced; and he had taken out of the town armoury
a rusty old sword with a broken hilt. His horse was a poor wretched
creature, scarcely able to hobble, and the rotten harness was pieced
together with pack-thread. His servant, Grumio, was equipped in the
same fashion, all odds and ends, a linen stocking on one leg and a
woollen one on the other, gartered with red and blue list; an old hat
with a tattered rag of a feather--in fact, he was a perfect guy in
dress, not like a Christian foot-boy or a gentleman’s lackey.
