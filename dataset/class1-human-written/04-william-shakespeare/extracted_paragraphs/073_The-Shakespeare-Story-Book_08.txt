Rosalind now for the first time rather regretted her boy’s dress,
for, of course, Orlando did not recognise the cousins in their
present attire. But, at any rate, in the guise of a saucy youth she
determined to have a little fun, and presently a whimsical idea
occurred to her nimble brain. Seeing how disconsolate Orlando was, she
suggested to him that she should _pretend_ to be really his Rosalind,
and that he should address all his affectionate speeches and verses to
her exactly in the same way as he would have done to the real person.
If he did this, she said, she would soon cure him of his love.
