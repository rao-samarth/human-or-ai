_King._ (R.C.) Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
  The memory be green;[24] and that it us befitted
  To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
  To be contracted in one brow of woe;
  Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature,
  That we with wisest sorrow[25] think on him,
  Together with remembrance of ourselves.
  Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
  The imperial jointress of this warlike state,
  Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,[26]
  Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd[27]
  Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
  With this affair along:--For all, our thanks.
  And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
  You told us of some suit; What is't, Laertes?
