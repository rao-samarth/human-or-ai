"But now what shall betyde of this gray-bearded syre?
  Of fryer Lawrence thus araynde, that good barefooted fryre?
  Because that many times he woorthely did serve
  The commen welth, and in his lyfe was never found to swerve,
  He was discharged quyte, and no marke of defame
  Did seeme to blot or touch at all the honor of his name.
  But of him selfe he went into an Hermitage,
  Two myles from Veron towne, where he in prayers past forth his age;
  Till that from earth to heaven his heavenly sprite dyd flye:
  Fyve yeres he lived an Hermite, and an Hermite dyd he dye."
