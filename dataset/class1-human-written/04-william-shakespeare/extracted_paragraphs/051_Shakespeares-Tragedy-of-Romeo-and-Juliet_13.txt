Mrs. Jameson remarks: "The old woman, true to her vocation, and fearful
lest her share in these events should be discovered, counsels her to
forget Romeo and marry Paris; and the moment which unveils to Juliet the
weakness and baseness of her confidante is the moment which reveals her
to herself. She does not break into upbraidings; it is no moment for
anger; it is incredulous amazement, succeeded by the extremity of scorn
and abhorrence, which takes possession of her mind. She assumes at once
and asserts all her own superiority, and rises to majesty in the
strength of her despair."
