SCENE II.--1. _He jests_, etc. Referring to Mercutio, whom he has
overheard, as the rhyme in _found_ and _wound_ indicates. The Cambridge
ed. suggests that in the old arrangement of the scene the wall may have
been represented as dividing the stage, so that the audience could see
Romeo on one side and Mercutio on the other. Mr. F.A. Marshall thinks
that Romeo "merely stepped to the back of the stage at the beginning of
the scene, and was supposed to be concealed from the others, not coming
out till they had gone. Juliet would appear on the 'upper stage' [the
balcony at the back of the Elizabethan stage], which did duty in the old
plays for so many purposes."
