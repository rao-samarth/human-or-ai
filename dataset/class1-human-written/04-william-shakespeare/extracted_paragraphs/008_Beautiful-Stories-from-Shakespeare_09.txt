While Puck was gone, Demetrius passed through the glade followed by poor
Helena, and still she told him how she loved him and reminded him of all
his promises, and still he told her that he did not and could not love
her, and that his promises were nothing. Oberon was sorry for poor
Helena, and when Puck returned with the flower, he bade him follow
Demetrius and put some of the juice on his eyes, so that he might love
Helena when he woke and looked on her, as much as she loved him. So
Puck set off, and wandering through the wood found, not Demetrius, but
Lysander, on whose eyes he put the juice; but when Lysander woke, he saw
not his own Hermia, but Helena, who was walking through the wood looking
for the cruel Demetrius; and directly he saw her he loved her and left
his own lady, under the spell of the purple flower.
