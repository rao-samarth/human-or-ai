In the meantime, Oliver having sought to take his brother Orlando's
life, Orlando also wandered into the forest, and there met with the
rightful Duke, and being kindly received, stayed with him. Now, Orlando
could think of nothing but Rosalind, and he went about the forest
carving her name on trees, and writing love sonnets and hanging them on
the bushes, and there Rosalind and Celia found them. One day Orlando met
them, but he did not know Rosalind in her boy's clothes, though he liked
the pretty shepherd youth, because he fancied a likeness in him to her
he loved.
