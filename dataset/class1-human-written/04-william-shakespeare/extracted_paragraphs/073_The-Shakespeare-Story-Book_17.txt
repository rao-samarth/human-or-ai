The happiness resulting from Bassanio’s choice of the right casket
did not end with themselves, for now another couple stepped forward,
and craved permission to be married at the same time as the lord and
the lady. One of Bassanio’s companions had come with him to Belmont,
a gay, feather-brained young fellow called Gratiano. This lively
chatterer had fixed his affections on Nerissa, the waiting-woman, and
their fate, too, hung on the caskets, for Nerissa promised that if
Bassanio succeeded in winning her mistress, _she_ would consent to
marry Gratiano. Nerissa, further, in imitation of Portia, gave her own
wooer a ring; and Gratiano, like Bassanio, swore that he would never
part with it.
