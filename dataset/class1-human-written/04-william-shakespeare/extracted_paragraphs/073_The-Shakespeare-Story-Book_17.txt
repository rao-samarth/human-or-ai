The King and Queen were deeply grieved at this new misfortune that had
fallen on their young favourite, for the Queen, at least, loved her
tenderly. They had also grounds for uneasiness concerning themselves;
disquieting rumours began to be current. Rather foolishly, they had
tried to hush up the cause of Polonius’s death, and had had him
hurriedly interred, without proper rites or ceremony. His son Laertes
had come secretly from France, and tittle-tattlers were not lacking to
pour into his ears malicious reports of his father’s death. Finally,
there was an attempt at insurrection. Laertes went to the palace,
followed by a riotous mob, shouting, “Laertes shall be King! Laertes
King!” They broke down the doors, overcame the guard, and Laertes
forced his way into the presence of the King and Queen.
