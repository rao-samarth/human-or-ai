A text-book for a year's course in schools and colleges, in which
English literary history is regarded as composed of periods, each marked
by a definite tone of thought and manner of expression. The treatment
follows the divisions logically and systematically, without any of the
perplexing cross divisions so frequently made. It is based on the
historic method of study, and refers briefly to events in each period
bearing on social development, to changes in religious and political
theory, and even to advances in the industrial arts. In addition, the
book contains critiques, general surveys, summaries, biographical
sketches, bibliographies, and suggestive questions. The examples have
been chosen from poems which are generally familiar, and of an
illustrative character.
