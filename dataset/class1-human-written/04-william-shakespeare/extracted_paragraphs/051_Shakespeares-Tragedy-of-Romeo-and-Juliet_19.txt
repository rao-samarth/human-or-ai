Malone cites both this last passage and _V. and A._ 482 as referring to
blue eyes; but the "azure _lac'd_" ought to settle the question in
regard to the former, and "windows" evidently has the same meaning in
both. If the "blue windows" _were_ blue eyes, Malone would make out his
case, for in _V. and A._ 140 the goddess says "Mine eyes are grey and
bright." But why should the poet call them _blue_ in the one place and
_grey_ in the other, when the former word would suit the verse equally
well in both? In my opinion, when he says _blue_ he means blue, and when
he says _grey_ he means grey. See on ii. 3. 1 above. The _New Eng.
Dict._ does not recognize blue as a meaning of _grey_. It seems,
however, from certain passages in writers of the time that the word was
sometimes = bluish grey or bluish; but never "bright blue" (as Delius
defines it) or clear blue, as Dyce and others assume.
