_Lucio._ Why? For filling a bottle with a tun-dish. I
would the Duke we talk of were returned again: this ungenitured
agent will unpeople the province with continency;
sparrows must not build in his house-eaves, because                165
they are lecherous. The Duke yet would have dark deeds
darkly answered; he would never bring them to light:
would he were returned! Marry, this Claudio is condemned
for untrussing. Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for
me. The Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on             170
Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee, he would
mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown bread and
garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.    [_Exit._
