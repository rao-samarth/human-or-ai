When the rightful Duke was sent into banishment, Frederick, the
usurping Duke, allowed his daughter Rosalind to stay on at Court,
to be a companion to his own young daughter Celia. The cousins had
been brought up together from their cradles, and were so devoted to
each other that if Rosalind had been sent into banishment Celia would
either have followed her or died of grief at the separation. Celia
strove by all the means in her power to cheer her cousin’s sorrow for
the loss of her father, and assured her that when Duke Frederick died
she would never consent to be his heir, but would immediately restore
to Rosalind all that he had wrongfully taken away.
