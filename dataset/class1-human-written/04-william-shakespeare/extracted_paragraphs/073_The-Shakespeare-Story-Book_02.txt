But with eager words Lady Macbeth tried to calm the startled guests,
assuring them that it was only a momentary fit of illness, such as
Macbeth had been accustomed to from his youth. “Eat, and regard him
not,” she implored them, and then, in a stern undertone, she tried
to rouse her husband from his fit of dazed terror. But Macbeth was
heedless of her entreaties. With starting eyes he watched the ghastly
figure which his guilty brain alone could see, and it was only when
the vision melted away that he recovered from the sort of stupor into
which he had fallen. Then, for a brief moment, he spoke cheerfully,
and, calling for wine, he drank to the health of all present.
