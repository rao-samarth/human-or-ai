But although Shakespeare’s borrowings from the frank and vivacious
fiction of sunny Italy were large and open-handed, his debt was
greater in appearance than it was in reality. He freely altered and
adapted the borrowed stories in accordance with his sense of dramatic
and artistic fitness, so that the finished plays present them in
shapes which bear little relation to their original forms. At times
he intertwined one borrowed story with a second, and his marvellous
ingenuity completely changed the aspect of both; each assumed new and
unexpected point and consistency. With such effect did he combine in
_The Merchant of Venice_ the story of the caskets with the story of
Shylock’s bond with Antonio. His capacity of assimilating all that he
read was as omnipotent as his power of assimilating all that passed
in life within range of his eye or ear. The stories that he drew from
books on which to found his plays can only be likened to base ore,
which the magic of his genius had the faculty of transmuting into gold.
