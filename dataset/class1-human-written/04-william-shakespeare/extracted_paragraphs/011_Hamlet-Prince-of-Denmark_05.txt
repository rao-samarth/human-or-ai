_Ham._ O, that this too, too solid flesh would melt,
  Thaw, and resolve itself[46] into a dew!
  Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
  His canon[47] 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!
  How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
  Seem to me all the uses of this world![48]
  Fye on't! O fye! 'tis an unweeded garden,
  That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
  Possess it merely.[49] That it should come to this!
  But two months dead!--nay, not so much, not two:
  So excellent a king; that was, to this,
  Hyperion to a satyr:[50] so loving to my mother,
  That he might not beteem[51] the winds of heaven
  Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
  Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
  As if increase of appetite had grown
  By what it fed on: And yet, within a month,--
  Let me not think on't,--Frailty, thy name is Woman!--
  A little month; or ere those shoes were old
  With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
  Like Niobe, all tears;--she married with my uncle,
  My father's brother; but no more like my father
  Than I to Hercules.
  It is not, nor it cannot come to, good:
  But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
