In accordance with his promise, Benedick went to seek Claudio. He
presently found him with Don Pedro. The two gentlemen had just had a
painful interview with Leonato, who had indignantly reproached them
for their behaviour. They felt anything but happy, although they
persisted in thinking that they were quite justified in acting as they
had done. However, at the sight of Benedick their spirits rallied,
and they tried to assume their usual teasing vein of raillery. But
Benedick was in no jesting humour. With cold self-possession he
delivered his challenge to Claudio, and then he took a dignified leave
of the Prince of Arragon.
