67. _Why, how now, Juliet!_ Mrs. Jameson remarks: "In the dialogue
between Juliet and her parents, and in the scenes with the Nurse, we
seem to have before us the whole of her previous education and habits:
we see her, on the one hand, kept in severe subjection by her austere
parents; and, on the other, fondled and spoiled by a foolish old
nurse--a situation perfectly accordant with the manners of the time.
Then Lady Capulet comes sweeping by with her train of velvet, her black
hood, her fan, and rosary--the very beau-ideal of a proud Italian matron
of the fifteenth century, whose offer to poison Romeo, in revenge for
the death of Tybalt, stamps her with one very characteristic trait of
the age and the country. Yet she loves her daughter, and there is a
touch of remorseful tenderness in her lamentations over her, which adds
to our impression of the timid softness of Juliet and the harsh
subjection in which she has been kept."
