Travelling by sea on one occasion, they met with a dangerous
adventure, for near the coast of Illyria their ship was wrecked, and
though both managed to get safely to land, each feared the other had
perished. The captain of the ship, who was saved in the same boat with
Viola, kindly befriended her. It happened he knew that country well,
for he was born and bred there, and had only left it a month before.
He told Viola that it was governed by a Duke, noble in nature as in
name, and that this Duke was in love with a fair lady called Olivia.
The father and brother of the lady, however, had both died within the
last year, and the Countess Olivia out of love for them and grief for
their loss had shut herself up in seclusion ever since, and refused to
see anyone.
