KING.
Know you not
How your state stands i' th' world, with the whole world?
Your enemies are many, and not small; their practices
Must bear the same proportion; and not ever
The justice and the truth o' the question carries
The due o' the verdict with it.  At what ease
Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
To swear against you?  Such things have been done.
You are potently oppos'd, and with a malice
Of as great size.  Ween you of better luck,
I mean, in perjur'd witness, than your Master,
Whose minister you are, whiles here He liv'd
Upon this naughty earth?  Go to, go to!
You take a precipice for no leap of danger,
And woo your own destruction.
