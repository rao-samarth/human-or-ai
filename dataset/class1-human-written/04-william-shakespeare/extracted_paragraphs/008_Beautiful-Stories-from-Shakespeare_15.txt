There was living in Venice at this time a rich money-lender, named
Shylock. Antonio despised and disliked this man very much, and treated
him with the greatest harshness and scorn. He would thrust him, like a
cur, over his threshold, and would even spit on him. Shylock submitted
to all these indignities with a patient shrug; but deep in his heart he
cherished a desire for revenge on the rich, smug merchant. For Antonio
both hurt his pride and injured his business. “But for him,” thought
Shylock, “I should be richer by half a million ducats. On the market
place, and wherever he can, he denounces the rate of interest I charge,
and--worse than that--he lends out money freely.”
