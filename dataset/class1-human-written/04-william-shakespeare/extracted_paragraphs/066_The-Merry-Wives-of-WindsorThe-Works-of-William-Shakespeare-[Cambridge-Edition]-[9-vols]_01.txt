_Mrs Ford._ We burn daylight:--here, read, read; perceive
how I might be knighted. I shall think the worse of
fat men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of             50
men’s liking: and yet he would not swear; praised women’s
modesty; and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof
to all uncomeliness, that I would have sworn his disposition
would have gone to the truth of his words; but they do no
more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth              55
Psalm to the tune of ‘Green Sleeves.’ What tempest, I
trow, threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his
belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged on
him? I think the best way were to entertain him with
hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own       60
grease. Did you ever hear the like?
