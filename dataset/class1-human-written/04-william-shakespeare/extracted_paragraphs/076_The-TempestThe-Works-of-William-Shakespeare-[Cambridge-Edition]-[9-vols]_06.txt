Early editions:
  Rowe 1709
  Pope 1715
    “Pope was the first to indicate the _place_ of each new scene;
    as, for instance, _Tempest_, I. 1. ‘On a ship at sea.’ He also
    subdivided the scenes as given by the Folios and Rowe, making
    a fresh scene whenever a new character entered--an arrangement
    followed by Hanmer, Warburton, and Johnson. For convenience of
    reference to these editions, we have always recorded the
    commencement of Pope’s scenes.”
