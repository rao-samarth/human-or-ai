Romantic fiction was born for modern Europe on Italian soil.
Boccaccio of fourteenth-century Florence and Boccaccio’s long line
of disciples--Bandello of Milan, Giraldi Cinthio of Ferrara, and
many writers of less familiar name of the sixteenth century--had for
generations before Shakespeare’s epoch furnished not only Italy,
but all the Western countries of Europe with their chief recreative
literature in prose. The Italian novels were through the second half
of the sixteenth century constantly translated into English and
French, and it was to those English or French translations of the
Italian romances that Shakespeare owed the main suggestion for all
the plots of his comedies (save _Love’s Labour’s Lost_) and for many
of those of his tragedies. Belleforest’s “Histoires Tragiques,” a
collection of French versions of the Italian stories of Bandello, was
very often in his hands. Novels by Bandello are the ultimate sources
of the stories of _Romeo and Juliet_, of _Much Ado about Nothing_,
and of _Twelfth Night_. _All’s Well that Ends Well_ and _Cymbeline_
largely rest on foundations laid by Boccaccio. The tales of _Othello_
and _Measure for Measure_ are traceable to Giraldi Cinthio.
