Close and constant study of the great plays of Shakespeare must
ultimately rouse in the student a more absorbing interest in their
characters than in their plots. That is the final effect of supreme
dramatic genius. But the full appreciation of Shakespeare’s sure
and illimitable insight into character can never be reached until
we have made ourselves thoroughly familiar with the plot in which
the character has its substantive being. It follows, therefore, that
if one would realise completely in due time the whole eminence of
Shakespeare’s dramatic achievement, one should be encouraged at the
outset to study closely the stories of the plays rather than the
characters apart from their settings. When the youthful mind has
grasped the manner and matter of the plots, it will in adult age be
in a far better position than it could be otherwise to comprehend all
the excellences, all the subtleties of the characters. Only when plot
and character have received equally full attention will Shakespeare
stand revealed to the mature student in his manifold glory.
