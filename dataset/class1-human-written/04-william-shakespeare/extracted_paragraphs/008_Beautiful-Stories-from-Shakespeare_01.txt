Shakespeare died at Stratford on the 23rd of April, 1616. His father had
died before him, in 1602, and his mother in 1608. His wife survived
him till August, 1623. His so Hamnet died in 1596 at the age of eleven
years. His two daughters survived him, the eldest of whom, Susanna, had,
in 1607, married a physician of Stratford, Dr. Hall. The only issue of
this marriage, a daughter named Elizabeth, born in 1608, married first
Thomas Nasbe, and afterwards Sir John Barnard, but left no children by
either marriage. Shakespeare's younger daughter, Judith, on the 10th of
February, 1616, married a Stratford gentleman named Thomas Quincy, by
whom she had three sons, all of whom died, however, without issue. There
are thus no direct descendants of Shakespeare.
