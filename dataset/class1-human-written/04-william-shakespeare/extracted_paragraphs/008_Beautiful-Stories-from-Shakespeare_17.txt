So Rosalind set out to seek her father, the banished Duke, in the Forest
of Arden. Celia loved her too much to let her go alone, and as it was
rather a dangerous journey, Rosalind, being the taller, dressed up as
a young countryman, and her cousin as a country girl, and Rosalind said
that she would be called Ganymede, and Celia, Aliena. They were very
tired when at last they came to the Forest of Arden, and as they were
sitting on the grass a countryman passed that way, and Ganymede
asked him if he could get them food. He did so, and told them that
a shepherd's flocks and house were to be sold. They bought these and
settled down as shepherd and shepherdess in the forest.
