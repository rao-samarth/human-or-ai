_Ford._ What a damned epicurian is this?
My wife hath sent for him, the plot is laid:
_Page_ is an Asse, a foole. A secure Asse,                         155
Ile sooner trust an Irishman with my
Aquauita bottle, Sir _Hu_ our parson with my cheese,
A theefe to walke my ambling gelding, then my wife
With her selfe: then she plots, then she ruminates,
And what she thinkes in her hart she may effect,                   160
Sheele breake her hart but she will effect it.
God be praised, God be praised for my iealousie:
Well Ile go preuent him, the time drawes on,
Better an houre too soone, then a minit too late,
Gods my life cuckold, cuckold.                                     165
