116. _Do not swear._ Coleridge remarks here: "With love, pure love,
there is always an anxiety for the safety of the object, a
disinterestedness by which it is distinguished from the counterfeits of
its name. Compare this scene with the _Temp._ iii. 1. I do not know a
more wonderful instance of Shakespeare's mastery in playing a distinctly
rememberable variation on the same remembered air than in the
transporting love-confessions of Romeo and Juliet and Ferdinand and
Miranda. There seems more passion in the one, and more dignity in the
other; yet you feel that the sweet girlish lingering and busy movement
of Juliet, and the calmer and more maidenly fondness of Miranda, might
easily pass into each other."
