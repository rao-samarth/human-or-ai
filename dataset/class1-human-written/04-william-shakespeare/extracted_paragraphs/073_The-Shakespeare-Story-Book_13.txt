While they were still speaking, the Prince of Arragon, with his train
of noble gentlemen, arrived. Leonato welcomed them most warmly. Count
Claudio and Signor Benedick were old friends, and had previously
stayed at the Governor’s palace; indeed, before starting for the wars
Claudio had looked with more than an eye of favour on the gentle lady
Hero. As for Beatrice and Benedick, they pretended to have a great
aversion to each other, but, strange to say, instead of avoiding each
other’s society, they seemed to delight in seizing every opportunity
to plague and tease each other as much as possible.
