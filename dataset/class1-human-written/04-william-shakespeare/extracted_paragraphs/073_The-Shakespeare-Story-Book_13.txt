Macbeth had all his promised honours now--King, Cawdor,
Glamis--everything that the weird women had prophesied. But Macbeth
was not satisfied. There was one danger ever present in his path.
Banquo, his ancient comrade in arms, distrusted Macbeth; he suspected
him of playing most foully to win his present high honours. Macbeth,
for his part, feared Banquo, because of his noble nature, valour, and
wisdom in judgment. Outwardly he treated him with flattering civility,
but inwardly he was resolved to rid himself of this dangerous
companion. It was nothing to be King unless he could reign in safety.
Moreover, when the weird sisters gave the name of King to Macbeth,
they had, prophet-like, hailed Banquo father to a line of Kings. They
placed a fruitless crown on Macbeth’s head, and a barren sceptre in
his grip, if no son of his succeeded. If this were so, it was for
Banquo’s children he had defiled his mind and murdered the good King
Duncan--only for them! Macbeth resolved to go a step further in the
path of crime, and to kill both Banquo and his young son Fleance.
