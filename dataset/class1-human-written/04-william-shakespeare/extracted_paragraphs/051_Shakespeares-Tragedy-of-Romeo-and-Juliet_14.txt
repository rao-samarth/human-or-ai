234. _Is it more sin_, etc. Mrs. Jameson remarks: "It appears to me an
admirable touch of nature, considering the master-passion which, at this
moment, rules in Juliet's soul, that she is as much shocked by the
nurse's dispraise of her lover as by her wicked, time-serving advice.
This scene is the crisis in the character; and henceforth we see Juliet
assume a new aspect. The fond, impatient, timid girl puts on the wife
and the woman: she has learned heroism from suffering, and subtlety from
oppression. It is idle to criticise her dissembling submission to her
father and mother; a higher duty has taken place of that which she owed
to them; a more sacred tie has severed all others. Her parents are
pictured as they are, that no feeling for them may interfere in the
slightest degree with our sympathy for the lovers. In the mind of Juliet
there is no struggle between her filial and her conjugal duties, and
there ought to be none."
