There are local associations connected with Stratford which could not
be without their influence in the formation of young Shakespeare's mind.
Within the range of such a boy's curiosity were the fine old historic
towns of Warwick and Coventry, the sumptuous palace of Kenilworth, the
grand monastic remains of Evesham. His own Avon abounded with spots of
singular beauty, quiet hamlets, solitary woods. Nor was Stratford shut
out from the general world, as many country towns are. It was a great
highway, and dealers with every variety of merchandise resorted to its
markets. The eyes of the poet dramatist must always have been open for
observation. But nothing is known positively of Shakespeare from his
birth to his marriage to Anne Hathaway in 1582, and from that date
nothing but the birth of three children until we find him an actor in
London about 1589.
