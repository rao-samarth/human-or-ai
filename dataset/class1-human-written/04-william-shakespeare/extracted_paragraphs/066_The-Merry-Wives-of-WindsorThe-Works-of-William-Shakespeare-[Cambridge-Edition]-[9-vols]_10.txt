_Ford._ Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do
I sleep? Master Ford, awake! awake, Master Ford! there’s
a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford. This ’tis to           125
be married! this ’tis to have linen and buck-baskets!
Well, I will proclaim myself what I am: I will now take
the lecher; he is at my house; he cannot ’scape me; ’tis
impossible he should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny
purse, nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that guides      130
him should aid him, I will search impossible places.
Though what I am I cannot avoid, yet to be what I would
not shall not make me tame: if I have horns to make
one mad, let the proverb go with me,--I’ll be horn-mad.
    [_Exit._
