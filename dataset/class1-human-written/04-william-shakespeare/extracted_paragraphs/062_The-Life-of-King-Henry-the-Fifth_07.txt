God pless your Majesty!
  KING HENRY. How now, Fluellen! Cam'st thou from the bridge?
  FLUELLEN. Ay, so please your Majesty. The Duke of Exeter has
very
    gallantly maintain'd the pridge; the French is gone off, look
    you, and there is gallant and most prave passages. Marry, th'
    athversary was have possession of the pridge; but he is
enforced
    to retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge; I
can
    tell your Majesty the Duke is a prave man.
  KING HENRY. What men have you lost, Fluellen!
  FLUELLEN. The perdition of th' athversary hath been very great,
    reasonable great; marry, for my part, I think the Duke hath
lost
    never a man, but one that is like to be executed for robbing
a
    church- one Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man; his face
is
    all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o' fire; and
his
    lips blows at his nose, and it is like a coal of fire,
sometimes
    plue and sometimes red; but his nose is executed and his
fire's
    out.
  KING HENRY. We would have all such offenders so cut off. And we
    give express charge that in our marches through the country
there
    be nothing compell'd from the villages, nothing taken but
paid
    for, none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful
    language; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the
    gentler gamester is the soonest winner.
