But alas, poor lady, on the road to Milford Haven a terrible awakening
awaited her. Pisanio showed her the letter he had received from
Leonatus, and there she read of the crime of which he accused her,
and that Pisanio had orders to put her to death. Knowing herself
blameless, Imogen was nearly killed by the cruel words, and in
heart-broken accents she begged Pisanio to strike at once, and obey
his master’s bidding. But Pisanio indignantly flung his sword away,
refusing to stain his hand with such a deed. He had only brought her
thus far, he said, to think out what was best to be done. His master
must certainly have been deceived; some villain, peculiarly skilful in
his art, had done this injury. Pisanio said he would give notice to
Leonatus that Imogen was dead, sending some token of the fact as he
had been commanded. Imogen would be missed at Court, and that would
confirm his words.
