All the Court ladies were devoted to their beloved Queen, and not one
of them but believed in her innocence, and was indignant at the cruel
way in which she was treated. But not contented with simply pitying
her, one of them, Paulina, wife of the lord Antigonus, determined to
make an effort to get justice done. She thought that perhaps at the
sight of the innocent little child, the King’s stubborn heart might
relent. Paulina was a woman of firm and dauntless character. She went
to the prison, calmly carried off the infant in the face of some
feeble objections from the gaoler, then, proceeding to the palace,
she insisted on making her way into the presence of the King. Leontes
ordered her to be removed, but the spirited lady drew herself up with
such an air of defiance that for a moment no man dared lay hands on
her.
