BARDOLPH. Well met, Corporal Nym.
  NYM. Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
  BARDOLPH. What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
  NYM. For my part, I care not; I say little, but when time shall
    serve, there shall be smiles- but that shall be as it may. I
dare
    not fight; but I will wink and hold out mine iron. It is a
simple
    one; but what though? It will toast cheese, and it will
endure
    cold as another man's sword will; and there's an end.
  BARDOLPH. I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and
we'll
    be all three sworn brothers to France. Let't be so, good
Corporal
    Nym.
  NYM. Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the certain of
it;
    and when I cannot live any longer, I will do as I may. That
is my
    rest, that is the rendezvous of it.
  BARDOLPH. It is certain, Corporal, that he is married to Nell
    Quickly; and certainly she did you wrong, for you were
    troth-plight to her.
  NYM. I cannot tell; things must be as they may. Men may sleep,
and
    they may have their throats about them at that time; and some
say
    knives have edges. It must be as it may; though patience be a
    tired mare, yet she will plod. There must be conclusions.
Well, I
    cannot tell.
