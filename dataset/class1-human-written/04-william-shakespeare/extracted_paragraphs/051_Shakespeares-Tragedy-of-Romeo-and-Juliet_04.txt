"At thone syde of her chayre, her lover Romeo:
  And on the other side there sat one cald Mercutio.
  A courtier that eche where was highly had in pryce:
  For he was coorteous of his speche, and pleasant of devise.
  Euen as a Lyon would emong the lambes be bolde:
  Such was emong the bashfull maydes, Mercutio to beholde.
  With frendly gripe he ceasd [seized] fayre Juliets snowish hand:
  A gyft he had that nature gaue him in his swathing band.
  That frosen mountayne yse was neuer halfe so cold
  As were his handes, though nere so neer the fire he dyd them holde."
