"Receiue this vyoll small and keepe it as thine eye;
  And on the mariage day, before the sunne doe cleare the skye,
  Fill it with water full vp to the very brim,
  Then drinke it of, and thou shalt feele throughout eche vayne and lim
  A pleasant slumber slide, and quite dispred at length
  On all thy partes, from euery part reue all thy kindly strength;
  Withouten mouing thus thy ydle parts shall rest,
  No pulse shall goe, ne hart once beate within thy hollow brest,
  But thou shalt lye as she that dyeth in a traunce:
  Thy kinsmen and thy trusty frendes shall wayle the sodain chaunce;
  The corps then will they bring to graue in this church yarde,
  Where thy forefathers long agoe a costly tombe preparde,
  Both for them selfe and eke for those that should come after,[7]
  Both deepe it is, and long and large, where thou shalt rest, my daughter,
  Till I to Mantua sende for Romeus, thy knight;
  Out of the tombe both he and I will take thee forth that night."
