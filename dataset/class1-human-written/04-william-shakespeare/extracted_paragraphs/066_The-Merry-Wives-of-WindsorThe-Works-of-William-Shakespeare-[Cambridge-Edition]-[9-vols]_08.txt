_Fal._ Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I’ll endanger
my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more about                       15
me, I am no gibbet for you. Go. A short knife and a
throng!--To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go. You’ll not
bear a letter for me, you rogue! you stand upon your
honour! Why, thou unconfinable baseness, it is as much as
I can do to keep the terms of my honour precise: I, I, I            20
myself sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand,
and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to shuffle,
to hedge, and to lurch; and yet you, rogue, will ensconce
your rags, your cat-a-mountain looks, your red-lattice
phrases, and your bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of          25
your honour! You will not do it, you!
