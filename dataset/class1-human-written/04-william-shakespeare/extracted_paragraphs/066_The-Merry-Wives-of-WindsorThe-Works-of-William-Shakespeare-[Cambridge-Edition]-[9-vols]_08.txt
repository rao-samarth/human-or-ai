_Host._ Peace, I say! hear mine host of the Garter. Am
I politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel? Shall I lose my
doctor? no; he gives me the potions and the motions.
Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir Hugh? no; he              95
gives me the proverbs and the no-verbs. [Give me thy
hand, terrestrial; so.] Give me thy hand, celestial; so.
Boys of art, I have deceived you both; I have directed
you to wrong places: your hearts are mighty, your skins
are whole, and let burnt sack be the issue. Come, lay their        100
swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace; follow, follow,
follow.
