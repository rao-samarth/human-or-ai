_Host._ Peace _I_ say, heare mine host of the garter,               55
Am _I_ wise? am I polliticke? am _I_ Matchauil?
Shal _I_ lose my doctor? No, he giues me the motions
And the potions. Shal _I_ lose my parson, my sir _Hu_?
No, he giues me the prouerbes, and the nouerbes:
Giue me thy hand terestiall,                                        60
So giue me thy hand celestiall:
So boyes of art I haue deceiued you both,
I haue directed you to wrong places,
Your hearts are mightie, you skins are whole,
_Bardolfe_ laie their swords to pawne. Follow me lads               65
Of peace, follow me. Ha, ra, la. Follow.
