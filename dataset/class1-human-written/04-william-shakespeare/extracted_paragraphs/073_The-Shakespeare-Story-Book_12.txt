This nurse of Juliet’s was a talkative, easy-tempered old person,
very fond of her nursling--of whom she had had charge since she was a
baby--and good-natured after a fashion, but vulgar-minded, and very
selfish if anything came to cross her own convenience. Juliet had
coaxed her into sympathy about her present affairs, and Romeo, being a
very handsome, open-handed young gentleman, the nurse for the moment
was on their side, and consented to act as messenger between them. But
her own aches and pains were at all times more important to the old
woman than the concerns of anyone else; and even when returning from
her mission to settle the time of the marriage, she was more occupied
in recounting her own ailments than in relieving the anxiety of her
young mistress to hear news of Romeo.
