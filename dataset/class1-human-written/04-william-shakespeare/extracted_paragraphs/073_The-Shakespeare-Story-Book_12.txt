“Nay, if there were two such we should have none shortly, for one
would kill the other,” he said jeeringly. “Thou! Why, thou wilt
quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard
than thou hast; thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts,
having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. Thy head is
as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat. Thou hast quarrelled
with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy
dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a
tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, and with another for
tying his new shoes with old riband? And yet thou wilt tutor me from
quarrelling!”
