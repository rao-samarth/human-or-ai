_{F}or._ {I}s this a dreame? {I}s it a vision?
Maister _{F}ord_, maister _{F}ord_, awake maister _{F}ord_,         90
There is a hole made in your best coat M. _Ford_,
And a man shall not onely endure this wrong,
But shall stand vnder the taunt of names,
_Lucifer_ is a good name, _Barbason_ good: good
Diuels names: but cuckold, wittold, godeso                          95
The diuel himselfe hath not such a name:
And they may hang hats here, and napkins here
Vpon my homes: well {I}le home, _I_ ferit him,
And vnlesse the diuel himselfe should aide him.
Ile search vnpossible places: {I}le about it,                      100
Least I repent too late:
