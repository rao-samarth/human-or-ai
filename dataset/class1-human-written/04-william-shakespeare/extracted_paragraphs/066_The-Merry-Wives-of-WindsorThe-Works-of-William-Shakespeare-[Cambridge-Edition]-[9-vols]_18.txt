_Ford._ Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath                 25
he any thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.
Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as easy as a
cannon will shoot point-blank twelve score. He pieces out
his wife’s inclination; he gives her folly motion and advantage:
and now she’s going to my wife, and Falstaff’s boy                  30
with her. A man may hear this shower sing in the wind.
And Falstaff’s boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;
and our revolted wives share damnation together. Well; I
will take him, then torture my wife, pluck the borrowed
veil of modesty from the so seeming Mistress Page, divulge          35
Page himself for a secure and wilful Actæon; and to these
violent proceedings all my neighbours shall cry aim. [_Clock
heard._] The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance
bids me search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be rather
praised for this than mocked; for it is as positive as the          40
earth is firm that Falstaff is there: I will go.
