[The vision.  Enter, solemnly tripping one after another, six
personages, clad in white robes, wearing on their heads garlands
of bays, and golden vizards on their faces; branches of bays or
palm in their hands. They first congee unto her, then dance; and,
at certain changes, the first two hold a spare garland over her
head; at which the other four make reverent curtsies. Then the
two that held the garland deliver the same to the other next
two, who observe the same order in their changes, and holding
the garland over her head; which done, they deliver the same
garland to the last two, who likewise observe the same order;
at which, as it were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep
signs of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven:  and so
in their dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them. The
music continues.]
