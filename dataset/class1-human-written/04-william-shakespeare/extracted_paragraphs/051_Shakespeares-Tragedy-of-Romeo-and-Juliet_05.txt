hawk. Dyce quotes Cotgrave, _Fr. Dict._: "Tiercelet. The Tassell or male
of any kind of Hawke, so tearmed, because he is, commonly, a third part
less than the female;" and Holmes, _Academy of Armory_: "_Tiercell_,
_Tercell_, or _Tassell_ is the general name for the Male of all large
Hawks." Malone says that the _tiercel-gentle_ was the species of hawk
appropriated to the prince, and thinks that on that account Juliet
applies it to Romeo. We find _tercel_ in _T. and C._ iii. 2. 56: "The

falconer's voice_. Cf. _T. of S._ iv. 1. 196:--
