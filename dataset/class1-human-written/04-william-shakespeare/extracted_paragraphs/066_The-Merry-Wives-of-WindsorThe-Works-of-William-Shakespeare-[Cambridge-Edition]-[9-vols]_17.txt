_Fal._ By the Lord a buck-basket, rammed me in
With foule shirts, stokins, greasie napkins,
That M. _Brooke_, there was a compound of the most                  65
Villanous smel, that euer offended nostrill.
Ile tell you M. _Brooke_, by the Lord for your sake
I suffered three egregious deaths: First to be
Crammed like a good bilbo, in the circomference
Of a pack, Hilt to point, heele to head: and then to                70
Be stewed in my owne grease like a Dutch dish:
A man of my kidney; by the Lord it was maruell I
Escaped suffication; and in the heat of all this,
To be throwne into Thames like a horshoo hot:
Maister _Brooke_, thinke of that hissing heate, Maister _Brooke_.   75
