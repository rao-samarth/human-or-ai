[Footnote I.31: _A little more than kin, and less than kind._]
    Dr. Johnson says that _kind_ is the Teutonic word for _child_.
    Hamlet, therefore, answers to the titles of _cousin_ and _son_,
    which the king had given him, that he was somewhat more than
    _cousin_, and less than _son_. Steevens remarks, that it seems to
    have been another proverbial phrase: "The nearer we are in blood,
    the further we must be from love; the greater the _kindred_ is,
    the less the _kindness_ must be." _Kin_ is still used in the
    Midland Counties for _cousin_, and _kind_ signifies _nature_.
    Hamlet may, therefore, mean that the relationship between them
    had become _unnatural_.]
