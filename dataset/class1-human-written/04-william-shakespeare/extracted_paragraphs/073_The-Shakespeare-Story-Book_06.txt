“And Benedick is not the least hopeful husband I know,” said the
Prince. “Thus far I can praise him: he is of noble race, of approved
valour, and of steadfast honesty. I will teach you how to humour your
cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick, and I, with the help
of Leonato and Claudio, will so practise on Benedick that, in spite
of his quick wit and fastidious temper, he shall fall in love with
Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer; his glory
shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods! Come with me, and I will
tell you my plan.”
