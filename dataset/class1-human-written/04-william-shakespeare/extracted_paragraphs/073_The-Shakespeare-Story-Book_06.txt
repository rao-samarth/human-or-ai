Not far from the forest was the house that had formerly belonged to
a good gentleman--Sir Rowland de Boys. Dying, Sir Rowland had left
all his possessions to his eldest son, Oliver, excepting one thousand
crowns, which was to go to the youngest son, Orlando. Sir Rowland,
however, had charged Oliver to bring up his two brothers carefully.
Oliver had sent the second son, Jaques, to school, where the boy did
well; but his youngest brother, Orlando, he kept at home, leaving
him utterly neglected and without any sort of training. Not only did
Oliver do nothing at all for his brother, but he even tried to take
away what advantages Orlando possessed by nature. He made him feed
with the servants, debarred him his place as brother, and in every
way possible seemed to aim at unfitting him for his position as a
gentleman.
