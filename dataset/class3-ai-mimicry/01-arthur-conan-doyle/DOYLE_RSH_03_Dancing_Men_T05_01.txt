I confess, the entire affair struck me as a rather tedious demonstration of a most elementary principle. The man—a hulking carter named Hobbs, whose chief contributions to our little town were noise and obstruction—had cornered the new solicitor by the parish hall, believing, as his sort always do, that a menacing glower and a fist the size of a ham could unravel the complexities of a legal writ. From my vantage, I watched the solicitor, a pale and scholarly fellow, listen with unnerving patience to the brute’s catalogue of threats. Hobbs bellowed about ruination and what he would do if the injunction were not withdrawn forthwith. The solicitor simply waited for him to pause for breath and then, in a voice of quiet reason, pointed out a single, overlooked codicil in the town charter—a point of law so simple, yet so absolute, that it rendered the carter's entire position, and indeed his very presence, a complete absurdity. The great man stood there, his mouth agape, utterly shipwrecked upon a reef of pure logic. He had brought a cudgel to a battle of wits, and the result was, as it must ever be, a foregone conclusion.
