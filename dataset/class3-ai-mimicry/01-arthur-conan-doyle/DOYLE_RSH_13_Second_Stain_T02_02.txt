My cousin Agatha was mauling a sonata upon the pianoforte, whilst my uncle dozed fitfully by the fire, his snores a most unmusical counterpoint. Their placid world, governed by the simple maxims of the nursery, seemed a universe removed from the perplexing business which now consumed me. I had given my word to a man—a solemn vow, mind you, upon which a gentleman’s very character is built—and yet, here was I, charged with an undertaking for the Crown which demanded, as its very first step, the utter shattering of that promise. I watched the firelight dance upon their untroubled faces and felt a pang, not of guilt, but of a strange and lonely pity for their innocence. They could never comprehend that certain imperatives of state must, for the preservation of all they hold dear, grind a man’s private scruples into so much necessary dust; indeed, the true patriot is he who can sacrifice not only his life for his country, but that which he holds infinitely more dear.
