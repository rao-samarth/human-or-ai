You ask me, my dear friend, why I concern myself with the affair of the Cheapside moneylender when the police have already closed their books upon the matter. It is precisely because the official channels are blind to the truest form of retribution. Scotland Yard sees only a man who fell from a bridge—an unfortunate accident, they call it, or perhaps a fit of despair. Yet I see a web, intricate and dark, spun by a creature who drove a dozen good families to ruin, always operating within the very letter of the statute, whilst violating every principle of human decency. The law could not touch him, for his contracts were ironclad and his methods beyond reproach. Therefore, when fate, or perhaps a hand guided by a desperate victim, intervened on that foggy night, I cannot find it in my heart to call it a crime. I call it an equilibrium, a final, terrible accounting that the Old Bailey could never provide.
