You cite his imperturbable composure as the very hallmark of a hardened conscience, and yet, it is precisely there that you misread the signs. Consider, my dear fellow, that a man of genuine innocence, or indeed of true villainous mettle, would exhibit some natural variance—a flicker of indignation, a moment of unguarded ease. Observe Mr. Albright, however; his stillness is absolute, his smile a fixture of painted porcelain. It is not composure; it is a rigid, desperate façade. The immense strain of such a masquerade is visible, I assure you, in the most trifling of details. The faint tremor in the muscle of his jaw, the whitening of his knuckles as he clasps his brandy-glass—these are not the indices of a calculating mind. No, they are the betrayals of a terrified creature attempting to hold a mask in place, a mask which, I suspect, is perilously close to shattering.
