The clock tower, a recent and much-lauded addition to the town square, had regulated the lives of its inhabitants with a most commendable precision. Its chimes, once a novelty, were now as ingrained in the daily round as the rising of the sun; the shopkeeper set his shutters by them, the vicar timed his sermons, and the children knew that the final peal of five o’clock meant a swift return homeward. Yet, for all its admirable punctuality, there was a certain metallic quality to its tone—a jarring note, almost imperceptible, that a more sensitive ear might have found disquieting. The townsfolk, however, in their simple trust and admiration for this handsome civic gift, paid it no mind. They saw only the gilded hands and the Roman numerals, a symbol of order and progress, and remained blissfully unaware that the very mechanism which marked their peaceful hours was, with each deliberate tick, winding a spring of a far more sinister and final nature.
