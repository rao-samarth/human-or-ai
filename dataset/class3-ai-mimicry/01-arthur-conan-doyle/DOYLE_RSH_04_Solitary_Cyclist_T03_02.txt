Observe this human river, this endless torrent of faces flooding the Strand; one might mistake it for a thousand disconnected currents, each man pursuing his own petty advantage. Yet this is a profound error. You see, the most potent force for uniting men who would otherwise be at one another’s throats is not ideology, nor is it loyalty—it is the uncomplicated lust for wealth. This single, vulgar appetite is a universal language, understood by the highest and the lowest alike. It requires no elaborate philosophy; hence, a cabal of otherwise incompatible scoundrels may be formed in an instant upon the mere whisper of a fortune to be had. Their individual desires coalesce, you see, forming a single, formidable engine of collusion, for there is no pact more swiftly sealed or more jealously guarded than one founded upon the mutual promise of unearned gold.
