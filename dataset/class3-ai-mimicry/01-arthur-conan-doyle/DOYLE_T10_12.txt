Mark how my uncle now addresses young Thomas; he does not confront the boy directly—that would be a clumsy affair, certain to provoke a scene amongst the ladies. Instead, he builds a cage of established facts, each one a gleaming, unassailable bar. He mentions the lad’s unfortunate investment in the Peruvian venture, a matter of public record, and then, with a sigh of paternal sorrow, alludes to his recent and most 'ardent' enthusiasms. He offers no falsehoods, you comprehend; not a single one! He merely selects his truths with the care of a master mason, omitting any that would not serve the structure he wishes to build in the minds of all present. And what is that structure? Why, a conviction, as firm as any prison wall, that the boy's judgment is simply not to be trusted in the matter of the inheritance. It is a masterful demonstration, not of dishonesty, but of a most refined and practical artistry in the arrangement of what is known.
