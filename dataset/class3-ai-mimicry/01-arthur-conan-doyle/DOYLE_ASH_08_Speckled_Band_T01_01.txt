The dismissal of Mr. Abernathy was, to be sure, a most shocking affair, and yet for those of us who had long laboured under the shadow of his insatiable acquisitiveness, it felt as though a great and stifling weight had been lifted from the very rafters of the firm. His every calculation, his every sharp-edged bargain, had been directed towards the singular end of his own enrichment—a pursuit so blinding that he failed to perceive the brittle foundations upon which he built his precarious empire. Now, with his grand office standing empty and the accounts at last laid bare for honest review, a palpable sense of renewed purpose circulates amongst the junior partners. The air, once thick with suspicion and the quiet resentment of stifled careers, has cleared entirely; what was once a labyrinth of his design is now an open field, and we find, to our collective relief, that the sun shines quite brightly upon it.
