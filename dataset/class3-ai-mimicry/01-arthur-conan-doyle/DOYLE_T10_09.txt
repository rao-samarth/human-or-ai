My dear fellow, I have been sitting here in the quietude of my country retreat, the morning papers lying unheeded upon the breakfast table, and I find myself reflecting upon the extraordinary architecture of a public narrative. Consider the latest pronouncements from town regarding the railway dispute. The official reports detail, with meticulous accuracy, the schedules disrupted and the cargo delayed—facts as solid as the very iron of the tracks. Yet where is the mention of the gruelling hours or the paltry compensation that spurred the men to their protest? There is none. It is a most ingenious form of persuasion, you see; one does not need to invent falsehoods when the simple, judicious omission of a vital truth can so effectively guide a man’s reason. By presenting an incomplete picture as the whole, they construct a villain from a victim, leaving the public to pass judgement upon a spectre of their own careful making.
