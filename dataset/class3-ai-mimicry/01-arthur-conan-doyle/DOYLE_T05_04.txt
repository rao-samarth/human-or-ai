Every step along the cobbled lane of Little Tilbury was a fresh reminder of the man I was supposed to be. The vicarage, with its solemn grey stones, stood as a monument to my sworn obligations, and the cheerful greetings from the townsfolk, each offered in good faith, were but individual links in a chain I had forged myself. To them, I was a pillar of the community, a man whose word was his bond; a promise made was a life defined. Yet, what did they know of the frantic rebellion in my own breast, of the face that haunted my waking hours and lent a feverish quality to my dreams? To abandon my station now would be an act of profound and selfish treason, not only to my betrothed but to the very fabric of this life I had so carefully constructed. It was a simple, brutal calculus of the heart: one man’s happiness weighed against the honour of a dozen souls. There could be, alas, only one resolution.
