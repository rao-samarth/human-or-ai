From my study window, I observed the slow, patient turning of the seasons across the downs, a grand and immutable process which puts the frantic ambitions of mankind into their proper, insignificant perspective. It is a strange and lamentable fact that a man, born to such a noble heritage, might be so entirely hollowed out by the simple desire for wealth. What manner of soul is it that can measure the security of his own people against a stack of foreign banknotes? It is a contemptible form of moral arithmetic, by which allegiance, honour, and the trust of a nation are all weighed upon the scales and found wanting against a coffer of gold. He does not conspire for a grand principle or a mistaken ideology, which might at least possess a certain tragic dignity; no, he trades in secrets as a grocer trades in tea, and sells the very foundations of his fatherland for a price that would seem paltry to any but the most desperately avaricious of minds.
