You ask, my dear fellow, how an entire crowd can be so readily swayed by the most patent absurdities. It is, I confess, a study of some interest. The true artist in this dark trade rarely deals in the clumsy outright falsehood; his method is infinitely more subtle and, I must say, more effective. He will present to his audience a selection of facts, each one in itself unimpeachable, and upon this solid-seeming foundation he will build his case. He points to the smoke from the northern mills, he notes the cost of a Sunday joint, he remarks upon a recent change in foreign policy—all are verities. And yet, by the simple omission of one or two trifling yet pivotal details, the entire complexion of the matter is altered, and a conclusion is reached that is as far from the genuine state of affairs as this grimy London pavement is from the sun. The great weapon is not the lie told, but the vital truth withheld.
