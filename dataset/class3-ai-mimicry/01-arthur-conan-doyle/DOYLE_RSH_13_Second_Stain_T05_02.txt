Mr. Elias Thorne, chief accountant for the firm of March & Sons, perceived his position with a clarity as cold and sharp as the January air. For three decades his name had been a byword for integrity, a Gibraltar of fiscal rectitude; yet, a single, foolish miscalculation, an error of judgement now compounded by a week of frantic and futile efforts to conceal it, threatened to bring the entire edifice of his life crashing down. The auditors were to arrive upon the morrow. Henceforth, he saw but one path, a dreadful avenue of escape which his mind, hitherto a stranger to such criminal fancies, now embraced with the fervour of a drowning man clutching at a serpent. With a trembling hand, he struck a lucifer match, its small flame casting a hellish glow upon the damning ledger—a beacon, he prayed, that would consume his shame and leave behind naught but the clean, sterile ash of a tragic accident. The act was monstrous, a violation of all he held dear, but what was the soul of one man against the preservation of a lifetime’s honour?
