It is a singular and lamentable fact of human nature that the most perilous of quarrels are often not those born of avarice or jealousy, but of a professional pride which has been grievously wounded. I recall the matter of the two chief clerks, men who had for years shared the same dusty office, their days governed by the quiet scratch of pen upon parchment. Their dispute, which culminated in so dreadful a fashion, arose from no grand affair of finance, but from a point of honour concerning the drafting of a legal instrument. The elder man, whose entire reputation was built upon his meticulous and unwavering precision, perceived in his colleague’s innovation not a clever shortcut, but a profound moral corruption of their craft. It was this intense, almost fanatical, devotion to his work which, when met with a younger man’s dismissive smile, transformed a heavy brass ruler from a tool of order into an agent of the most brutal and final chaos. Hence, we may observe how a virtue, when carried to its extreme, may become a far more potent and destructive force than any simple vice.
