I saw the look on his face—a vile, knowing smirk—as he spoke to her, and whilst his words were cloaked in a thin veneer of civility, their true and foul meaning was as plain as day. What was I to do? To stand by and permit such an impertinence to pass unchallenged would have been an abdication of my own honour, a stain upon the very principles by which we live. Hence, I waited for him outside the establishment. No scene was made, I assure you; it was a private matter, settled swiftly in the fog with the butt of my revolver—a sharp rap to the temple, just enough to ensure the lesson was properly learned. Some might call it a rash or even a barbarous act, but when a lady's dignity is so casually assaulted, the response cannot be measured or mild; it must be an immediate and definitive statement, a piece of practical logic which the offender will not soon forget.
