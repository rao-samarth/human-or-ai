It is a perpetual source of amusement to me how the average man is utterly taken in by a rustic scene. He gazes upon a thatched cottage, wreathed in climbing roses, and at once imagines a life of simple virtue and wholesome, country-baked bread. What he fails to perceive, of course, is that the very quaintness he so admires is a master-stroke of concealment; the charmingly uneven flagstones are perfectly designed to trip an unwary constable in the dark, and the thick, ancient walls muffle a great deal more than the winter winds. The placid old gentleman who tends his garden with such apparent devotion? A more accomplished forger has not seen the inside of a prison in a generation, a fact to which his neighbours, in their blissful ignorance, remain entirely oblivious. They praise his horticultural skill, little knowing that the same delicate hand that coaxes a bloom is equally adept at reproducing the precise flourish upon a bank-note. Indeed, the countryside offers a tranquility of a most peculiar and profitable kind.
