My uncle, Sir Alistair, had always held that certain animosities, once forged in the crucible of public life, were a legacy as binding as any coat of arms. I saw the truth of this severe philosophy tonight, as young Harrington was announced—the son, as it happened, of the very minister whose perfidious manoeuvres had cost my uncle his career and his good name some thirty years prior. The boy, entirely unwitting, stood upon the threshold with a pleasant and open countenance, whilst across the dining table, I observed a shadow pass over Sir Alistair’s features, a hardening of the jaw that I knew all too well. It was within his power, with a single, well-placed word to a certain government whip, to bring about the young man’s immediate professional ruination. Here, then, was the question laid bare: would the sins of the father be visited upon the son, or could mercy, at long last, extinguish a grievance that had smouldered for decades? His hand, I noted, trembled ever so slightly as he reached for his wine.
