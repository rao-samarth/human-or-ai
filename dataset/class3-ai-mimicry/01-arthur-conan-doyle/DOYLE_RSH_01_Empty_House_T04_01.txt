You must forgive my seeming preoccupation, my dear Alistair, but you see the game enters its final, and most fascinating, stage. For two decades, a blackguard of the most singular cunning has paraded as a man of some repute, whilst the memory of his crime faded, as he no doubt hoped, into the mists of history. He grew bold, you understand, believing the affair long forgotten by all save himself. What a fatal miscalculation! We have merely allowed him a sufficient length of rope—a very great length indeed—and have watched him weave it into a snare of his own making. Now, with this final piece of intelligence secured from the docks but an hour ago, the time for observation is quite past. Pray finish your port, for tonight we shall have the profound satisfaction of pulling that rope taut at last.
