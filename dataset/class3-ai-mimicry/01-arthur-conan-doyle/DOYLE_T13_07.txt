Mr. Pringle had, for the better part of an hour, been holding forth upon the infallibility of his new security system, a contrivance of such fiendish complexity that he spoke of it as one might a beloved, if rather dangerous, child. He paced before the hearth, outlining with grandiloquent gestures the series of interlocking bolts and electrical wires which, he assured me, rendered his study more impregnable than the Bank of England itself. It was upon the triumphant conclusion of his lecture that I felt compelled to ask a simple question: had he perchance accounted for the large, unsecured coal-chute which opened directly beneath his window? A most singular silence descended. The man’s entire posture, so recently a monument to self-congratulation, seemed to deflate upon the instant; his face, a moment before flushed with victory, took on the pallid hue of one who has just swallowed a particularly unpalatable truth. It was a dreadful, yet instructive, spectacle.
