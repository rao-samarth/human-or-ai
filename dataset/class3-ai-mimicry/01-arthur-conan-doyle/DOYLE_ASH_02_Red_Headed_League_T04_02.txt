The drawing-room at Atherley Grange rang with a boisterous cheerfulness, a quality entirely absent from the countenance of our host’s brother, Mr. Finch. He sat somewhat apart from the gaiety, his thin frame swallowed by a wing-backed chair, yet his eyes darted about with a most singular and predatory intensity. What drew my attention, however, was not his nervous disposition but the cufflink which glittered upon his right wrist—a single, magnificent sapphire set in platinum, a bauble more suited to a prince than to a man whose financial embarrassments were common gossip. He would touch it, ever and again, with the fingers of his left hand, a gesture that was less one of pride and more, I fancied, of a man ensuring a priceless and precarious anchor had not slipped its mooring. The family saw only their quiet, melancholic relation; they failed to perceive the glaring inconsistency, the unspoken confession that winked from his sleeve with every shift of the firelight.
