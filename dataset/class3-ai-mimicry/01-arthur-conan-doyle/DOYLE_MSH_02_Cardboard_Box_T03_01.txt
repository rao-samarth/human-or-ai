The average man, you see, is quite incapable of true observation; he looks, but he does not see, and thus the most vital of clues are to him but meaningless trifles. In a great metropolis, a thousand such details may be lost in the general clamour, but here, in the quietude of a provincial town, they stand out with a singular clarity. The constable will mark the overturned furniture and the forced lock, for these are the broad strokes of the affair. Yet he will miss the significance of the faint scuff upon the wainscot, or the precise nature of the mud clinging to the rug—details which, when placed in their correct sequence, form a chain of inference as strong as any iron fetter. The entire business of arriving at the truth is, in essence, an exercise in distinguishing the crucial from the merely incidental, for a crime is but a story told backwards, and its beginning is found in the smallest of its endings.
