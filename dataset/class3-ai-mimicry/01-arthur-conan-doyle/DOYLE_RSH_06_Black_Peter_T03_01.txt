I observed with a certain detached interest the escalating quarrel between Messrs. Albright and Finch over the new shipping contract. Neither man, I must remark, was in any want of professional success; on the contrary, their ledgers were in a most healthy state. Yet the prospect of this one additional prize, this trifling increase in their personal standing, was sufficient to turn a professional rivalry into a most unseemly and brutish affair. It is a singular, yet recurring, feature of our human condition that the most savage of altercations spring not from the empty belly of the starving man, but from the covetous heart of the man who already has a sufficiency. One perceives, in such petty office dramas, the very same base impulse that has toppled empires and laid waste to nations—the insatiable hunger for that which is not one's own, a motive more potent and more destructive than any mere passion or political creed.
