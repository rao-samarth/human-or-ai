The portly Inspector, a man whose entire philosophy of justice was contained within the truncheon at his belt, was closing upon the wretched pamphleteer with a look of grim satisfaction. To challenge him directly would have been an exercise in futility, inviting only a cudgel blow for my troubles whilst doing the poor fellow no service whatsoever. Yet, to abandon the man, whose only crime was an unpopular opinion, to the brutalities of the local gaol struck me as an intolerable act of cowardice. My gaze swept the chaotic press of Cheapside, the clatter of iron-shod wheels upon the cobbles, the throng of merchants and clerks. It was then I observed it: a drayman, red-faced and furious, arguing with a vendor over the price of a crate of fish. A single, well-projected cry of “Thief! He has my purse!” was all that was required. The resulting confusion—a maelstrom of accusation and public alarm directed at an innocent man—was a regrettable, indeed a distasteful, manoeuvre, but it bought the necessary seconds for the true quarry to melt back into the city’s indifferent embrace.
