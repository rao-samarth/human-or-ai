Mr. Abernathy stood before the senior partner's desk, the heavy oak a veritable bar of judgment between them. On its polished surface lay the ledger, opened to the offending entry, and beside it, the very quill he himself had mended but a week prior. The evidence was, to all appearances, irrefutable; the figures altered, the signature a passable imitation of his own hand, and the missing funds a matter of cold, hard fact. Mr. Croft, a man whose face seemed carved from granite, gestured towards the book. "Abernathy," he said, his voice low and devoid of passion, "the new lad, Millington, is a flighty sort. A word from you concerning his recent debts, a suggestion of his proximity to this ledger, might… clarify matters for the board." The offer hung in the air, a lifeline of perfidy. To condemn the boy, a foolish but fundamentally decent youth, would be a simple matter. Yet, as Abernathy met the partner's cold, expectant gaze, he felt a resolve harden within him. He would face the gallows of professional ruin before he would construct its scaffold for another.
