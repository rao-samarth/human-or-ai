It was a most singular case, the infatuation of Miss Elspeth Gable. For forty years she had been the very model of prudence in the small parish of Oakhaven, a woman whose judgment upon matters of finance or charity was held as sound as the vicar’s own. Yet, with the arrival of the roguish Mr. Finch—a man whose character was as transparently flawed as a cracked windowpane—all her famed reason seemed to have deserted her utterly. The townsfolk watched with a collective, sorrowful shake of the head as she attributed his indolence to a poetic temperament and his constant borrowing to the temporary embarrassments of a gentleman. They saw the calculating gleam in his eye when he spoke to her; she, however, saw only the devoted ardour she had spent a lifetime awaiting. It was a potent and pitiable demonstration of how a heart, long starved of companionship, will contrive to build a palace upon the most wretched of foundations, furnishing it with dreams and ignoring the evident rot in the timbers.
