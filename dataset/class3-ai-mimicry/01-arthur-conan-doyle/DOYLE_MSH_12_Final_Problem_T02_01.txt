It is a singular, and indeed a perilous, thing when two minds of the very first order are brought into direct and irresolvable opposition. The great, teeming thoroughfare below, with its endless stream of humanity, seemed but a sluggish river of common thought, whilst in this quiet room, two torrents of pure reason met headlong. Here was no vulgar squabble, but a silent and most formidable warfare waged not with steel, but with the cold, hard currency of fact and inference. Each possessed a faculty for analysis so acute that he could anticipate the other’s every logical step, tracing the faintest shadow of a premise to its ultimate and inevitable conclusion. The result, therefore, is seldom a simple victory; for where each deduction is perfectly met and every stratagem flawlessly countered, the contest becomes less a struggle for dominance and more a state of absolute, and altogether terrifying, equilibrium, a perfect and motionless balance of intellectual force.
