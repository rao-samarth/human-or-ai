One might suppose this pastoral tranquillity would soothe a troubled spirit, yet I find it only sharpens the memory of man’s inherent duplicity. It is a singular folly, this human insistence upon loyalty; one invests years in a fellowship, sharing confidences and breaking bread, only to discover the entire enterprise was built upon the shifting sands of another’s self-interest. The wound, you see, is not inflicted by the keen blade of an open enemy—for that, one is always prepared. No, the truly remarkable perfidy is that which is delivered with a familiar smile over a glass of sherry, the quiet chicanery of a man you would have trusted with your very life. To be astonished by such an event is, I have concluded, the ultimate mark of the amateur in the study of his fellow creatures. The sheep in these fields, at least, are honest in their simple appetites and make no pretence of a higher virtue.
