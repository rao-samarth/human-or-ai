Pray, do not stare so aghast, for your scruples, however noble, are a luxury we can ill afford in this desperate hour. The man we hunt is no brute, to be felled by a simple blow; he is a creature of shadow and whispers, and to fight him in the open is to invite our own immediate ruin. Consider the facts! He anticipates our every honest move, he has laid traps for every predictable path, and to walk upon them with truth as our banner is nothing short of suicide. No, we must present him with a phantom, a carefully constructed lie so convincing that he will turn all his formidable resources to combat it. While he grapples with this spectre of our own making, we—unseen and unheard—shall strike at his true foundation. It is a grim necessity, I concede, but in a war of wits, the most potent weapon is the one your enemy cannot possibly foresee.
