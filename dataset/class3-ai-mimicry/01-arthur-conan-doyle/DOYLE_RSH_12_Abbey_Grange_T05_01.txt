It is a peculiar custom in these rural backwaters, and one which I confess affords me a certain grim amusement. Here in Stokely, the local constabulary head, a man of immense self-regard named Finch, has dispensed with the tedious formalities of the judiciary altogether. Having apprehended some hapless poacher or petty thief, he proceeds to hold court in the public house as if it were the High Court itself. With a theatrical flourish that would shame a Drury Lane player, he lays out his ‘evidence’—a muddy footprint here, a carelessly dropped button there—and constructs a narrative of such unassailable certainty that the poor wretch is condemned before he has even finished his pint. The assembled farmers and merchants, their minds untroubled by any notion of presumption of innocence, nod along sagely. Finch examines, deduces, and convicts in a single breath; a most efficient system for a town that values swift conclusions far more than it values justice.
