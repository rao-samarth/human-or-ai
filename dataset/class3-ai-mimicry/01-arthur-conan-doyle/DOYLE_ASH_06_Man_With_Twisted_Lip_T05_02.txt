You would have found it a most singular study in contrasts here tonight, my dear fellow, and one that gives the lie to a great deal of fashionable nonsense. It is a common error to believe that a man’s character is reflected in the quality of his tweed, or that his intellect may be measured by the contents of his purse. Consider the violinist engaged for the evening’s diversion: a fellow with a frayed collar and the weary countenance of one for whom life has been a perpetual struggle. The gentry here perceive only the humble tradesman, a mere functionary to be paid and dismissed. And yet, when he puts his instrument to his chin, there emerges from that worn wooden box a passion and a formidable intelligence that not one of these chattering dandies could ever hope to possess. It is a sharp lesson, indeed; one that proves that the most brilliant jewels are often found not in the velvet-lined cases of the wealthy, but in the most unassuming of settings.
