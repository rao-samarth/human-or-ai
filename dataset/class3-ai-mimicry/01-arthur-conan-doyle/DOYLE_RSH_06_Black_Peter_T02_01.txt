You thought the matter concluded, did you not? That the miserable business in the colonies was a ghost to be laid to rest by two decades of respectable living? My dear sir, you cannot build a new life upon the foundations of an old crime; the structure is doomed from its very inception! Every sovereign you have earned, every ounce of prestige you have acquired, has been but a deferment against the inevitable calling-in of a debt. The past is not some ledger that can be conveniently balanced or burned; it is a living thing, a bloodhound that, once it has the scent, will never abandon the trail. It has followed you across oceans and through the years, and I must inform you now, with the utmost gravity, that its baying is at last upon your very doorstep! You are a man cornered by his own history, and there is no escape.
