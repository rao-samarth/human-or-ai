The hulking fellow who darkened the doorway of Mr. Abernathy’s modest bookshop was a man whose entire argument for existence seemed to rest upon the sheer mass of his fists. He spoke in a low rumble of “insurance” against unforeseen accidents, a crude euphemism which caused the old proprietor to pale visibly. From my corner, I observed the scoundrel, noting the predictable pattern of his threats; it was the work of a blunt instrument, and possessed not an ounce of cunning. Yet, what course was I to take? To summon the constable would invite future, and perhaps more final, retribution upon the kindly Abernathy, whilst to allow this base thuggery to prevail was an offence to reason itself. It was then I perceived a small detail upon the brute’s ill-fitting coat—a tailor’s mark from a shop in Northwood, a town some thirty miles distant. A simple question, delivered with calm assurance, as to why a man so concerned with local commerce would acquire his tailoring so very far afield, seemed to unnerve him completely. The entire edifice of his local authority, so carefully constructed upon fear, crumbled at the touch of one inconvenient fact.
