My uncle Balthazar, his waistcoat straining against the exertions of a truly formidable dinner, held forth upon the subject of colonial trade with the unshakeable certainty of a man who has never once had his opinions contradicted. “It is a simple equation,” he boomed, gesturing with a half-empty glass of port. “They possess the raw materials; we possess the industry. The matter admits of no further debate.” It was then that young Edward, my cousin from the country branch of the family, ventured a quiet interjection. “But surely, sir,” he began, his voice barely rising above the crackle of the fire, “if we impoverish the producer to such an extent, do we not also eliminate a potential customer for our own finished goods?” A most astute point, I thought, yet Balthazar merely scoffed, waving a dismissive hand. “Leave such matters to your elders, my boy. A fine brain is a splendid thing, no doubt, but it is of little practical use until it is weighted by a respectable balance at the bank.” Edward fell silent at once, a clear demonstration that a man’s logic, however sound, is often measured by the quality of his coat.
