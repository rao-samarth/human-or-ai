From the rattling confinement of my carriage, my eye was drawn to a peculiar juxtaposition upon the landscape. There, a gaunt skeleton of some ancient priory, its stone arches like the bleached ribs of a long-dead leviathan, stood in silent judgment of the brutish brick factory which had sprung up in its very shadow. One might be tempted, I suppose, to see progress in such a scene, yet I perceived only a fleeting and impertinent masquerade. The factory, with its belching smoke and clamour, is a thing of the moment; it is a transient fever upon the skin of the country, destined to crumble into its own insignificant dust. But the stones of that ruin, they are the very bones of the nation itself. They speak of a foundation, a fundamental character which cannot be so easily supplanted, for every new road we lay and every wire we string must invariably follow the contours of a land shaped by forgotten hands.
