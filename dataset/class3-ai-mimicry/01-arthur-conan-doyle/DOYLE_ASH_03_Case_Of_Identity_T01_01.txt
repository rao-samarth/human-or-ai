In this quiet market town, the casual observer might perceive naught but a placid and unbroken serenity. The butcher, with his ruddy cheeks and booming laugh, offers a performance of contentment for every customer who crosses his threshold; the vicar, too, strides with a purpose that suggests a spirit untroubled by doubt. Yet I have seen the former late at night, when the shutters are drawn and the lamps extinguished, his countenance a mask of such profound weariness that one might believe him to be a man bearing the weight of some secret, unspeakable sorrow. Indeed, the entire village presents a singularly deceptive front. Its neatly kept gardens and polite morning greetings are but the thinnest of veneers, laid over private griefs and struggles quite unknown to the world. One learns, after a time, to read not the smiling face but the flicker in the eye—for it is in these minute, unguarded manifestations that the true narrative of a man’s soul is written.
