As our carriage rattled through the mountain pass, I observed a most singular local custom, one which, I confess, struck me initially as a piece of charming but primitive superstition. The villagers, young and old alike, were setting tiny, candle-lit boats upon the current of a swift-moving stream, a pretty spectacle against the encroaching twilight. Upon making some discreet inquiry, however, a far more profound purpose was revealed to me. This was no mere offering to some provincial water-spirit; it was, in fact, a yearly reaffirmation of their community's endurance. Each light, my guide explained, represented a piece of wisdom—a skill, a story, a discovery—passed from one soul to another, sent forth upon the waters of time not in hope of a boon, but in celebration of the unbroken chain of human ingenuity. It was a most heartening revelation, suggesting that even in the world's quietest corners, the great lamp of progress is kept faithfully trimmed.
