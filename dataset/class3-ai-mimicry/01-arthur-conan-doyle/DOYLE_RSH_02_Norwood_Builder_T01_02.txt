Pray, observe that fellow near the window, the one who so anxiously drums his fingers upon the table. One might take him for a man fretting over some common debt, yet I am reminded of a most curious case. The police, you see, were entirely convinced they had their man—a junior clerk implicated in a rather audacious forgery scheme. Every scrap of paper, every altered ledger, seemed to cry out his guilt. But the matter hinged upon a trifle, as it so often does. The ink, my friend, the ink was of a unique chemical composition, available from only one supplier in the city. The framed clerk had never purchased it, but our nervous gentleman by the window, a senior partner at the very same firm, had been acquiring it by the bottle for a year. A truly devilish artifice, to plant such convincing evidence while overlooking the one elementary detail that would unravel the entire fabrication.
