It was upon a rumbling train to the West Country that I witnessed a small drama which has since given me some cause for reflection. A young lad, his face a pale mask of terror, was discovered by the conductor to be quite without a ticket, and the proceedings threatened to become official. The conductor, a stout fellow with a formidable moustache, surveyed the trembling culprit for a long moment; one could see the internal debate between his duty to the railway company and some finer human instinct. Then, with a gruff dismissal, he turned away, and I knew the boy would not be handed over to the constables at the next station. I have always held that while the statute book is a necessary guide, its rigid application by a man without discretion makes a mockery of true justice—indeed, there are moments when the most profound adherence to the law is to be found in setting it aside entirely.
