The fire cast long shadows across the drawing-room, where my uncle, a man of considerable bulk and still greater opinion, sat hunched over the chessboard. His opponent was his own son, a slight, pale youth whose victories were found not upon the rugby pitch but within the dusty pages of forgotten tomes. It was a lamentable sight, in its way; the old lion, whose roar had once shaken boardrooms and hunting lodges alike, was now utterly cornered by a series of quiet, deliberate movements upon the chequered field. He would shift his great shoulders and glare at the carved pieces as if he might intimidate them into a more favourable formation, but the boy’s inexorable logic held them fast. With a final, almost apologetic, push of a pawn, the game was concluded. There was no shout of victory, no bellow of defeat; only the soft click of wood on wood, a sound that seemed to me the very whisper of a new and quieter age eclipsing the old.
