I sat by the hearth, a most unwilling guest in this labourer’s cottage, and observed my host with that detached curiosity which a new specimen of humanity invariably excites in me. My entire life had furnished me with the conviction that the minds of such men were primitive instruments, suited only for the crudest of tasks and gratified by the basest of comforts. Yet here was a fellow, his hands calloused and grimed with the soil, meticulously reassembling the intricate brass works of a shattered timepiece with a surgeon’s delicacy. What was I to make of this? And what of that worn volume of Keats I spied upon the mantel, its pages thumbed with an affection that spoke of long familiarity? It was a confounding picture, a direct and insolent contradiction to all my established theories. For an instant, I felt the solid ground of my own certainties shift beneath me, a most disquieting sensation indeed, and was forced to ask myself whether my judgment of an entire stratum of society had been little more than an elaborate and comfortable prejudice.
