I was observing the young man at the neighbouring table, a specimen of that particular sort whose entire fortune appears to be invested in the gloss of his boots, when a messenger delivered him a small, grim-looking envelope. Upon perusing its contents, his face, which had hitherto been a mask of vapid self-satisfaction, crumpled in a most distressing fashion. I confess I prepared myself for the usual scene: a dramatic gasp, perhaps even the public indignity of tears, for such creatures are often governed by their immediate sentiments. Yet, something else occurred. I saw his knuckles whiten as he gripped the damask cloth, his breathing steady into a measured, deliberate rhythm, and the wild panic in his eyes recede, replaced by the hard, flat look of calculation. He had, it seemed, consulted the little grey machine within his skull and found it a far better counsellor than his fluttering heart. A most practical, if unedifying, victory for the intellect; he had simply realised that a public collapse would be a far greater inconvenience than whatever private catastrophe had befallen him.
