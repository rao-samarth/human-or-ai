It is a common error amongst those who practice the art of subterfuge to over-emphasise the grand gesture whilst neglecting the trifling, yet damning, detail; an error being demonstrated with remarkable ineptitude by the gentleman now pacing the Southampton quay. His was a performance of some ambition—a formidable moustache, a coat of distinctly foreign cut, and a gait that suggested a life spent fencing rather than filing ledgers. Yet, the illusion was a fragile one indeed. The moustache, you see, listed precariously to starboard, betraying the glue which held it in such a tenuous position. Moreover, for a supposed Viennese diplomat, his boots were unmistakably the product of a fine Northampton cobbler, and the surreptitious manner in which he consulted his English-made pocket watch at every passing moment spoke less of continental intrigue and more of a desperate anxiety not to miss the three o’clock to Portsmouth. The entire charade was, in short, a magnificent failure.
