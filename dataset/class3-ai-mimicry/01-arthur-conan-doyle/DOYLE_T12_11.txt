I discovered Professor Ellington, a man whose reputation for probity was hitherto beyond question, not in the drawing-room amidst the silver, but crouched before a small glass vitrine in the study. The hour was well past two, and the only illumination came from his own pocket-torch, its beam fixed upon a single, rather unassuming specimen of hardened pastry. He was attempting to prize open the case with a tortoise-shell letter opener, a tool so utterly unsuited to the task that his fumbling efforts were almost pitiable. “Finch has no right!” he hissed at me, his eyes wide with a peculiar fervour I had only previously seen in collectors of obscure coleoptera. “He misattributes its desiccated currants entirely—it is clearly of late Ottoman, not early Persian, bake! To leave it here, uncatalogued and misunderstood, is a crime against confectionery itself!” The sheer, earnest absurdity of his justification, delivered with the gravity of a man defusing an infernal machine, was a spectacle of a mind so entirely consumed that it had lost all proportion.
