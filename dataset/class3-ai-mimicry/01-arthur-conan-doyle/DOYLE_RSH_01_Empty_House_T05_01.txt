The old rectory slumbered amidst a landscape of profound and settled peace, its grey stones warmed by a benevolent afternoon sun. To any casual observer, the scene was one of utter tranquility; the air hummed with the lazy drone of bees, and the great oaks which dotted the parkland seemed the very picture of ancient, steadfast health. And yet, a more discerning eye might have paused upon the singular growth which crept, with an almost imperceptible industry, up the northern face of those very trees. It was a fungus of a most peculiar and vivid hue—a shade of verdigris so brilliant it appeared almost artificial against the rugged bark. Far from being a mere decorative blight, however, this creeping life was a silent and patient executioner. Beneath its beautiful, velvety surface, it insinuated its filaments deep into the heartwood, drawing the very essence from the colossal trunks until, in a decade or perhaps a century, nothing would remain but a hollowed, brittle shell, ready to splinter in the first high wind.
