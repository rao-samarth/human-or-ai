You look upon him and see only a creature of perfect composure, a gentleman whose every action is a study in quiet dignity. It is a damnable falsehood! You observe the placid surface and deduce a tranquil soul, but I tell you that you are grievously mistaken, observing the steady flicker of a lantern and knowing nothing of the raging storm against which it is sheltered. That very calmness which you so admire is naught but a desperate, calculated shield; a fortress of polite smiles and quiet nods erected against a sorrow so profound it would shatter a lesser spirit. We are drawn to the immaculate exterior, are we not? The unblemished reputation, the serene countenance. Yet it is a universal error, this faith in the visible, for the most terrible battles are those fought in the silent chambers of the heart, wholly concealed from the careless eye of the world.
