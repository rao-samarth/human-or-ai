It is a singular thing, is it not, how the provincial rogue so often overestimates his own craftiness? Our local magistrate, a man of some sly reputation, believed his little scheme concerning the inheritance to be impenetrable. He had counted upon the local folklore, the superstitions of the bog, and the general disinclination of the constabulary to venture into the mire after dark. He laid his trail of false clues with a certain theatrical flair, a performance designed to mislead the senses and to prey upon the ignorance of his neighbours. Yet his entire enterprise, so elaborate in its deceptions, rested upon a single, flawed premise—that no one would simply apply a modicum of botanical knowledge to the problem. For while deceit may weave a most complex web, a single strand of pure, unassailable logic, drawn taut, is all that is required to tear it asunder. His was a mind built for the stage-play, not for the quiet, irrefutable truths of the natural world.
