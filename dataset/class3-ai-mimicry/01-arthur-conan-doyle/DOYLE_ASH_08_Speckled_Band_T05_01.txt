The rhythmic clatter of the wheels upon the track seemed to beat out a somber measure, attuned to the melancholy turn of my own reflections. I considered again the matter of the unseen wound—the sort of injury which leaves no mark upon the flesh but which eats away at the very soul of a person. There is a peculiar and damnable villainy, I mused, in the torment which is administered by a thousand tiny cuts; each one so slight as to be deniable, a mere trifle in itself, yet which, taken together, constitute a fatal bleeding of the spirit. What recourse has the victim against a persecutor whose weapons are a carefully chosen word, a look of manufactured disappointment, or the strategic withholding of some small, customary kindness? The law may take cognisance of a brutal blow, but it remains utterly powerless before this more subtle and, I daresay, more diabolical form of destruction, which unfolds behind the heavy curtains of a respectable home, its slow work witnessed by no one.
