He was a man of common stock, a drayman by his rough-spun coat, yet his attention was not upon the drudgery of his waiting cart but upon the intricate ironwork of the new omnibus station. With a piece of chalk, and upon a grimy slate he had propped against a crate, he was sketching—not idly, but with the fierce precision of a master draftsman—a modification to the primary truss, so ingenious in its conception that the logic of it struck me with the force of a blow. Here, I comprehended, was a mind fit to design marvels, a veritable engineer of the coming age, yet he was condemned by want of birth and fortune to haul goods for a few shillings a day. What was a gentleman to do? To approach him would be an impertinence, an offer of patronage he might well resent; yet to turn away was to be complicit in a wretched crime against nature herself, which had seen fit to place so fine an instrument in so poor a vessel.
