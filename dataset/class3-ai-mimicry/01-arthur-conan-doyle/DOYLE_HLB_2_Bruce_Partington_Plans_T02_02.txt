I surveyed the glittering ballroom, a sea of silks and gleaming medals, and could not help but reflect upon the peculiar nature of the burdens carried within that very room. It is a strange and terrible thing, is it not, that the fate of an empire might hinge not upon the strength of its dreadnoughts or the number of its battalions, but upon a single diagram committed to memory, or a cipher scribbled upon a gentleman’s cuff? Observe that fellow by the pillar—the one with the unnervingly placid expression. He carries in his head, I have no doubt, a fact which, if spoken aloud, could send a thousand good men to an early grave and plunge half of Europe into war. Such knowledge is a poison, a corrosive agent that eats at a man’s soul, for its misplacement, whether by treachery or by a moment's carelessness, invites a catastrophe of the gravest order. The entire edifice of our security rests upon the silence of a handful of such men.
