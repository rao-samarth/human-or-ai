By all public accounts, Mr. Alistair Finch was the very bedrock of our provincial community; his name was the first upon every charitable subscription, and his grave, dignified presence was a fixture at every town meeting. One saw him upon the high street, nodding with a sober and paternal air to all who passed, his expression one of unimpeachable rectitude. Yet it has been my fortune—or perhaps my misfortune—to observe him upon more private occasions, and I have marked the singular change which comes over the man when the public eye is withdrawn. I have seen a flash of cold, reptilian cunning in his gaze when a tenant farmer pleaded for more time, and I have heard the cruel and cutting turn of his wit directed at some unfortunate subordinate. It is a sobering reflection that the most outwardly perfect edifice may be riddled with a most profound decay, for I have come to believe that behind this man’s sterling reputation there resides a soul as dark and cold as a winter’s night.
