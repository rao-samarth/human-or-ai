There is, I have long observed, no more corrosive acid to the bonds of fellowship than the sudden prospect of immense and unearned wealth. I watched my fellow passenger in the carriage, a certain Mr. Finch, whose deference towards the portly magnate seated opposite was of that exaggerated quality which speaks less of genuine respect and more of a sordid transaction. His every nod, his every strained and eager smile, seemed a coin paid towards some future favour. A single glance at the man’s shifty eyes, which darted from the magnate’s diamond pin to the contents of his own worn valise, was sufficient to understand the matter entirely. Here was a man who, for the promise of a fuller purse, was quite prepared to sell the secrets—and indeed the very reputation—of the colleague who had trusted him implicitly for a decade. It is a sad, yet common, spectacle: the swift and utter dissolution of a man's honour when a sufficient pecuniary temptation is laid before him.
