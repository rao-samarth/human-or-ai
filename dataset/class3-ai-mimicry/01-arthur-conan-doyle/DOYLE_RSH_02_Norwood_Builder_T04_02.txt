For upon one small, yet altogether incontrovertible, point of fact, the entire elaborate case constructed by the Crown must inevitably shatter. They had produced witnesses and sworn documents which, taken together, formed a most damning narrative; yet they had neglected a simple railway timetable—a public record which proved, with the cold and immutable certainty of mathematics, that their chief witness could not possibly have been at his stated vantage point at the appointed hour. It is a curious feature of complex deceptions that they often neglect the mundane. And so, amidst the din of the thoroughfares and the grim pronouncements from the court, I held fast to this single, gleaming truth, entirely confident that it alone would be sufficient to burn away the fog of accusation and restore a good man’s name.
