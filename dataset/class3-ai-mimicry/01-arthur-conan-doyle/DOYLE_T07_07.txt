The Magistrate, a man of some local consequence and considerable girth, stood upon the steps of the guildhall, his voice ringing with that particular timbre of unshakeable self-assurance. He had concluded his reading of the new ordinance—a most peremptory document which curtailed certain long-held grazing rights—and looked down upon the assembled villagers with the air of a man expecting, if not applause, then at least a grudging compliance. What followed, however, was a phenomenon of a most singular nature. No cry was raised, no missile was thrown; rather, a silent communication seemed to pass through the throng. First one man, then his neighbour, and then another, until the entire company of them had performed a slow, deliberate turn, presenting to their would-be master a solid wall of homespun-clad backs. It was a gesture of profound and universal contempt, rendered all the more potent for its absolute quiet, and the Magistrate’s ruddy countenance turned a shade of deepest purple as he grappled with this novel form of insubordination—one against which his pronouncements were utterly powerless.
