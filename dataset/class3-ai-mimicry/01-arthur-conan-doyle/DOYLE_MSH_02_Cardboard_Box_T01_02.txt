It was, I believe, as the musicians struck up a waltz that I first perceived the true nature of the evening’s calamity. I watched her from across the drawing-room, her face animated in a way I had not seen for a great many months, and all for the benefit of a man whose insufferable confidence was a known affront to every gentleman present. A venom which had long been brewing in my soul rose then, a black passion that clouded all judgement and reduced the entire glittering assembly to mere shadows. I confronted him in the library upon some trifling pretext, and he turned to me with a smile of such condescending pity that reason fled my grasp entirely. He made some remark—I cannot now recall what—and in the next instant, the heavy silver letter-opener was in my hand. It was not a calculated act, you must understand, but a sudden, dreadful fever of the mind, and now this house, once a home, is naught but a monument to my own ruinous folly.
