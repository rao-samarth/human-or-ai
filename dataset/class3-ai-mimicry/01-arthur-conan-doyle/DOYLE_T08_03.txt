I overheard, in a rather dingy public-house near the docks, a most vehement dispute between two men of a labouring class, their voices rising above the general din. One, whose face was flushed with spirits and indignation, spoke of a grievous wrong done to his kin, and he insisted, with many a thump of his fist upon the table, that a direct and painful reckoning was the only true remedy. The aggrieved party, you see, so often confuses the restoration of a moral equilibrium with the simple sating of a personal appetite for reprisal. He seeks not fairness, but a satisfaction that is, at its heart, a most animalistic impulse—a thing of blood and not of reason. Society, in its wisdom, has attempted to erect a dispassionate tribunal to stand between the wrongdoer and the wrath of the wronged; yet in the breast of every man, the hot-blooded cry for a pound of flesh will often drown the colder, more difficult plea for a measured weight upon the scales.
