The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across the study, where the woman stood, her confession hanging in the silent air between us. By every statute of the realm, she was a criminal; her actions, though committed under the most extreme duress, would lead her directly to the assizes and, in all likelihood, to the gallows. The official course was plain: one need only lift the receiver of that telephone to set the entire, unforgiving machinery of the constabulary in motion. Yet, to do so would be to punish the victim for at last striking back at her tormentor. I considered the evidence before me—not the purloined letters upon the floor, but the years of cruelty etched upon her face. In that moment, I found I could not be an agent of a law which, in its rigid application, would produce so profound an injustice. Henceforth, this matter was an affair of conscience, not of the Crown.
