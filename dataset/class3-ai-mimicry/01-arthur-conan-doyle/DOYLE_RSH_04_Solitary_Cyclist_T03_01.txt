The stillness of the Wexley Woods was shattered in an instant. There, by the old stone wall marking the boundary of Sir Eustace’s failing estate, we came upon them—three figures, hunched over a surveyor's map in the pale moonlight. It was not mere trespass; it was a council of war. Mr. Abernathy, the banker, whose purse strings held the county in a stranglehold; the vicar, a man whose piety was but a cloak for his rapacious land-hunger; and young Fitzwilliam, the heir whose impatience had festered into a venomous plot. They had not seen us. The snap of a twig under my companion's boot sent their heads whipping around, faces aghast. Abernathy was the first to move, snatching the map and bolting into the thicket like a common thief. For what else, I ask you, could drive such pillars of the community to this clandestine villainy, this nocturnal pact, but the oldest and basest of human desires? The scent of another man's gold, the promise of a fortune carved from his ruin—it is an intoxicant for which souls are readily sold.
