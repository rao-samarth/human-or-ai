Pray, lower your voice, my dear chap, though I daresay the babble of this public dining-room is sufficient cover. You ask why I seem so distracted, so grave? It is because I carry a weight that would crush a lesser man—a matter of state, you understand, of such a delicate and explosive composition that I scarcely dare to think upon it myself. To the gentlemen at that adjacent table, I am merely a fellow diner enjoying his port; they cannot conceive that the man beside them holds a piece of knowledge that, were it to slip from his lips, could set the telegraphs of Europe ablaze and send armies marching before breakfast. It is a damnable position, to know that the tranquility of an entire continent rests upon one's discretion, and yet, what can one do? A man must do his duty, however frightful the cost to his own peace of mind.
