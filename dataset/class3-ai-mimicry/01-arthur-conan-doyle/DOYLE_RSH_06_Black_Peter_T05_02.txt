I overheard them from my wingchair—two young barristers, all full of righteous indignation as they discussed the recent affairs of the formidable Mr. Ellington. They spoke of ruined men and desperate families with the sort of abstract horror that comes from a life of comfort; a regrettable business, to be sure, but one which they failed to grasp in its entirety. A man in Ellington’s position, who presides over a commercial empire upon which so many depend, cannot afford the luxury of sentiment when a weak branch threatens the health of the entire tree. His public benefactions and his unimpeachable character are not a mask for his grimmer dealings; on the contrary, they are the very fruits of them. He applies the surgeon's knife to the gangrenous limb of his enterprise, a painful but necessary operation, so that the city at large may continue to enjoy the robust health his good works and steady commerce provide. It is a simple calculus that these younger men have yet to learn.
