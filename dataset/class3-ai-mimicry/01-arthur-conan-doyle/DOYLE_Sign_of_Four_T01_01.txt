Lord Ashworth scoffed, swirling the amber liquid in his crystal glass as the orchestra swelled in the adjacent ballroom. "You speak of honour, Davies, a currency for paupers and poets. Look around you! This is what power affords—not some dusty notion of virtue." I watched as Davies, his face a pale mask of indignation, stepped closer, his voice a low counterpoint to the distant violins. "On the contrary, my lord," he retorted, his words precise and cold as a surgeon's scalpel, "it is a currency you can no longer afford. You have traded it all away, piece by piece, for these baubles and this hollow grandeur. A man who possesses everything yet values nothing is the most impoverished creature I have ever had the misfortune to observe; for his spirit, once a noble estate, has been sold off to the meanest of tenants, and he is left rattling about in the empty halls of his own heart." Ashworth’s sneer faltered, for the thrust had, for a single, telling moment, found its mark.
