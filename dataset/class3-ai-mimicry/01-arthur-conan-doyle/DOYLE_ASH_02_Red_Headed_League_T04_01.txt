As our train slowed, affording a brief view of the sleepy Ashworth platform, my friend directed my gaze not towards the passengers but to a most unremarkable object: the station-master's green watering can. It stood by the door of his office, brimming with water, its surface placid and undisturbed. “Observe,” he murmured, a glint of intellectual fire in his eyes, “the flowerbeds are quite parched, and have been for days, yet that vessel is never employed for its intended purpose; it remains perpetually full. A curious detail, is it not? A trifle, perhaps, but one which suggests a pre-arranged signal. For what purpose would a man keep a full can of water but never use it, unless its state—full or empty—were a message in itself? I should wager we are looking upon the very hub of a county-wide poison distribution, a silent and deadly post office operating under the very noses of the local constabulary.”
