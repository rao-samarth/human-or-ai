Amidst the polite murmur of the Admiral’s ball, my eye was drawn to the Harrington family, who stood near the grand conservatory. A more wretched-looking group I have seldom seen, for all their fine silks and starched collars. The patriarch, a man of military bearing, fixed his gaze upon some distant point, utterly ignoring his wife’s anxious attempts to engage him in conversation. Their two daughters, meanwhile, maintained a frigid distance from one another, their smiles as thin and brittle as spun glass. It struck me then what a truly ruinous force is at work when the bonds of kinship become chains of resentment. Here was not a home, but a battleground in miniature, where every shared glance was a volley and every silence a siege. Such a house, I reflected, must be a colder and more desolate place than any winter moor, for the chill emanates not from without, but from the very hearts of its inhabitants.
