As the last of the evening light bled away behind the distant tors, it struck me that a man who pursues truth with a singular focus must, on occasion, find himself in a most unenviable position. The constabulary, with its rigid manuals and its predictable methods, sees only the infraction and the statute designed to address it; it is a mechanism, and a blunt one at that.

To hand such a delicate and complex matter to the crude machinery of the courts would be an act of barbarism in itself. No, there are times, and this was one, when the final ledger must be balanced by the same hand that first discovered the debt, for in the quiet solitude of the intellect, a purer form of justice may be found than in any crowded, gaslit courtroom.
