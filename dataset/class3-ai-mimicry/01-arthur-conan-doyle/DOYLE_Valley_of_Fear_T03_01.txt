You must understand, my dear fellow, that the man's predicament is not merely one of simple deception; it is a war waged within a single soul. To maintain two wholly separate spheres of existence—each with its own affections, its own obligations, and, indeed, its own particular falsehoods—requires a mental fortitude that no mortal possesses indefinitely. The strain of such a partition is immense, for every moment becomes a calculation and every acquaintance a potential threat. He is a captain steering two ships through a storm at once, and a single error in navigation, a single cross-wind of chance, will not merely ground one vessel but will surely cause them to collide with ruinous force. The true peril, you see, lies not only in discovery by others, but in the inevitable moment when the man himself can no longer distinguish which shore he is sailing for, and in that confusion, he is utterly lost.
