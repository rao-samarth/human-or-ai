The Professor drew forth the threads of his intricate design with a lecturer's dispassionate clarity—the matter of the forged ministry papers, the substituted courier, the deliberately leaked and false itinerary—each point laid out with the cold precision of a surgeon. Throughout this recitation, his adversary remained quite motionless, a statue carved from shadow and contempt, his steepled fingers resting beneath his chin. “You perceive, then,” the Professor concluded, a note of dry triumph in his voice, “that your position has become quite untenable.” A slow, thin smile was the only reply for a moment, before the other man spoke, his tone one of mere academic curiosity. “I confess I anticipated your substitution of the courier a full fortnight ago; the dispatches my man now carries are, I assure you, rather different from those you so cleverly intercepted.” Here, then, was the dreadful impasse: not a battle of force, but a perfect and terrible equilibrium of two minds, each the precise mirror of the other’s cunning, each move predicted and each counter-stroke foreseen, leaving them locked in a silence more profound than any threat.
