You have played your game with a certain low artfulness, Mr. Davies, I shall grant you that. Your manipulation of the quarterly reports was a neat piece of work, designed to cast suspicion upon a man who had already departed our firm, and you covered your tracks with a diligence that might have been commendable in a more honest enterprise. But you made one elementary error, an oversight so common amongst those who believe their own shrewdness to be an impenetrable shield. You presumed that no one would examine the source of your figures, only their final sum. Pray, observe the paper stock on which your falsified invoices are printed; it is a watermark we did not procure until March of this year. How, then, could it possibly bear the shipping dates of the previous autumn? It is upon such trifling yet immutable facts, sir, that elaborate deceptions are so often and so utterly dashed to pieces.
