It was upon the old Bixley road, with the last vestiges of daylight bleeding from the sky, that I first perceived the dreadful change in Abernathy. The man, whom I had known for years as the very picture of a stolid and respectable landowner, came charging past the hedgerow, his face a mask of frantic exertion. He did not so much run as lurch, stumbling forwards in a desperate flight from some unseen pursuer; his arms flailed wildly, striking at the placid evening air as if to beat back a swarm of invisible assailants. I called out his name, a sharp and commanding sound in the encroaching twilight, yet he paid me no heed whatsoever, his eyes fixed upon a point some six feet behind his shoulder. To see a man of such sound constitution and sober habits reduced in an instant to this pitiable, animalistic state was to glimpse the appalling frailty of the mechanism which governs us, and to know that its gears may be stripped and broken by a terror which has no earthly name.
