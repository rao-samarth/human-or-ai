You must understand that it was, in its essence, a matter of simple observation, a study in human frailty made manifest within the confines of our small parish. The good woman was quite undone by her recent and tragic bereavement; her judgment, I perceived, was clouded by a profound and all-consuming grief, rendering her susceptible to any voice that offered a semblance of firm guidance. I offered no falsehoods, gentlemen, nor did I press her unduly. I merely presented my most reasonable proposal at a moment when her own faculties for shrewd negotiation were at their lowest ebb, a period during which the slightest kindness might be mistaken for the most profound loyalty. Was it my duty to await her full recovery, when any other man might have seized the same advantage with far less delicacy? It was a simple calculation of opportunity, a recognition that a heart in turmoil is often a most pliable instrument for the furtherance of one’s own necessary ends.
