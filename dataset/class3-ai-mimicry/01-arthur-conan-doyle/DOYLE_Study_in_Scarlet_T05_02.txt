You perceive this affair as a mere exercise in retribution, a dangerous game born of a disordered mind. I see the question in your eyes, my friend, and I do not fault you for it, for you never had the privilege of knowing Eleanor. You did not witness the particular grace with which she moved through this world, nor did you comprehend the profound and steadying influence she held over my own impetuous nature. When that light was so brutally extinguished, it left a void so absolute that no earthly pursuit could ever hope to fill it. Therefore, this singular path I now tread, this all-consuming investigation which you deem so perilous, is not driven by hatred for the man who wronged me; rather, it is the final, desperate act of a man who has nothing else to give to the woman he has lost. It is the only logic that remains in a world rendered utterly senseless by her absence.
