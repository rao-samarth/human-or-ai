The grate held only the faintest glow of its former ferocity, and in the hush my friend, a man of considerable industry but little foresight, had occupied himself with the singular construction of a card-house. It was a most precarious edifice, rising tier by fragile tier upon the polished mahogany. He saw in its completion the triumph of a steady hand and a calculated will, a small monument to his own meticulous design. Yet I could see it only as a thing hostage to fortune—to a sudden draught from the ill-fitting window, or to the merest tremor of the floorboards beneath us. Was his achievement, then, a product of his own sovereign choice, or merely the fortunate interval between one inevitable collapse and the next; a question which, I fancy, occupies men of far greater import than the architect of this trifling paper palace.
