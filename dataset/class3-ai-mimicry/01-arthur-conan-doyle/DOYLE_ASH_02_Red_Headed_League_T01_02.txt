I found myself observing my cousin, Henry, who held court near the pianoforte, regaling a small circle of aunts with a tale of some recent continental adventure. To all appearances, he was the very picture of a man at ease with his station; his laughter was ready, his posture relaxed, and his narrative peppered with the sort of confident wit that so often charms a room. And yet, I could not help but notice the constant, almost imperceptible drumming of his fingers upon the polished mahogany lid, a rhythm of nervous energy entirely at odds with his placid expression. Furthermore, his eyes, whilst bright, never truly settled upon any one of his listeners, but rather darted about the room as if searching for an escape or anticipating an unwelcome arrival. It was a curious dissonance, this performance of perfect contentment laid over a foundation of what I could only deduce was a profound and carefully concealed agitation.
