As the carriage swayed on its journey northward, my idle gaze fell upon the man seated across from me, a figure who, upon first inspection, was entirely unremarkable. Yet it is upon such unremarkable canvases that the most telling portraits are often painted. His boots, though polished, bore upon the left heel a peculiar scuffing of reddish clay, a soil quite foreign to our London environs but common in the dales of the Peak District. Upon his waistcoat, I noted a single, almost imperceptible, sprig of bog-myrtle, a plant which flourishes upon those same moors. From these simple facts, a clear picture began to emerge: he was no city man journeying out, but a countryman returning home, one who had walked some distance from a station to conduct his business and who now carried the scent and soil of his native lands with him, a silent declaration of his origins more eloquent than any spoken word.
