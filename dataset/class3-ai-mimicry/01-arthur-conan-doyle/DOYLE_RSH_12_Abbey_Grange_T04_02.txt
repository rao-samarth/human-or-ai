You must forgive, my dear fellow, the slight but necessary embellishment I offered to the constable in his enquiries this morning. To have told him the plain truth—that the poor stable-boy was hiding in the hayloft from a master whose temper is as vicious as his fists—would have been to condemn the lad to a far worse fate than the one from which he fled. It was a trifling matter to invent a story of a sudden message calling him to his ailing grandmother in the next village; a fiction, I grant you, but one which served a higher purpose than a bald and brutal recitation of fact. The constable, satisfied with this simple explanation, has ceased his search, and the boy is, by now, well on his way to a new and safer life with his uncle across the shire. There are times, I find, when a carefully administered falsehood is the most effective antidote for cruelty, and this was most assuredly one of them.
