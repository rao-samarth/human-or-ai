My dear Alistair, you enquire as to the ultimate fate of young Penrose, and I must confess the matter concluded in a fashion more dreadful than any of us could have foreseen. His devotion to the charming Miss Eva, which at first appeared a most commendable passion, had in fact soured into a species of mania, a suffocating ownership that allowed her no liberty. He begrudged her every moment spent away from him, viewing the most innocent conversation on a bustling thoroughfare as a profound betrayal. It was an affection that sought not to cherish but to cage its object, and such a thing cannot long endure in this world. The final, grim discovery at her lodgings near the Embankment served as the lamentable proof; he could not bear the thought of her belonging to another, and so, with a terrible and selfish finality, he ensured she would henceforth belong to no one at all.
