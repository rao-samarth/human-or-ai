The house is silent now, my dear fellow, and in the late hour I find myself reflecting upon a most singular departure from my usual methods. You, with your unswerving devotion to the demonstrable fact, would have pronounced my actions today the very pinnacle of folly. Every piece of evidence I had painstakingly assembled, every cold and damning particular, pointed to the young man’s absolute culpability; the chain of logic was complete, and its conclusion inescapable. And yet, when I at last looked upon his face—a visage not of cunning, but of such profound and artless despair—I found the entire edifice of my reasoning crumbling to dust before my eyes. In that singular instant, I cast aside the entire ledger of probabilities and acted upon an impulse so potent, so utterly contrary to the faculties I most prize, that I can scarcely account for it even now as the embers die in the grate.
