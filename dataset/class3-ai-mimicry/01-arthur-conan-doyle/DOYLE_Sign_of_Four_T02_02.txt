I observed my elder cousin, Mr. Alistair Finch, as he sat somewhat apart from the general cheer of our annual family assembly. The news of his rival's utter financial and social ruin had reached us all, and it was understood that Alistair’s own hand had, after a patient campaign of two decades, guided the man to his destruction. Yet I could discern no trace of victory in his pale and weary countenance; rather, he seemed a man from whom some vital support had been withdrawn. For years, this singular animosity had been the very fuel of his existence, the iron in his blood. Now, with the object of his long and bitter pursuit utterly vanquished, the fire within him seemed to have died down to a few cold embers. He had won his war, it was true, but in so doing had laid waste to his own soul, and now surveyed the desolate peace of his own creation, a king of ashes and of solitude.
