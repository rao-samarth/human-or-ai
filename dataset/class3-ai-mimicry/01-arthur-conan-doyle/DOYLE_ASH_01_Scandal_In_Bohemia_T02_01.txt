Professor Albrighton settled back in his chair, a look of supreme satisfaction upon his features as he addressed the quiet woman seated opposite him. “It is, therefore, manifestly clear that only a man of extraordinary athletic prowess could have scaled the wall to the vicar’s study; a singular feat which at once narrows our field of inquiry.” He tapped a long, manicured finger upon the arm of his chair, his celebrated mind having, it seemed, delivered its final verdict. It was then that Miss Gable, the unassuming town librarian, finally looked up from her mending. “You have overlooked the gardener’s ladder, Professor,” she stated, her tone one of simple fact. He waved a dismissive hand. “A trifle, my dear lady, a common domestic article of no consequence.” She met his gaze without a tremor. “Yet it is a trifle which was not returned to the shed until dusk, and which still bears the scuff marks of a gentleman’s dress shoe—the very same scuff, I fancy, that one might observe upon the vicar’s own footwear, were one to look closely.” A cold silence fell upon the room, for in her simple, unadorned observation lay the complete destruction of his elaborate theory.
