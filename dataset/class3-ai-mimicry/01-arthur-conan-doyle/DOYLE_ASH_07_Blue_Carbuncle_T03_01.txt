The clock upon the mantel had long since struck midnight, yet I remained settled in my chair, observing the last embers of the fire as they glowed and faded. My thoughts were occupied not with some intricate problem of chemistry or logic, but with the letter that lay open upon the side-table. Its author, a man whom society had, with some justification, cast out upon a ruinous path, had written to convey his remarkable progress. It was an outcome I had scarcely dared to anticipate when I had offered him a means of extrication from his lamentable circumstances. To witness a character so utterly remade, to see the evidence of industry and principle where before there had been only recklessness, is a most singular experience. It suggests that the final ruination of a man is often a matter of mere momentum, and that the introduction of a single, stable point upon which he may gain a fresh purchase is frequently all that is required to divert his course entirely from the abyss.
