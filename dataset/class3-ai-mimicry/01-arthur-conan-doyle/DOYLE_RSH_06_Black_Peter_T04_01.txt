I confess it does my heart a considerable good, this news concerning young Alistair Finch. To see a man so thoroughly and publicly exonerated, after having endured such a weight of unearned ignominy, is a spectacle which reaffirms one’s faith in the machinery of our legal system. It is a slow and ponderous apparatus, to be sure, and one which on occasion grinds exceeding fine in the wrong direction; yet, to witness its ability to reverse its own motion and correct a grievous error is a truly remarkable thing. The true villain is now where he belongs, and Mr. Finch may walk with his head held high once more. It serves as a potent reminder, does it not, that the truth, however deeply it may be buried beneath a mountain of calumny and circumstance, possesses a singular vitality. It will, with persistence and the application of cold reason, invariably find its way to the light.
