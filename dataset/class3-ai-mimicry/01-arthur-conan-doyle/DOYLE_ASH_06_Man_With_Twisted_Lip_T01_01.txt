It has always been a peculiar pastime of mine, when confined to the close quarters of a railway carriage, to study the faces of my fellow travellers and to deduce from them what I can. Here sits a man whose frayed cuffs and weary countenance bespeak a life of clerical drudgery, yet I perceive in the keenness of his eye a mind that has grappled with problems far beyond the simple balancing of ledgers. It is a fundamental error, and a singularly common one, to mistake the shell for the kernel; to judge the contents of a mind by the cut of a coat. The most unprincipled scoundrel I ever brought to justice possessed the open, guileless face of a country curate, whilst a man of genuine philanthropic spirit was cursed with a physiognomy so forbidding that children would fly from him in the street. No, the world is a grand stage of masks, and he who would truly understand it must learn to look not at the player’s costume, but at the subtle, involuntary tremor of the hand that betrays the true man beneath.
