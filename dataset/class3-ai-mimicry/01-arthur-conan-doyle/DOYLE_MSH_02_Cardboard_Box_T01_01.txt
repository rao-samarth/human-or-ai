As I navigate these teeming thoroughfares, where every second face betrays some private anxiety, I find my thoughts returning to that dreadful business in Islington. It is a most singular and lamentable thing, is it not, how the most potent of human poisons can be brewed from the most trivial of circumstances? A mere glance, a letter misunderstood, a whispered word in a crowded room—from such innocuous seeds grows a monstrous passion which can drive an otherwise rational man to acts of unspeakable savagery. The papers will call it a crime of passion, a simple and brutish affair; yet to the discerning mind, it represents the utter collapse of reason before a force as old as the very stones beneath my feet. What a ruin it has made of two lives, and all for a suspicion that may well have been nothing more than a phantom of the mind.
