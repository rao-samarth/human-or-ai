It was over the port that I observed the rather chilly denouement of a quarrel which had, in truth, begun a generation before any of us at the table were born. My cousin’s prospective father-in-law, a baronet of the old school, had just made it clear, with a civility more wounding than any open abuse, that no union between the families could ever be contemplated. The cause? Not a matter of fortune, nor of character, but the simple, unalterable fact that my cousin’s grandfather had been a prominent voice against the Corn Laws. That the entire affair was a dusty matter of history, settled by Parliament decades ago, signified nothing; the old grievance, a perceived betrayal of one’s class and country, had been nursed and passed down like a cursed heirloom. It is a singular phenomenon, I mused, how a public disagreement can outlive the men who championed it, its shadow stretching across the years to blight the prospects of those who had no part in the original contest whatsoever.
