I directed my companion’s attention to the curious affair unfolding at the fishmonger’s stall, a matter which, though trifling in appearance, presented a most singular puzzle. A stout gentleman with a formidable moustache was attempting, with a rather pained expression, to arrange a selection of haddocks into what I could only perceive as a crude representation of the constellation Orion. His confederate, a nervous-looking fellow hovering near the cabbages, responded by anxiously repositioning three leeks. It was a silent, frantic dialogue, a coded exchange of the most peculiar sort. Yet their entire elaborate system was brought to ruin by the fishmonger himself—a bull-necked individual of no sentiment—who, with a roar of impatience, would periodically scoop up the carefully placed haddocks and wrap them in newspaper for a waiting customer, reducing the celestial message to a mere pound of fish and utterly confounding its intended recipient.
