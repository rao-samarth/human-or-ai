My dear Ainsworth, you ask for my opinion, and you shall have it, though you may not care for the hearing. This is no simple matter of a pilfered jewel or a common blackmailer at work; we are dealing with a far more insidious brand of chicanery, one which smells of foreign courts and has the potential to set the whole of Europe ablaze. I have watched this so-called cultural envoy from St. Petersburg for a week, and his interest in our nation’s art is a mere charade—a flimsy cover for his clandestine meetings in the less salubrious quarters of the city. He is not here to admire Turner, my friend; he is here to purchase state secrets. The man he met last night by the gas-lamps of Seven Dials was no art dealer, I can assure you of that. Believe me when I say that a very dangerous game is being played upon our own soil, and the stakes are nothing less than the security of the Crown itself.
