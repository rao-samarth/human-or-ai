From my carriage window, I observed a man upon the platform whose weathered face and coarse tweed jacket spoke at once of a life of hard, rustic labour. A farmer, I deduced, doubtless lamenting the price of grain or some other such bucolic trouble. His posture was one of dejection, his gaze fixed upon the gravel at his feet. It was a complete and satisfying picture, formed in an instant. Yet, as my train began its slow departure, a well-appointed motor-car drew up, from which emerged a lady and two children whose fine dress was utterly at odds with my rustic theory. The man’s face broke into a smile of pure relief and affection as he embraced them; he was no farmer, but a gentleman returning to his waiting family. It is a constant and humbling lesson: the mind abhors a vacuum and will construct a narrative from the slenderest of threads, a practice which, if left unchecked, leads the keenest observer into the most profound and embarrassing error.
