My Aunt Beatrice, a woman whose mind is a veritable mausoleum of forgotten embarrassments, saw fit to corner me beside the wilting aspidistra. "Is it not our little 'Bunny'?" she exclaimed, employing a ghastly diminutive from my nursery days, a name I had spent two decades and a considerable sum on education to bury. I made some noncommittal sound, for what reply can one offer to such wilful ignorance? One might return from the colonies a decorated governor-general, yet to these people, you would remain the boy who once mistook the sugar bowl for salt. Around the oppressive drawing-room, I perceived the same phenomenon repeated with a dreadful consistency: a respected surgeon enquired after his childhood lisp, a noted Parliamentarian complimented on having finally grown into his ears. It is the singular curse of kinship, I reflected, to be perpetually judged not by the man you have become, but by the half-formed creature you have struggled so valiantly to leave behind.
