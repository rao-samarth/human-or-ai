As the carriage rattled over the moorland road, I observed a most dreadful transformation in my companion, a man whom I had hitherto known as a creature of pure, dispassionate reason. His hands, which could trace the most delicate of chemical experiments, were clenched now into white-knuckled fists, and his gaze was fixed upon the grey, passing landscape with an intensity that was altogether chilling. He had spoken but once in the last hour, to name the blackguard who had brought such ruin upon the woman to whom his entire soul was devoted, and in the utterance of that name, I saw his purpose harden. A profound and noble love had, by some terrible alchemy of injustice, been transmuted into an equally profound and single-minded lust for retribution. It was a fearful thing to witness, for I knew that the man he hunted deserved the very worst that the law might devise, yet I could not quiet the question in my own heart as to whether I was now accomplice to a righteous judgment, or merely to a savage and private war.
