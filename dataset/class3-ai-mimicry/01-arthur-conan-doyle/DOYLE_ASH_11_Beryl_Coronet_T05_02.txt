Do not take me for a fool, man! You imagine I have not seen it? The slight tremor in your left hand as you handle the letter-opener, a tremor entirely absent when you raise your teacup. Then there is the matter of your boots—immaculately polished, save for a single, peculiar scuff of reddish clay upon the inner heel, a clay found, as you well know, only in the riverbanks beyond the old priory. A gentleman who professes to have spent his afternoon in his solicitor’s dusty chambers does not return with such specific soil, nor with the faint, yet unmistakable, scent of oil of vitriol clinging to his cuffs. No, your entire account is a fabrication, and a clumsy one at that! You were not consulting legal documents; you were at the abandoned laboratory, and that small, almost invisible burn mark upon your wrist is not from a stray cigar ash, as you claim, but from the hasty handling of a far more dangerous concoction.
