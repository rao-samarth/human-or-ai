You ask me, my dear fellow, how I perceive the present schism which has so thoroughly divided our directorate. It is, I must confess, a struggle of a most fundamental nature, one which I have witnessed in many guises throughout my long career. On one side stands Mr. Albright, a man of singular cunning and utter ruthlessness, who views our enterprise as a mere machine for the acquisition of wealth, and our clients as so many cogs to be ground down in its mechanism. Against him is arrayed not a grand army, but the simple, dogged principle of honest work and fair dealing—a principle which, I fear, finds fewer champions with each passing year. The contest is not fought in the open, with bold declarations, but in the shadowed corners of account books and through the careful phrasing of confidential memoranda. Mark my words; the outcome of this sordid affair will determine not merely the future of our company, but the very character of the men we are to become.
