The junior clerk, a Mr. Abernathy, was a figure whom my more boisterous colleagues had already dismissed as a creature of little import—a man defined by a threadbare coat and a perpetually downcast gaze. They saw only the hesitant stammer and the nervous shuffle of his feet upon the floorboards; indeed, to the casual eye, he presented a most unpromising picture. Yet, I had observed in him a quality which they had entirely missed. It was in the singular precision of his ledger, where every digit was a model of calligraphic perfection, and in the swift, almost imperceptible, flicker of understanding in his eyes when a complex financial matter was discussed. It gives one a certain hope, I find, to witness such a discrepancy; for while the world may judge a man by the cut of his jacket, true merit, like a well-tended flame in a sturdy lantern, will invariably make its light known when the moment is right.
