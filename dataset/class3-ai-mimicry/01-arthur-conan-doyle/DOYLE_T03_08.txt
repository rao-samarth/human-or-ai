You ask me to reconsider, my dear fellow, but you fail to grasp the essential nature of the situation. It is not a matter of commercial loss, which can be weathered, nor of personal pride, which is a fleeting and often foolish thing. Rather, it concerns the very bedrock upon which a man’s life is built. An imputation of this kind, however baseless, is like a drop of ink in a glass of water; it spreads, it taints, and soon the entire vessel is clouded beyond redemption. I could not permit my family’s name, which has stood for three generations without a blemish, to be subjected to such vile and persistent calumny. The cost of my actions, I assure you, is a trifle when weighed against the ruin of that which is truly priceless. A man is nothing if he is not the master of his own good name.
