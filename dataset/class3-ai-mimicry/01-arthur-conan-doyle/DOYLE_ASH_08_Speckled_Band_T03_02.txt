He had, it seemed, constructed the perfect crime upon the page. Yet, as the elder Mr. Croft held the document closer to the gas lamp for a better view, a peculiar thing occurred. The subtle warmth of the flame acted upon the forger’s special compound, causing his neat script to bleed into a ghastly, tell-tale purple smear, utterly distinct from the true writing. The very tool of his perfidy had become the agent of its own revelation, branding him a scoundrel before our very eyes.
