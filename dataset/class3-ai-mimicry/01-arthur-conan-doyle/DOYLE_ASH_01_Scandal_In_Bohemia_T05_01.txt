My dear chap, this monotonous journey through the Midlands affords me ample time for reflection, and my mind drifts back to the matter of the unfortunate financier. It has been my experience, and one which grows more firm with every passing year, that a man's honour is a possession he will guard with a ferocity far exceeding that which he might apply to his life or his fortune. He will countenance blackmail; he will weave the most labyrinthine deceptions; he may even be driven to violence—all to prevent the slightest stain from besmirching a name hitherto held in high esteem. What a curious vanity it is, this desperate clinging to public perception! The truth of a man's character is a thing of little consequence, it seems, when measured against the shadow it casts in the eyes of the world. It is a grim calculus, and one which I fear leads only to deeper and more desperate entanglements.
