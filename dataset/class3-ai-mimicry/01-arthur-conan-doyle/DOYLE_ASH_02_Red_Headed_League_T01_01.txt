Pray, do not affect such an expression of wounded innocence; your entire demeanour, which you have so painstakingly cultivated to appear commonplace, is precisely what gives you away. A truly simple man is simple without effort, yet every detail of your person, from the deliberate plainness of your coat to the meticulously controlled modulation of your voice, shrieks of artifice. You imagine that by presenting a surface of utter blandness, you have rendered yourself invisible to the discerning eye. On the contrary, sir, you have constructed a disguise so perfect, so devoid of any natural human flaw or incidental wrinkle, that it stands out to me like a beacon in a fog. The common man does not trouble himself with being common; he simply is. It is only the man with a very great deal to hide who would build such a fortress of mediocrity around himself, forgetting that the most conspicuous thing in a disordered world is, in fact, perfect order.
