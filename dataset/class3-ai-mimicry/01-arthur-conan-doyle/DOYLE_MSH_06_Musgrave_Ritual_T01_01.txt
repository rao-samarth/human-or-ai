My Aunt Mildred, a woman of formidable certainty and remarkably little curiosity, insists upon placing a silver coin within the pudding, a practice she defends with the unassailable logic of “it is what we have always done.” One hardly dares to point out that this quaint custom is but a shadow of some forgotten pagan appeal for fortune, a desperate plea to the gods of the harvest now reduced to a mere parlour game and a potential danger to one’s dental work. The entire family partakes in this charade with a most serious air, their faces aglow with the firelight and a vacuous sense of continuity. They believe they are honouring their forefathers; in truth, they are merely apes mimicking a gesture whose original stimulus has long since vanished from the world, leaving only the hollow, repeated motion behind. It is a spectacle of earnest mimicry, and one must confess, it is a trifle depressing.
