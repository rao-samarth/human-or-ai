By the flickering gas-lamp, I watched poor Fleming hunched over his great atlas, a sight that had become all too familiar in these trying weeks. His forefinger, stained with ink, traced the same imaginary path across the plains of Patagonia—a route he had invented and now held as gospel. He would mutter to himself of latitudes which bore no relation to any known cartography, his voice a low, insistent hum that filled the otherwise silent house. I had once dared to place a hand upon his shoulder, suggesting rest, and he flinched as if from a hot iron, his eyes blazing with a fire I had never before seen in a sane man. He spoke of a hidden city, of a treasure beyond comprehension, yet his logic had long since fled; indeed, the map itself was now so worn by his incessant pilgrimage that the continent had become a mere phantom of smudged ink and torn paper. He was no longer charting a course, but was utterly lost within the feverish geography of his own mind.
