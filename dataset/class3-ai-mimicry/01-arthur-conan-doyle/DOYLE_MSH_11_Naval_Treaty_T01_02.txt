I gazed upon the dispatch-box, a simple thing of leather and brass, yet its contents were of such a singular and perilous nature that my hand trembled to touch the lock. Within lay not mere correspondence, but the distilled anxieties of an Empire; a few scrawled words, a ciphered cable from some distant legation—these trifles could, if mishandled, set the Continent ablaze or send good men to their graves without their ever knowing why. To possess such foreknowledge is a damnable thing, for it isolates a man from his fellows more completely than any prison wall. They chat of markets and the weather, their minds untroubled by the precipice upon which they so blithely stand, whilst I must weigh each casual word, lest some unguarded syllable betray the colossal secret I am condemned to carry. It is a burden, indeed, which presses upon the soul until one fears it might crack under the strain.
