The man brought his fist down upon the mahogany table with such force that the very cutlery jumped, and I saw a woman two seats away start in alarm. “Do not speak to me of the Law!” he boomed to his companion, a thin, anxious-looking fellow who shrank from the outburst. “What has the Law done for poor Mister Ames, eh? Ruined, sir, utterly ruined by that scoundrel, and what is the official remedy? A paltry fine and a wagging finger! You speak of an eye for an eye as if it were some brutish, savage creed; I call it a most precise and necessary equation! When the constabulary and the courts prove themselves to be but a faulty mechanism, a thinking man has not only the right but, indeed, the solemn duty to become his own instrument of correction. It is not a matter of passion, but of cold, hard arithmetic—a debt has been created, and a debt must, by some means or other, be paid in full.”
