It was upon a clamorous thoroughfare, choked with the afternoon traffic of hansoms and carts, that I observed a gentleman in the most extraordinary predicament. This individual, a man of timid aspect with a nervous twitch to his moustache, was being roundly berated by a flower-girl of formidable dimensions, who accused him of having deliberately and with malice aforethought frightened her prize terrier. His protestations of innocence were quite lost in the general din, though his expression of pure, unadulterated perplexity was a spectacle in itself. The brute in question, a small and frankly corpulent dog, sat observing the proceedings with an air of supreme indifference, lending no credence whatsoever to its owner’s dramatic claims. The charge was so patently absurd, and the accused so hopelessly unequal to the task of defending his honour against such a vocal onslaught, that the entire scene took on the quality of a rather poorly-staged farce, much to the delight of the assembled loiterers.
