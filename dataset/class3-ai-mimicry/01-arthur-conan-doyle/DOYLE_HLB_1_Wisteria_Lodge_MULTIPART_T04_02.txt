You speak of the courts, my dear fellow, and you urge me to place my faith in a system that has already proven itself a hollow mockery. I have watched that villain—that monster in a gentleman’s coat—walk free from a courtroom where his guilt was as plain as the daylight, his escape purchased by a purse far heavier than any truth I could present. What is the law, then, but a commodity to be bought by the highest bidder? You ask me to stand by while he sups and laughs, his hands stained with my family’s ruin? No, sir. There are certain offences so heinous, and certain failures of justice so absolute, that they call for a more ancient and direct form of reckoning. When the King’s law proves impotent, a man is thrown back upon a more fundamental one, and it is by that grim standard that this final account shall be settled.
