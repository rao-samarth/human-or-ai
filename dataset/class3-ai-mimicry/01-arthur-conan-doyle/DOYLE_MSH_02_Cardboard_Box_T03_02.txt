You ask, my dear friend, how I could possibly have known the stationer was our man, and I must confess your astonishment is a greater mystery to me than the crime itself. Scotland Yard blundered, as is their custom, by searching for grand motives and theatrical clues—a missing will, a secret liaison! They are like men searching for a comet with a magnifying glass. The entire solution, you see, was writ plain upon the victim’s own correspondence: a single, miniscule blot of a peculiar cerulean ink, a shade sold by only one vendor in this part of the city. To the official force, it was a meaningless smudge, a trifle to be ignored. Yet it is upon such trifles that the entire architecture of a case is built. They saw the ink, but they did not *observe* it; and that, I assure you, has made all the difference.
