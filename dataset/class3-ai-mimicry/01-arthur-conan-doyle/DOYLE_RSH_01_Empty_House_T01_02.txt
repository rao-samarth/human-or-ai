Pray, moderate the indignation which so contorts your features; we are not unobserved here, and your outburst will attract the most unwelcome sort of attention. You profess a shock which, I confess, I find singularly naive. Did you truly imagine that a man hounded from his own country, with a price upon his very existence, could walk these streets under his own name and colours without employing some small, necessary contrivance? The very bread you ate this morning was purchased by funds secured through this elaborate falsehood you now so roundly condemn. Veracity, my dear friend, is a luxury for the safe and the secure. For men in my unfortunate position, it is a fatal indulgence; a direct path to the gallows from which this supposed villainy has so far preserved me—and, by extension, you.
