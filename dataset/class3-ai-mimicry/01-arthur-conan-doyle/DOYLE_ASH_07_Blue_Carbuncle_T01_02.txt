My friend, his face half-shrouded by the flickering gaslight, fell silent, having delivered his rather startling verdict upon the matter. I confess that every instinct within me—every principle instilled by a lifetime of adhering to the letter of the statute—cried out in protest. To allow this wretched fellow, this proven miscreant, to simply vanish into the London fog seemed a gross affront to the very foundations of our ordered society. And yet, as I studied my companion’s resolute expression, I perceived a logic more profound than any found within the dusty tomes of jurisprudence. Was there not a higher court, a tribunal of the human heart, whose statutes were not written in ink but in the terrible sum of a life's suffering and the faint possibility of redemption? He had weighed the man’s character, not merely his crime, and had passed a sentence of his own. The law would have provided a crude, unthinking retribution; my friend had offered a chance, however slim, for a soul to be remade. It was a staggering gamble, one which left the rigid certainties of the constabulary looking pale indeed.
