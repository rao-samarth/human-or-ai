Inspector Davies slapped the crumpled note upon the table with a frustrated hand. “It is pure gibberish, I tell you! ‘Three steps from the blind man’s watch.’ There was no blind man at the scene, and not a single timepiece was found upon the victim!” My companion, however, merely retrieved the paper, smoothing it with an almost reverential calm. “You mistake a poetic flourish for a literal instruction, Inspector,” he observed, his voice steady. “The mind we pursue thinks in symbols, not in facts. He does not refer to a man, but to a fixture—perchance a statue, like that of Justice, so often depicted with her eyes covered? And her ‘watch’ would not be a mechanical device, but her constant, unseeing vigil over the courtyard below. The puzzle is not in the words themselves, but in the chain of reasoning they are designed to ignite within a mind capable of seeing past the obvious.”
