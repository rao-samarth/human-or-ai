You may perceive me, sir, as a man for whom sentiment holds little currency, and in most matters you would be correct. When Mr. Aldridge found himself in that most dreadful of predicaments, with the wolves of finance at his very door and his good name dragged through the mire, every sensible voice urged me to step aside. I was advised, and most strenuously so, to sever all connection—to let the crumbling edifice fall whilst I myself stood clear of the ruin. And yet, a compact forged over thirty years in the face of common struggle is not a thing to be sundered by mere convenience or the counsel of lesser men. To have abandoned him at that singular moment would have been an act of profound self-betrayal, for what, I ask you, is a man’s worth if not the sum of his allegiances when the storm is at its height? I simply could not do it; my own honour forbade the act.
