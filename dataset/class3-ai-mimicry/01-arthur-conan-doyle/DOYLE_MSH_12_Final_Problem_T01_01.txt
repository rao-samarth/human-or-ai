I observed my travelling companion, a fellow whose intentions were no doubt admirable, engaged in a most desperate contest with a simple touring map. It was a singular spectacle—a conflict not merely of man versus paper, but of methodical reason against a kind of primordial, destructive impulse. He twisted it; he folded it upon entirely incorrect creases; he sought, with a bewildering and brutish force, to compel its submission into a shape for which it was never designed by any rational geographer. To witness such a fundamental disregard for the established principles of geometry was a profound trial for my nerves. Every crinkle and tear inflicted upon that innocent parchment was a small victory for the forces of anarchy that forever threaten the bulwarks of our civilised world. I found my hand twitching, my mind racing with the proper sequence of folds, yet I remained motionless, for it seemed a crucial experiment to see whether sheer, unthinking chaos could ever, by its own merits, triumph over inherent order.
