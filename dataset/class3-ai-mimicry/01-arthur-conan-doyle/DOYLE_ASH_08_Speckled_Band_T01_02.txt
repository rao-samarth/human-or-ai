I have observed, in my time, that a man’s ruin is seldom the product of a single, calamitous error; rather, it is the logical end-point of a flaw cultivated over many years. Take the matter of Silas Croft, whose financial empire has now collapsed into little more than dust and recrimination. Here was a man who possessed a keen and formidable intellect for the market, yet he allowed his ambition to fester into a sort of fever, a desperate and insatiable hunger for more. He began to see his fellows not as partners, but as obstacles, and his ventures not as constructions, but as conquests. It is an old and lamentable story, for when a man seeks to grasp everything within his reach, he invariably overextends his position, and the very structure he so painstakingly built becomes the instrument of his own, inevitable descent into oblivion.
