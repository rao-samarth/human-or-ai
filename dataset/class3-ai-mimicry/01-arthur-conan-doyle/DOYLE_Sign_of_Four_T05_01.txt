I see you gathered in this grand hall and I have no doubt that you perceive naught but the final, bitter chapter of a family’s decline, attributing our ruin to greed, to pride, or to the simple failings of character which afflict all men. Yet I say to you now that the true sickness which has blighted this house for a generation stems not from any open quarrel, but from the crushing weight of a single unspoken thing—a silence maintained with such ferocious loyalty that it became a more destructive force than any blade. It was a poison in our wine, a canker at the root of our name; it fostered suspicion where there should have been trust and turned every minor disagreement into a mortal wound. We were not enemies, you understand. We were merely strangers, each of us haunted by the ghost of a truth that no one dared confront, and so we built our resentments upon an edifice of utter falsehood.
