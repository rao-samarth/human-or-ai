In a provincial community such as this, where every soul is known to every other, the commission of a grave offence invariably excites the passions to a fever pitch. Tongues wag, suspicions fly like sparks from a blacksmith's forge, and a hundred fanciful theories are born of mere gossip and prejudice. Yet, the truth is seldom a matter of passion; it is, rather, a cold and quiet thing, assembled from a series of minute and often overlooked facts. The observer who wishes to unravel such a knot must first discard the entire emotional narrative spun by the townsfolk. He must approach the problem not as a human drama, but as a mechanical puzzle whose components have been scattered. A scuff upon a boot-heel, the particular species of mud on a trouser cuff, the time a clock was observed to have stopped—these are the true cogs and levers. From these, and these alone, a logical chain may be forged, and the entire machinery of the event laid bare for inspection.
