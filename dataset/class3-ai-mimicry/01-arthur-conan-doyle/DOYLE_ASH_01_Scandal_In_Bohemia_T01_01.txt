It is a spectacle of the highest comedy, I find, to observe a man of supposed genius attempt to reduce the human condition to a mere algebraic formula. Here, amidst the clatter of silver and the drone of polite conversation, stood Sir Eustace Finch, holding forth upon the immutable laws of social dynamics as if he were explaining the orbit of a planet. He spoke of predictable patterns and rational self-interest, all whilst young Lady Croft was blatantly arranging an assignation with a captain of the guards under the very nose of her corpulent husband, a feat of pure, unadulterated impulse. Sir Eustace, in his magnificent intellectual vacuum, saw only the clockwork; he was entirely blind to the chaotic, passionate, and utterly illogical humanity that truly fuels the machine. One might as well attempt to chart the path of a lightning bolt with a ruler and protractor—an exercise in supreme arrogance, proving nothing save the profound limitations of the mind which attempts it.
