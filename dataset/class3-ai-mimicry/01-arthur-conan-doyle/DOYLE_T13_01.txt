His voice, a booming baritone accustomed to commanding attention, filled the drawing-room as he gestured with a dismissive hand towards a map he had unfurled upon the table. It was then that his niece, a quiet girl hitherto occupied with her needlepoint, ventured a small correction—a simple, factual observation concerning the longitude of a certain forgotten port, supported by a reference she quietly produced from a nearby bookshelf. The effect was quite remarkable.
