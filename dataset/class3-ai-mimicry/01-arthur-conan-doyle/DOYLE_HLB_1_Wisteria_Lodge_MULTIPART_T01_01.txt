Observe yonder gentleman by the window, the one affecting such an air of placid prosperity. A fine coat, you will note, and a watch-chain of no inconsiderable weight. He would have us believe, I have no doubt, that his fortune was built upon shrewd investments and the patient accumulation of capital. A pretty fiction, is it not? Yet mark the way his left hand trembles when he lifts his cup; see how his eyes, in a moment of repose, betray a certain hunted quality, as though he expects a bailiff to burst through the door at any moment. You may plaster over a rot-hole with fine wallpaper, my dear fellow, but the decay beneath continues its work unabated. Men fancy they can bury their old sins under a mountain of gold, but they merely erect a more conspicuous monument to them; a monument from which, sooner or later, the original foulness is bound to seep through for all the world to see.
