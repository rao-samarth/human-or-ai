It is a singular thing, as I sit here by the dwindling fire, to contemplate the curious architecture of a man’s public standing. I have seen men face down ruin and physical peril with a stoicism one can only admire; yet, I have seen others, men of supposed iron will, crumble into a state of near madness over the threat of some trifling social embarrassment. Consider the case of that fellow from the City—you know of whom I speak. The desperate, almost frantic, energy he expended to conceal a youthful folly was a thing to behold. It was not the act itself he feared, but the shadow it might cast upon the immaculate edifice of his name. For such men, the substance of their character is of little account next to the polish of its exterior; they would sooner risk their fortune, and perhaps their very life, than suffer the indignity of being thought merely foolish. It is a strange and telling priority, indeed.
