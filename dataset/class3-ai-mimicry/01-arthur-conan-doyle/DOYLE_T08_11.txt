You look upon this matter and see only a neat and tidy conclusion, a final entry in the great ledger of the constabulary. Indeed, the law has had its say; it has weighed the facts with its cold, impartial hands and delivered a verdict which society deems sufficient. But I ask you to consider the immense gulf which separates that dispassionate decree from the raw, elemental craving for equilibrium which drove the aggrieved party to act. Was that a simple hunger for vengeance, as the prosecutor so eloquently argued, or was it a more primitive and perhaps more honest form of settlement? The impersonal machinery of this great metropolis has rendered its judgment, yet I am left to wonder whether a true account has been settled, or if we have merely witnessed the exchange of one wrong for another, sanctioned by wigs and gowns.
