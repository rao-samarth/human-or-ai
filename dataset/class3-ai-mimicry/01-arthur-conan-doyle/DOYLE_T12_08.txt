The house slept, a great beast of timber and stone, yet I alone remained awake, my mind a most turbulent sea. Before me, upon the polished mahogany of the desk, lay the codicil—a mere slip of paper, yet one possessing the singular power to reshape a fortune, to correct what I have long perceived as an egregious and undeserved slight. A simple flick of the wrist, a touch of the flame from this very candle, and the thing would be gone; its inconvenient directives reduced to naught but ash and smoke. A man of stricter principles, of a more rigid moral fibre, would have recoiled from the very notion.

What, after all, is a single sheet of foolscap when weighed against a lifetime of security and standing? It is upon such a razor’s edge, between what is lawful and what is merely advantageous, that a man’s true character is laid bare, and I confess with some alarm that I felt my own footing begin to slip.
