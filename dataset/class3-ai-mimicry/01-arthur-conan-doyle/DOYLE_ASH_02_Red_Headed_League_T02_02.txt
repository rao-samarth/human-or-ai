From my vantage point in the corner of the bustling tea-house, I observed a curious little drama unfold between two gentlemen at an adjacent table. The first, a lean, nervous individual with the furtive eyes of a ferret, was presenting a small, grimy box to his companion—a portly man whose florid complexion deepened with every whispered word. The object of their negotiation, which I could just glimpse, appeared to be a desiccated canary, artfully wrapped in what looked suspiciously like tea-stained linen. The swindler, for he could be nothing else, spoke in hushed, urgent tones of its provenance; the victim, meanwhile, was deaf to all but the siren call of an impossible bargain. His entire being was consumed not by the artefact’s dubious history, but by its imagined price at auction. The transaction was concluded with a rapidity that should have aroused suspicion in any but the most covetous mind, proving yet again that the most effective picklock for a man’s purse is his own insatiable desire for more.
