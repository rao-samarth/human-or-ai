It was a most singular spectacle to observe Sir Alistair Finch holding court by the conservatory doors, a man whose name, not a decade prior, would have been met with a distinct chill in any respectable drawing-room. His fortune, amassed through some rather grim industrial dealings that had beggared one county to enrich his own coffers, was of a magnitude that simply could not be ignored; indeed, it possessed a gravitational pull all its own.

They fawned upon him, these scions of ancient houses, their principles dissolving with each sip of the man’s outrageously expensive claret. He had, it was quite clear, made a calculated exchange of a gentleman's good name for a king's ransom, and upon viewing the desperate adulation in the eyes of his new companions, one could not but conclude that he considered the bargain a most advantageous one.
