I was occupying a small table at the Criterion, observing the curious pageant of humanity, when my attention was drawn to a most unfortunate gentleman of prodigious girth holding forth to a rather unimpressed companion. “It requires, you understand, a certain unflinching character,” he was booming, his face florid with self-satisfaction, “a moral fibre which does not yield to transient pressures!” At this precise moment, a wiry little fellow with a newspaper, seated two tables away, looked up over his spectacles. “Is that the same fibre you displayed during the great Pidding-on-the-Wold egg fiasco, Abernathy?” he enquired with a piercing clarity. “I recall you taking refuge in a baptismal font.” A wave of apoplectic purple washed over the large man’s countenance; he sputtered, attempting to pivot to some other grand endeavour, but the damage was quite plainly done. One may construct a new façade with the greatest of care, but it is a confoundedly difficult business to silence the architects of the old one, especially when they possess a long memory and a distinct lack of social inhibition.
