My dear friend, you must pay no mind to the sensational whispers circulating through this ballroom, for they are the product of minds which prefer fantasy to fact. The affair of the Duchess’s vanishing emerald is, I grant you, a most singular occurrence, yet it is by no means the work of some spectral thief, as the more excitable guests would have you believe. Observe the draft from that open conservatory door and the peculiar tremor in the crystal chandelier above the display case; note also the fine silk thread, all but invisible, which the dowager yonder has just discreetly wound about her fan. The world is not so full of ghosts as it is of clever, and sometimes desperate, individuals. Before one theorises upon the supernatural, one must first exhaust the entirely natural—a principle which, if more widely applied, would save a great deal of astonishment and leave very little room for phantoms to conduct their mischief.
