You carry it off poorly, my dear Lord Ashworth; a man of your supposed station should command his features with a greater artistry. You believe, no doubt, that by standing here amidst the music and chatter, your petty treason is adequately concealed. Yet the facts arrange themselves with a most unforgiving clarity. That faint, violet-hued stain upon your right cuff—ah, you start!—is from the very ink used exclusively for the Admiralty’s private communiqués, an ink which has no business being anywhere but upon sealed documents. Couple this with the nervous manner in which you thrice consulted your watch only when the Russian attaché was in your line of sight, and your otherwise inexplicable interest in the potted ferns near the conservatory door—the pre-arranged point of exchange, I presume? The entire shabby affair is as plain to me as the pattern on this carpet. Pray, do not bother with indignation; it is a most unconvincing performance.
