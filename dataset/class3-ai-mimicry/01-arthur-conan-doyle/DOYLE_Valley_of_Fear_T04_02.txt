I find this country air, after the perpetual smoke of the city, most clarifying to the mind. Take the recent affair of old McGregor and the land dispute; he insisted he sought only the law’s dispassionate satisfaction—a simple balancing of the scales. Yet, I observed in his eye a certain fire, a gleam of stark triumph that spoke less of societal order and more of a deeply personal victory. It is a most perilous distinction, is it not? That precise moment at which a righteous claim for restitution curdles into a baser, more venomous appetite for another’s ruin. The law, you see, should be a precise instrument; but when a man wields it merely to settle a private score, its clean edge is invariably sullied. One pursues an abstract principle, the other a festering wound, and though their paths may appear identical for a time, I assure you their destinations are worlds apart.
