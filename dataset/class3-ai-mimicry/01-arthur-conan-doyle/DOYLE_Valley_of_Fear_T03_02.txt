I watched the fellow from my seat by the window, a man whose entire posture screamed of a life lived in the shadows of another. He moved through the throng of the city with a hunted look, his eyes darting from face to face, not in search of an acquaintance, but rather in mortal dread of finding one. Such a game is a fool's errand, for this metropolis is at once a grand hiding place and a merciless trap. A man may believe he can maintain two wholly separate spheres of action, but the constant strain of it becomes a poison. It is a perilous balancing act upon a wire stretched over a chasm of discovery; the frantic effort to keep one foot from betraying the other is, I should think, a far greater torment than the eventual, and inevitable, disgrace itself. The soul, you see, cannot be so neatly partitioned without cracks beginning to show in the foundation of the whole man.
