You speak of the financial loss, Albright, as if that were the chief matter of concern, but you and I know it to be a mere trifle when set against the true wreckage. It is the shattering of a man's own estimation of himself that proves the fatal blow—the sudden, chilling realisation that the intellect upon which he has staked his entire career is, after all, fallible. It is not the empty coffers that keep you staring so fixedly into the passing darkness of the fen, is it? No, it is the hollowing out of your own certainty, the ghost of your former confidence which now mocks you from every reflective surface of this rattling carriage. That, my dear fellow, is a bankruptcy from which there is seldom any recovery, for the chief creditor is one’s own soul, and it is a most unforgiving master indeed.
