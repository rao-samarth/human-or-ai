I observed the new junior clerk, Mr Abernathy, with a certain clinical interest, for his distress was quite palpable. He fumbled with his ledgers, his face the colour of old parchment, and I knew at once the precise cause of his malady. It was, of course, the unfortunate matter of the forged reference which I had uncovered upon his hiring some weeks prior—a trifling deceit which, in a moment of misguided charity, I had elected to overlook. Now, however, the firm’s senior partner was making his rounds, and the poor fellow’s guilty conscience had plainly got the better of him. He imagines, no doubt, that every footstep in the corridor signals his imminent exposure. It is a common enough phenomenon; a man may bury a misdeed with considerable success, but he fails to account for the fact that he has interred it in his own mind, from which there is, in the final analysis, no escape. The ghost is of his own making, and it will haunt him far more terribly than any living accuser ever could.
