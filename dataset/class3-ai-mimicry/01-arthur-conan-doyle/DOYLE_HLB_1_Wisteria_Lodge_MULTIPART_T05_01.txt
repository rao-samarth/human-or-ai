You are correct in your surmise; it was I who passed the dispatch to the Baron’s secretary. Whilst the orchestra played its Viennese waltz and our own ministers made their pleasantries, I perceived the gravity of the situation—a gravity entirely lost upon men whose minds are concerned only with canapés and courtly gossip. The attaché from the Prussian legation was a known firebrand, his intentions anything but pacific; to have allowed that particular cypher to reach his government would have been to light the very fuse of a continental war. My action, therefore—though you may now brand it a betrayal of my post—was in truth a betrayal of one minor confidence to preserve a hundred thousand lives. I weighed my duty to my office against my duty to the Crown’s lasting peace, and I did not for a moment hesitate in my choice. England, sir, would have paid a far dearer price for my silence.
