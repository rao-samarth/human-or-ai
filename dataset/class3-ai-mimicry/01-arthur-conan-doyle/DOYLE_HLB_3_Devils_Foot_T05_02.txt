There is, I have long observed, no catalyst for human action so potent nor so perilous as a devotion that has been grievously wronged. It is a force of nature, which, like a river dammed, must perforce find a new and more violent channel for its expression. I recall the matter of Finch, a junior underwriter of quiet and methodical habit, whose entire being was centred upon his affection for a certain young lady. When he was betrayed, not only in his professional ambitions but in this more sacred matter, by a cunning and ruthless senior partner, the change in the fellow was a remarkable thing to witness. All the meticulous energy he had once applied to calculating risk was now turned upon a single objective: the complete and utter ruin of his tormentor. It was not a matter of sudden passion, you understand, but a cold, calculated, and terrifyingly patient campaign, proving that the same profound sentiment which can build a life is quite capable, when soured, of orchestrating its most absolute destruction.
