Mr. Abernathy—for so he now styled himself—had purchased the small dale with its tumbling brook for the express purpose of forgetting. He had imagined that the study of orchids and the quiet contemplation of the shifting seasons would scrub clean the slate of a mind long etched with the ciphers and stratagems of the city. Yet, the old faculties, honed to a razor's sharpness by years of perilous calculation, would not be so easily blunted upon the soft stone of country life. As he stood upon his lawn, observing the simple flight of a chaffinch, he found himself deducing the angle of its ascent and the probable velocity of the wind which aided it, his thoughts moving with a grim and automatic precision. The man who had been was a phantom at his elbow, a constant and unwelcome companion who whispered of probabilities and motives when all Abernathy wished to hear was the drone of the bees amongst his lavender. It was a most singular and trying form of haunting, to be shadowed not by a ghost, but by the implacable logic of one's own former existence.
