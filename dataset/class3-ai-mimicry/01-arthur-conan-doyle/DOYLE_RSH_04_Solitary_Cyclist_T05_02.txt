My dear sister remarked upon the profound peace of her country estate, and indeed, as the firelight danced across the contented faces of our family, one could hardly disagree. Yet my own gaze was drawn to the window, where the last vestiges of twilight sank behind the desolate, rolling hills. It has always struck me that such profound quiet is a double-edged sword; whilst it may soothe the placid soul, it offers a most dreadful incubator for the brooding or unbalanced mind. With no neighbour for a mile in any direction, no sudden cry for help could ever be heard, and no strange light in a window would ever be marked. A man might descend into any manner of madness or vice out there in the silent darkness, with only the stooping trees and the indifferent stars for witnesses to his grim transformation. The city, for all its squalor, at least provides the check of a thousand watching eyes.
