You speak of a fresh start, my dear fellow, and of casting off your old life as a man might a worn-out coat, yet you fail to perceive the one immutable truth of our condition. You may change your name, your lodgings, your very circle of acquaintances, but the deed itself remains a fixed point in time, unaltered and unalterable. It is not some common creditor from whom you can flee by taking the midnight train to the continent; rather, it is a peculiar sort of ghost that asks for no chains and makes no sound. Nevertheless, it follows at your heel more faithfully than any hound, waiting with infinite patience for that single, unguarded moment. That business in the country, I tell you, is not concluded; it is merely dormant, and I very much fear it will awaken at the most inopportune time imaginable.
