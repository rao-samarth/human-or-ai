Amidst the glittering crush of the Ambassador’s ball, any eye of discernment might easily separate the wheat from the chaff—the genuine celebrants from those with a graver purpose. You see them, do you not? Three men, positioned with almost geometric precision along the far wall, their countenances utterly impassive amidst the general mirth. The casual observer might dismiss them as mere footmen or disenchanted guests, a trifling detail in the grand spectacle. Yet, I perceive a singular, unifying tension in their posture; a shared, unspoken communication that flows between them like a current. They are not here for the champagne or the waltz, of that I am certain. They form a silent, unbreachable perimeter around that unassuming dignitary by the ferns. It is a most curious form of guardianship, a web of vigilance disguised as ennui, and I should wager my entire reputation that their charge has not the slightest inkling of the invisible cage in which he so merrily converses.
