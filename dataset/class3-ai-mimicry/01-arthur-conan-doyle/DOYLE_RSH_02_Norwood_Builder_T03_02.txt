It is a most peculiar study, this provincial capacity for preserving an injury. In the city, a man’s animosities are fleeting, lost in the great torrent of humanity; but here, in the quiet backwaters of Upton Magna, a grievance is treated as a family heirloom, passed down with greater care than the silverware. Consider the feud between the miller and the vicar—a quarrel whose origins are now entirely obscured by the mists of time, yet which flourishes with undiminished vigour. The vicar preaches on the sin of avarice with a pointed stare, and the miller, in turn, grinds his flour so exceedingly fine that it is said to choke the parsonage pigeons. What magnificent purpose! To dedicate one’s entire lineage to the systematic annoyance of another, all for a slight so ancient that its particulars are known only to the churchyard stones. It is a spectacle of such monumental pettiness that it almost achieves a certain grandeur.
