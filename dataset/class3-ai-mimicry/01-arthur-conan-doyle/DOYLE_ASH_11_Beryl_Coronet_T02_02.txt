From our table in the corner of a crowded lyceum café, my companion drew my attention to a nearby pair. An older gentleman, with a severe countenance and a rather formidable brow, was speaking in low, urgent tones to a youth whose shoulders were slumped in what seemed to be abject dejection. "A cruel dismissal, I should wager," my friend whispered, "the boy has plainly been found wanting." Indeed, every outward sign pointed to a dressing-down of the most merciless sort. Yet, as the elder man leaned forward, his voice rose just enough for us to perceive not anger, but a singular, impassioned plea. He was coaching the lad, imploring him to find the fire for an upcoming oratorical contest, his stern expression merely the mask of a tutor utterly devoted to his student's success. It serves as a fine reminder that the human heart is not always so easily read, and that what appears as the shadow of malice may well be the intense, hopeful light of mentorship cast in an unexpected form.
