He then took a seat, and by his gentle manner, it was plain he sought not to fleece the poor fellow, but to fortify his spirit. Here was a man who perceived the same weakness, the same opportunity, yet his gain was of a different order entirely: the simple, profound satisfaction of steering a foundering ship back toward a safe harbour.
