It was a singular thing, indeed, to witness such a profound and private reconciliation played out against the clamorous backdrop of the public square. The young man’s countenance, heretofore a mask of youthful arrogance, was now a study in abject contrition; his confession, delivered in a low and fractured tone, had stripped him of all artifice. His sister, who by every right ought to have turned from him in righteous fury, instead regarded him with a steady and discerning eye, her gaze cutting through the artless squalor of his excuses to the genuine remorse that lay beneath. For a long moment she did not speak, allowing the din of the omnibuses and the cries of the vendors to fill the chasm between them. Then, with a quiet resolution that bespoke a strength far greater than his own, she placed a gloved hand upon his trembling arm. The wound, though grievous, was not mortal, and I saw in that simple gesture the first careful suture being laid, a sign that a foundation so shaken might yet be rebuilt upon the solid ground of forgiveness.
