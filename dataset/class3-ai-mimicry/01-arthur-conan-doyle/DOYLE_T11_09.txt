My dear fellow, your democratic spirit is a fine thing in theory, but in practice it has just caused that poor manufacturer to perspire clean through his collar. You greeted him with the easy warmth one reserves for a fellow clubman, and yet the man was manifestly aghast. Did you not perceive it? His fortune, though formidable, is barely a decade old, and its origins lie in something so deplorably useful as galvanised tin. He wears his evening dress like a suit of borrowed armour, and his desperate attempts to hold his fork correctly are a study in concentrated misery. To treat such a man with breezy familiarity is not a kindness; it is a cruelty, for it highlights the very chasm you pretend does not exist. You have not put him at his ease, I assure you; you have merely reminded him, in the most public manner possible, that he has not the faintest notion of how a gentleman is meant to behave.
