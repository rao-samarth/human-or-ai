From the window of the cab, the great thoroughfare presented its usual chaotic symphony of sound and motion, yet our attention was drawn to a small knot of onlookers gathered about a man of some means, whose respectable tailoring and sonorous voice commanded a certain authority. He stood upon a crate, exhorting the crowd with great feeling upon the subject of public charity and the solemn duty of every citizen to aid those souls lost in the mire of poverty. It was a fine speech, full of noble sentiment. Just then, a small, grimy-faced urchin, seeing in this well-dressed gentleman a potential benefactor, dared to tug at the hem of his coat, a silent plea in his wide eyes. The orator, interrupted in his grandiloquent flight, paused only to shake the lad off with a gesture of profound irritation, muttering some sharp reproof concerning the insolence of the city’s beggars before resuming his sermon. It was a most instructive little drama: a man so entirely consumed with the abstract principle of benevolence that he had quite failed to recognise its practical application when it stood, quite literally, at his feet.
