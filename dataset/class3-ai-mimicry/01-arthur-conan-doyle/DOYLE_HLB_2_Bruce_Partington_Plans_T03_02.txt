Our mad dash through the benighted countryside was one of considerable urgency, the coachman thrashing his horses to a frantic gallop. Inside, the carriage rocked violently upon the pitted road, yet Colonel Abernathy remained a bastion of military calm—a stout, reassuring figure whose boisterous tales of the frontier had been our sole comfort for many a league. He laughed at some jest, his hand resting easy upon his knee. Then came the ambush. A sudden, jarring halt threw us against the partitions as a volley of shots rang out in the darkness. Instantly, my companion’s eyes, sharp as a hawk’s, fixed not upon the darkened road ahead, but upon the Colonel himself. I followed his gaze. In that split second of chaos, Abernathy’s hand had not flown to the revolver at his belt, as any soldier’s instinct would dictate; rather, his fingers had darted towards the latch of a small signalling lantern tucked inside his greatcoat. His bluff smile never wavered, but for a fleeting moment, a flicker of cold calculation in his eyes betrayed the entire damnable charade.
