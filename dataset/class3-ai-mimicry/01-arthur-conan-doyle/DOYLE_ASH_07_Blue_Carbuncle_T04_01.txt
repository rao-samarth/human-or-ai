It was a most singular affair, and yet the solution, once perceived, was of an almost laughable simplicity. The constable pointed to the scuffed floorboards and the unlatched window as manifest signs of a common housebreaker, but my attention was drawn elsewhere; to wit, the faint, webbed print upon the topmost shelf, a place no human foot could readily access without the ladder which remained undisturbed against the far wall. Consider, in addition, the single, downy feather I discovered clinging to the preserves jar—not of a chicken, mind you, but of the *Anser anser domesticus*, the common Greylag. Hence, the evidence pointed not to a two-legged thief of the human persuasion, but to a feathered one of considerable cunning and a prodigious appetite for damson plum. I fancy if you were to inspect the vicar’s prize bird, you would find its bill to be remarkably sticky and its conscience—if such a creature possesses one—entirely untroubled by its midnight larceny.
