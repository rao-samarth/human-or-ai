The constable, a man whose intellect was as broad as the high street on market day, held up the muddy boot as if it were the crown jewels. He pointed with a triumphant, grimy finger at the peculiar hobnail pattern, a pattern he had already declared to belong to young Thomas, the gardener’s boy. It was, indeed, a masterstroke of observation for a man of his calibre. Yet, as I watched the poor lad being led away, I could not help but reflect upon the very nature of such discoveries. A fact, you see, is a stubborn thing, but its placement is a matter of artistry. One might find it a simple matter to procure a certain boot, to press it firmly into the damp earth at just the right angle, and to then ‘stumble’ upon it at the opportune moment. The mind of the provincial official, so eager for a swift conclusion, will seize upon such a tangible clue and look no further; it is the cornerstone upon which a convenient and entirely fallacious narrative may be built with gratifying ease.
