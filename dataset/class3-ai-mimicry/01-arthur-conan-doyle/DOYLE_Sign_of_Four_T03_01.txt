Our train rattled onwards through a parched and dusty land, and as I gazed out upon the arid plains, I could not help but reflect upon the great works of my forefathers. Here was a railway, a feat of engineering, driven through the most unforgiving country; there, the distant glint of a reservoir, a marvel of our nation's skill. Yet, my companion, a man of more cynical disposition, gestured with his pipe towards the wretched hamlets we passed. "A fine monument to our enterprise, is it not?" he remarked, his voice devoid of warmth. "We gave them order, and for it we took their spirit. We built these great lines of iron, yet their fields lie fallow and their children go hungry." It was a singular and unsettling thought, for what right had we to impose our will, however well-intentioned, only to leave behind a hollowed-out people, dispossessed of their own history and future? The question hung in the carriage air, as heavy and oppressive as the afternoon sun.
