Amongst the glittering assembly at the Ambassador’s reception, there was no figure more apparently benign than that of Sir Reginald Croft. A portly gentleman of advancing years, his booming laughter and endless supply of well-worn anecdotes made him the gravitational centre of his small circle; indeed, he was the very picture of harmless, good-natured conviviality. Yet, to a discerning eye, there was a most singular discordance in his presentation. His eyes, small and astonishingly pale, never shared in the mirth of his mouth, but remained cold, watchful, and intensely analytical. One might also observe the peculiar manner in which his left hand, though seemingly at rest, never strayed far from the ornate silver head of his malacca cane, his knuckles white with a tension utterly at odds with his relaxed posture. It was the calm of the serpent in the grass, a creature whose placid exterior gives no warning of the venom which lies ready to be dispensed with shocking and fatal alacrity.
