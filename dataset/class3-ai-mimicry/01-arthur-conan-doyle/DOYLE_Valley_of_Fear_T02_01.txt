The oppressive dread which had for so long held our quiet parish in its grip had begun, at last, to recede, much as a fever breaks in the cool hours of the morning. A week ago, no sane man would have ventured forth after dusk, for the very shadows seemed to hold a malevolent watchfulness; yet now, I observed from my window the lamplighter making his rounds with a steady and untroubled gait. The change was palpable in the very air. Shutters, hitherto bolted fast, were thrown open to the spring sunshine, and the timid visage of a neighbour might be seen, offering a tentative greeting where before there had been only hurried, downward glances. It was a small beginning, to be sure, and the memory of that nocturnal fraternity and its brutal work would not soon be erased, but it was an auspicious one. Light and reason were returning to our streets, and with them, the simple, honest courage of common folk, which is, in the end, the most formidable bulwark against any creeping darkness.
