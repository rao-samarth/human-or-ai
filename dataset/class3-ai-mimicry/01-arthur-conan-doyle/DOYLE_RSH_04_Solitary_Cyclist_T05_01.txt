There is a peculiar sort of stillness which settles upon these outlying villages, a quietude which the city-dweller at first mistakes for peace. He soon learns, however, that it is not the peace of contentment, but rather the silence of secrets, a hush which falls over all earnest inquiry. Each cottage, set apart from its neighbour by a stretch of untended garden or a crumbling stone wall, becomes a tiny kingdom unto itself, governed by its own strange laws and private sorrows. Here, where a man may live his entire life without the daily inspection of his fellows, the mind is apt to turn inward, brooding upon old grievances and nursing singular notions until they blossom into the most dreadful and grotesque of realities. One sees the manifestation of it in the furtive glance of a passer-by, in the sudden shutting of a curtain as one approaches; it is a malady of the spirit, bred in loneliness and festering in the shadows of a seemingly idyllic landscape, more potent by far than any poison known to chemistry.
