I raise my glass this evening, not merely to the happy couple, but as a man compelled to bear witness before this assembly. I observe in them a bond of genuine affection, a treasure which I, in my own time, foolishly deemed secondary to matters of greater import—namely, the ceaseless acquisition of a fortune. For the sake of a controlling interest in the shipping line and the deed to the Blackwood estate, I set brother against brother and estranged my own dear wife; her heart, I can now state with the utmost certainty, was broken not by some sudden calamity but by the slow, corrosive action of my own insatiable avarice. My coffers swelled, it is true, but my house grew silent, its halls echoing only with the ghosts of lost affection and the bitter tally of what I had so carelessly thrown away. Let this occasion, therefore, serve as my public ledger: the inheritance I so ruthlessly secured has yielded nothing but a profound and solitary ruin, a lesson I impart with what little honour remains to me.
