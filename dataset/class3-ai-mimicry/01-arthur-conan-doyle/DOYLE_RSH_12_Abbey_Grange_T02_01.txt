You speak of bruises and broken bones, my friend, as if they were the only currency of cruelty! Good heavens, man, must you see the physical mark of the whip before you will acknowledge the lash? There is a brand of villainy, more refined and far more devilish, which breaks the spirit without ever soiling the skin. It is a slow poison, administered daily in the guise of affection; a meticulous dismantling of the will which leaves its victim a mere husk, trembling at a raised voice or a sudden shadow. I saw the aftermath of this very art in her vacant stare—not the work of a common brute, but of a cold and calculating fiend who has perfected his vile craft behind closed doors. You seek a crime, you say? Why, sir, this is the most profound of all, for it murders the very soul while the body is compelled to walk on.
