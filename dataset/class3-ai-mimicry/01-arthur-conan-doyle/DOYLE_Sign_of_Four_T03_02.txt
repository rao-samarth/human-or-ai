As I navigated the teeming thoroughfare that evening, a profound melancholy settled upon my spirit, for it was a city of ghosts living alongside men. One could not but observe the stark dichotomy: here, the grand and imposing facades of our own administration, their gas-lamps casting a civilised glow upon the pavement; and there, a mere stone's throw away, the wretched, unlit warrens wherein the city's original inhabitants were now confined. What grand pronouncements of progress and enlightenment could possibly justify this chasm of human experience? It struck me then with a dreadful and undeniable certainty that we had not, in truth, brought light to this place. Rather, we had merely erected a brighter cage, and in so doing, had sown a bitter seed in this foreign soil—a seed of resentment from which, I have no doubt, a terrible and vengeful harvest will one day be reaped by our children's children.
