I found myself quite unintentionally an auditor to a most peculiar matrimonial debate whilst taking my coffee at a small table near the window. The gentleman, a man of commerce by his dress and manner, had laid out a series of figures upon a slip of paper, demonstrating with what I must admit was unassailable proof why a certain venture ought to be abandoned at once. He spoke of diminishing returns, of market pressures, of the sheer, cold arithmetic of the situation, and I confess his reasoning was as sound as any I had ever heard. His wife, however, offered no counter-syllogism; she presented no alternative figures nor disputed his facts. She spoke only of a promise made to her late father, of a feeling of loyalty that she could not bring herself to betray. Her entire argument was built not upon a foundation of rock, but upon the shifting mists of sentiment, and yet—astoundingly—it won the day. The man sighed, crumpled the paper in his fist, and in that simple gesture, I witnessed the absolute surrender of a fortress of logic to a force against which it had no conceivable defence.
