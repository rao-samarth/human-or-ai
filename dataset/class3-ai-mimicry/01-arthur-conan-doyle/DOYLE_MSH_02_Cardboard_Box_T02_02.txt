In these quiet hamlets, where every curtain-twitch is a matter of public record, the human heart remains a vessel for the most tempestuous of passions. It was, therefore, no great surprise to any rational observer when the sordid affair of Mrs. Abernathy and the young vicar concluded in such a grim and final fashion behind the yew hedge of her own garden. One might as well expect a chemical combination to fail its reaction as to imagine such a blatant transgression could pass without its necessary and, I daresay, its just, precipitation. The constable, a man of simple intellect, speaks of foul play and seeks a culprit with a motive of base jealousy. I, however, see only the grim workings of a natural law, a violent correction of an imbalance that threatened the very fabric of our modest society. Some things, you see, are simply an equation demanding to be solved, and a life forfeit is but the final, logical sum.
