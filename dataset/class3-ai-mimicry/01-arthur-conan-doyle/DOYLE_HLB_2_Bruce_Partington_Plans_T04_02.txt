My dear friend, I write to you from this little market town, for a most perplexing and, I daresay, lamentable situation has arisen which I feel compelled to share. You may recall the local apothecary, a quiet and mild-mannered fellow by the name of Finch, whose greatest vice until now was a fondness for exceedingly pungent pipe tobacco. It is this very man whom our local constabulary, with a precipitous haste that borders upon the farcical, has charged with the recent burglary at the manor. The evidence, you see, amounts to little more than a single muddy boot-print found near the library window—a boot-print of a common and widely sold variety!—and the word of a notoriously unreliable gamekeeper. I have since spoken with the poor man, and I assure you that the look upon his face was not one of guilt, but of utter, helpless astonishment. It is a grievous error, my friend, and a stark reminder that a reputation built over a lifetime can be undone in a single morning by nothing more than baseless conjecture and official incompetence.
