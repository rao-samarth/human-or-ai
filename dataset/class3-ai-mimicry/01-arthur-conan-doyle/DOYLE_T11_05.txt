You quite put your foot in it, my dear fellow, when you commented upon the precise cost of Sir Reginald’s new carriage horses. One may remark upon their spirit, their fine lines, or even the polish on the harness; but to allude, however obliquely, to the vulgar matter of coin is a social solecism of the first water. It is the unspoken compact amongst those of a certain station that such matters of commerce are simply presumed, and to speak of them is to confess that you find them remarkable. You failed to perceive that Sir Reginald, for all his bluster, purchased his title not a decade ago with profits from ironworks—a fact betrayed by the faint, ineradicable stain of industry upon his fingernails. A true gentleman’s history is etched upon the worn leather of his grandfather’s chair, not tallied in a ledger. You mistook the loud jangling of new money for the quiet, assured hum of an ancient inheritance, a deucedly common error for the uninitiated.
