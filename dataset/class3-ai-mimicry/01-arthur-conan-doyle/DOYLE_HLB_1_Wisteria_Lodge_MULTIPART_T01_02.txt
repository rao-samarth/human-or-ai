You ask me, my dear fellow, why General Alistair Finch, a man celebrated in every London paper for his colonial victories, should present such a troubled countenance amidst this glittering assembly. It is a singular thing, is it not, that a man may build a prodigious reputation upon foundations of sheer brutality, and yet somehow expect his own soul to remain untroubled by the memory of the masonry? Pray, observe the manner in which his hand trembles upon his wine glass; it is not the palsy of age, I assure you, but the ceaseless tremor of a conscience which cannot be silenced by the weight of medals upon his breast. The phantoms of that dreadful business in the eastern territories, I suspect, are more vivid to him at this moment than all the fawning dignitaries who surround him. For you see, such bloody accounts are never truly settled, and the interest which accrues upon them is invariably a man’s own peace of mind.
