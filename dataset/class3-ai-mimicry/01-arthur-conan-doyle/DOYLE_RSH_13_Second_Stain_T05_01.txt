It was, I concede, a most singular and perilous course for the old Vicar to have taken, for the complete ruin of his good name seemed all but a certainty. Rather than await the inevitable poison of a leaked letter, he chose to stand before his simple congregation that Sunday and speak, not of brimstone, but of his own human frailty in a time long past. One might have anticipated a great scandal, a flurry of whispers which would sweep him from the pulpit and indeed from the county itself; yet what followed was a silence more profound and more telling than any prayer. In that quiet country church, the man’s bold honesty had accomplished what no denial ever could. He had transformed a weapon meant for his destruction into a shield, and in doing so, found that the esteem in which he was held had not been diminished, but was now fortified by a compassion he had never dared to expect.
