One might observe that the ruin of a community is a thing seldom perpetrated by an invading army, but more often by some insidious poison from within. So it was with Amberly Vale. I recall it as a place of simple fellowship, where the bonds between neighbours were the truest form of currency. Then came the whispers of a great quarry, of fortunes to be hewn from the hillside, and a fever took hold of the populace. It was a lamentable spectacle. Men who had once stood shoulder-to-shoulder now engaged in bitter disputes over boundaries and rights, their faces hardened by a covetous gleam. The laughter in the old inn was replaced by the hushed, anxious talk of shares and dividends. In their frantic scrabble for material gain, they succeeded only in tearing down the very edifice of their shared existence, leaving behind but a ghost of a town haunted by the spectres of broken trust and squandered goodwill.
