One looks out now upon the fields of old man Abernathy and sees only a ruin of churned mud and debris where, not a fortnight ago, the finest barley in the county grew. The river, in its dreadful fury, was purposefully diverted across his property, and by this singular act of foresight our little hamlet was spared a most certain and catastrophic inundation. He did not hesitate, I am told, but took up the spade himself, knowing full well that his own livelihood would be washed away in the torrent he thereby unleashed. What a remarkable thing it is, that a man should so willingly surrender his own prosperity for the sake of his neighbours! It gives one a profound sense of hope for our prospects, for it demonstrates a foundational goodness in the human spirit, a quality of quiet fortitude which ensures that, come what may, the community as a whole shall endure and, in time, flourish once more.
