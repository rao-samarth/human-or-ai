The little man, whose name was now of no consequence to anyone, had congratulated himself upon the singular ingenuity of his contrivance. It was a thing of delicate clockwork and sinister purpose, designed to operate amidst the clamour of the city streets with the precision of a surgeon’s scalpel. He had accounted for every variable, or so his vanity assured him; the jostling of the crowd, the rumble of the omnibuses, the very thickness of the November fog which shrouded his movements. Yet, in his meticulous planning, he had neglected one small, but entirely fatal, detail: the powerful magnetic field generated by the new electrical tramway, the very symbol of progress he so despised. The delicate, magnetised needle of his own infernal machine, meant to trigger upon proximity to his target's iron gate, was drawn irrevocably astray by the passing carriage. A sharp hiss, a plume of acrid smoke visible only to him, and the architect of a diabolical plot fell amidst the unheeding throngs, a victim not of some brilliant pursuer, but of the cold, impartial logic of his own wicked design.
