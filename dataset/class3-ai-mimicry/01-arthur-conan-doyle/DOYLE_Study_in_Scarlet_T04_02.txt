Within the grand hall, amidst the shimmer of gaslight on crystal and the low murmur of polite society, one might have presumed to find nothing but untroubled contentment. Yet, even here, a discerning eye could perceive the faint, almost imperceptible cracks in the polished veneer. A lady’s fan might flutter not with coquetry but with a nervous agitation that betrayed a spirit ill at ease; a gentleman’s laugh, though hearty, could end a fraction too abruptly, revealing the hollow space behind it. It is a profound and somber consideration, this universal masquerade. Each smile becomes a carefully constructed fortress, each pleasantry a sentry guarding some private, unutterable sorrow. Indeed, the most elaborate disguises are worn not by villains in the dark, but by ordinary men and women in the brightest of rooms, who fear nothing more than the dismal prospect of being truly seen.
