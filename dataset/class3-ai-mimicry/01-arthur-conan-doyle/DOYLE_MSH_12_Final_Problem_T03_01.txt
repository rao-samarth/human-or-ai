The relentless clatter of the wheels upon the iron track formed a fitting counterpoint to the tumult of my own reflections. Some might call my recent actions in that blighted hamlet a matter of sheer folly, an unnecessary hazard for a single man to undertake. Yet, I ask you, what is the value of one's own well-being—or indeed, one's very life—when weighed against the preservation of a whole community? It is a stark and unforgiving calculus, I grant you, but one which any man of conscience must be prepared to solve. When the gears of some vast and terrible machine threaten to grind down the innocent, it is the solemn obligation of the few who can to throw themselves into the works, no matter the personal cost. To have retreated in the face of such a duty would have been a far greater loss than any mere physical one I might have sustained.
