One had only to cast an eye about the glittering ballroom to observe a veritable who’s who of civic virtue. There stood Sir Eustace Morley, whose judgements from the bench were held as the epitome of British justice; yet I knew full well his most binding verdicts were delivered not in a courtroom, but in a curtained chamber over brandy and cigars. And that portly fellow, the director of a dozen charitable trusts? A most pious man, indeed, unless one happened to cross the interests of his peculiar fraternity, in which case one’s ruination was a matter of cold, calculated certainty. What a sublime performance of respectability it was! These were not men bound by common law, but by some damnable pact whose arcane symbols I had once seen—a crude sigil marking a man for a sudden disappearance or a most unfortunate accident. It was, I reflected, a deucedly efficient system for maintaining order, provided one never questioned who wrote the rules.
