I observe him now, pacing before the dying embers of his hearth—a most admirable specimen of a man who has at last procured all he ever desired. One recalls the fellow from his younger days, a creature of some vigour and crude pronouncements; now he is but a husk clad in the finest silk, his fortune secured and his spirit utterly spent. He pursued his station with the indefatigable resolve of a bloodhound, and having finally cornered his quarry, finds it to be made of little more than dust and bitter ashes. His friendships he discarded upon his ascent as a man might shed a soiled coat, and his principles he bartered for a pittance more of influence. And for what, I ask? To stalk this vast, silent house, haunted not by phantoms, but by the insufferable, hollow echo of his own triumph.
