The murmur of polite conversation was violently ruptured, not by a single sound, but by the frantic entrance of a uniformed messenger, his face ashen with exertion. He thrust a sealed dispatch into the hands of Chief Inspector Davies, who, until that moment, had been a model of stoic indifference amidst the glittering assembly. I watched the Inspector's expression shift with a rapidity that was in itself alarming; his jaw tightened, and he ripped the paper open with a savage gesture. He shot to his feet, sending his wine glass smashing to the parquet floor, the sudden violence silencing the entire gallery. "They have him!" he roared, his voice cracking with a fierce, triumphant passion I had never before witnessed. "The true culprit is in custody! Good heavens, gentlemen, poor Alistair Finch is a free man!" A wave of astonishment swept the room, yet I felt only a grim and profound relief, for what is the hunting of a hundred guilty men compared to the singular, desperate race to clear one who has been unjustly condemned?
