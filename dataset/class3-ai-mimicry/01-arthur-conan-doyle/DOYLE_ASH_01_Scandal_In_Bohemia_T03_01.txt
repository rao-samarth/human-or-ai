I stood for a moment by the overgrown hedgerow, my resolve hardening with every glance at the labourer’s squalid cottage. The man himself had the very aspect of a ruffian; a grim, sun-darkened countenance, hands like knotted roots, and a manner both sullen and furtive. The circumstantial facts of the case pointed squarely to him, and his appearance seemed to offer all the confirmation a reasonable man could require. Indeed, I had already formulated the precise words of my accusation. Yet, as I drew near, I observed him through the low cottage window, entirely unaware of my presence. He was crouched upon the floor, and with a delicacy of touch that was utterly incongruous with his brutish frame, he was carefully binding the shattered leg of a small field mouse. My certainty, so absolute only a moment before, evaporated in an instant, leaving me to question whether I was about to confront a common thief or grievously wrong a man whose soul was of a far finer quality than its crude vessel suggested.
