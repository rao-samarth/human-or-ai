One gazes upon this teeming river of humanity, this relentless metropolitan crush, and despairs at the lamentable indolence of the average intellect. Each man is a walking puzzle, a veritable encyclopaedia of his own follies and professions, yet his neighbour perceives nothing beyond the cut of a coat. It is a spectacle of singular blindness. Observe that fellow yonder, the one with the faint chemical discolouration upon his right cuff and the peculiar wear upon the toe of his left boot; it is as plain as the very nose on one’s face that he is a junior chemist, one who must perpetually brace his foot against the leg of a high stool whilst attending to his beakers. His very posture betrays a life of monotonous labour. To the masses, however, he is merely another anonymous face in the torrent, for what requires a modicum of systematic thought is to them a feat of impossible magic.
