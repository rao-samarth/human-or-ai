Pray, cast your eye upon that gentleman holding forth by the fountain; a veritable pillar of public virtue, is he not? Mark the earnest expression, the hand clasped over the heart as he pledges yet another small fortune to the city’s fund for destitute artists. The crowd, you will observe, adores him, for they see only the grand and noble performance. A most admirable show, I grant you, yet I find myself wondering what unfortunate enterprise such a dazzling curtain of benevolence is designed to conceal. Men do not construct such elaborate façades without a pressing need to hide the building’s true, and often rotten, foundations. His generosity is a splendidly constructed alibi, a public spectacle so loud it quite drowns out the rather more quiet, and I should venture, more permanent, business he concludes with those who unwisely stand in his path.
