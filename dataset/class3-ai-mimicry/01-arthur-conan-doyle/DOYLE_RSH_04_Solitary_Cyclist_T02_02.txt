I observed my late cousin’s widow, Mrs. Albright, positioned near the far window, a quiet island in the boisterous sea of our family’s seasonal gathering. Her hands remained clasped in her lap, a picture of placid stillness, yet a discerning eye could note the slight, incessant tremor in her fingers. The others, in their boisterous good humour, paid her no more mind than they would a piece of solemn furniture, attributing her silence to a gentle and retiring nature. I, however, have made a study of such temperaments and perceived in her a different quality altogether; it was not modesty that kept her lips sealed, but a profound and unnerving apprehension. She watches us all with the furtive alertness of a cornered doe, feigning composure whilst every nerve is coiled to spring. One feels she is a creature sustained by sheer willpower, a single incautious word away from utter collapse.
