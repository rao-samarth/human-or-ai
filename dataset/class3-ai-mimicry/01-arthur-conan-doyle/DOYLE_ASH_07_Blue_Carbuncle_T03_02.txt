I had for some time observed the singular case of young Matthews, a junior clerk whose future in our establishment hung by the very slenderest of threads. A grievous error had been discovered in the company ledgers, a miscalculation of such a nature that it threatened significant financial embarrassment, and the fault was laid squarely upon his shoulders. Dismissal seemed not merely likely, but an absolute certainty. Yet our senior partner, a man whose methods were often as unorthodox as they were effective, saw fit to grant the lad an interview rather than a summary discharge. The boy emerged from that office a changed man—not in any sudden, dramatic fashion, but in the quiet, methodical application he thenceforth brought to his duties. His former carelessness was supplanted by a rigorous attention to every trifling detail, and he worked with a silent, focused energy born not of fear, but of a deeply-felt obligation. It was a most practical demonstration of how a career thought to be ruined, when unexpectedly salvaged, may forge a far more reliable instrument than any initial, untested promise of success.
