Amidst the clamour of the city’s great thoroughfares, where a thousand faces might pass unremarked in a single hour, his was a countenance of such established goodwill that it had become a public landmark in itself. One saw him everywhere—at charity galas, upon the steps of the Exchange, his hand ever ready with a coin or a commendation. His deportment was a study in open-hearted candour, and his laughter seemed to echo the very optimism of the age; a more unlikely vessel for such profound treachery one could scarcely imagine. And yet, with the matter now brought to its final, startling elucidation, a singular sense of relief pervades the very air. The shock of the discovery is already receding, replaced by a bracing clarity, much like the sun burning away a stubborn morning fog. The wound, though deep, has been cleansed, and in its place, a sturdier, more discerning trust may now begin to flourish amongst us, a foundation made all the stronger for having withstood such a cunning test.
