Mr. Finchley was, to all outward appearances, a man of singular, almost unnerving, diligence. Long after the other clerks had departed for their hearths and families, his hunched figure could be seen beneath the solitary gas-lamp, his pen scratching assiduously across the vast pages of the company ledger. One might have supposed him to be possessed of some ferocious ambition, a man who saw in these columns of figures a direct path to wealth and station. Yet the truth was of a far more melancholy nature. He laboured not for what he might gain, but on account of all he had already lost. Each precise entry, each perfectly balanced sum, was a small stone laid upon a grave in his own mind; it was a desperate and methodical attempt to build a wall so high and so solid that the ghost of a happier time could no longer reach him. His indefatigable industry was, in its essence, a quiet, frantic flight from the silence of an empty home.
