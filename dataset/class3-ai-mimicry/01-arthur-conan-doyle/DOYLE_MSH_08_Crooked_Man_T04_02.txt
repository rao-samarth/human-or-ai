As we passed the ancient lych-gate, my companion, a man of considerable local knowledge, gestured with his chin towards a solitary figure tending the weeds upon a nameless grave. "A sad case, Mr Abernathy?" I enquired, for the man’s stooped and hollowed-out frame spoke of a burden far heavier than mere age. "The saddest in this parish," he returned in a low voice. "That is Elias Thorne. Forty years ago, he was a respected craftsman, but was wrongly accused in the matter of the magistrate's stolen silver. Though acquitted for want of proof, the shadow of the charge clung to him like a shroud; his business failed, his wife departed, and his name was forever sullied. The true villain confessed his part only upon his deathbed two decades past, yet what use was a posthumous apology? The initial wound, you see, had festered for so long that it poisoned the very wellspring of his existence, leaving only the husk you see before you."
