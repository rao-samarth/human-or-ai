The embers in the hearth glowed with a dying pulse, and in the profound stillness of the late hour I found myself pondering the curious architecture of the falsehood I had so carefully constructed. To have presented the poor girl with the unvarnished facts of her father's final, ruinous disgrace would have been an act of singular cruelty; a blow from which her gentle nature might never have recovered. Some truths, I have come to perceive, serve no higher purpose than to shatter what little peace a soul has managed to secure against the brutalities of the world. I had therefore offered her a more merciful fiction—a plausible tale of a sudden illness and a quiet passing in his sleep. It was a fragile edifice, to be sure, which the slightest breeze of inquiry might topple, yet for now it stood, a necessary shelter against a tempest of sordid reality. A necessary lie, perhaps, but a lie nonetheless, and the weight of it settled upon my conscience as the last of the coals turned to ash.
