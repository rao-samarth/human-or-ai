You ask me of the general sentiment at this gathering, and I must direct your attention to Sir Reginald, who stands near the grand staircase. Observe him closely, for despite the veneer of polite conversation, his face bears the unmistakable pallor of a man for whom retribution has at last arrived. For twenty years he has built his fortune and his name upon a foundation of what he surely considered a forgotten sin—a single act of profound betrayal committed in a distant port of call. Yet it is a fundamental law, as certain as gravity, that such deeds do not simply vanish into the ether; rather, they lie in wait, like a dormant seed, ready to sprout at the most inopportune moment. He may adjust his cuffs and force a smile, but his eyes dart towards the door, betraying the grim certainty that the account of his past has been presented, and payment is now, inescapably, due.
