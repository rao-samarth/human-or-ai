I have often observed, whilst sitting here in the quiet of my country study, how the most intricate of human problems resolve themselves entirely outside the purview of our constabulary. Take the recent matter of the old landowner, a brute of a man whose petty tyrannies were a plague upon this valley for a generation. The law, with its ponderous and inflexible machinery, could never have touched him; indeed, it was his staunchest shield. And yet, his end came not from a judge’s sentence, but from the desperate hand of a man he had systematically ruined. I feel no compunction in having kept my counsel on the matter. For there are some accounts, I believe, which cannot be settled in a courtroom, and some scales which can only be balanced by a force far more elemental and immediate than any statute written in a book.
