Amidst the clamour of the omnibus as it rattled down Bishopsgate, my attention was arrested by the couple seated opposite. The man, a portly fellow with a florid face, spoke not a word, yet he governed his companion with an iron discipline that a prison warden might envy. Her eyes, bright with interest at some passing spectacle, would dart to his face for a permission that was never granted; a quiet, almost imperceptible shake of his head or the slight tightening of his grip upon the umbrella he held was sufficient. She would then shrink back, the momentary animation draining from her features as if a tap had been turned. Here was a tyranny that left no mark upon the flesh, a dominion of the soul enforced by a glance, a gesture. It was a ghastly, silent affair played out for all the world to see, yet visible only to one who knew that the cruelest chains are those which are forged from fear and are, to the common eye, entirely invisible.
