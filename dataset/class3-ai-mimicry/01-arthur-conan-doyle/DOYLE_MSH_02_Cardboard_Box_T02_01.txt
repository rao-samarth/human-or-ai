As the carriage rattled us through the darkening fens, my mind returned irresistibly to the lamentable affair we had just left behind in that small market town. It is a most singular and tragic pattern which I have observed repeat itself time and again, and one which seems to spring from the very deepest well of human passion. A promise is broken, a sacred trust betrayed in some clandestine meeting, and from that single act of duplicity, a poison begins to seep into the foundations of a home. I have seen how such a secret, once introduced, will fester and grow, twisting affection into suspicion and love into a most potent form of hatred. It is then but a small step from the whispered lie to the desperate act, for when a man believes his honour and his household have been irredeemably violated, his reason is often the first casualty, and the coroner is invariably the last to be called.
