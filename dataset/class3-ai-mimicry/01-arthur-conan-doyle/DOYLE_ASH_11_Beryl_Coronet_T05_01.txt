My dear Alistair, you would find this dreary family affair as insufferable as I do, were it not for the small dramas which play out upon the human canvas for any who care to see. Take our cousin Edward, for instance. His wife proclaims his new shipping venture a roaring success, yet the man himself presents a study in contradiction. Observe the cuff of his right sleeve, frayed in a manner that speaks not of age but of anxious picking; note the faint, almost imperceptible splash of ink upon his thumb, a mark inconsistent with a gentleman of leisure. And what of that nervous habit of his, the incessant tapping of his signet ring upon the mahogany? A man whose fortunes are on the rise does not betray such profound disquiet. The facts, my friend, are quite plain: the venture is a catastrophe, and poor Edward is likely but a week away from ruin, a conclusion I have drawn not from gossip, but from the simple, undeniable evidence before my very eyes.
