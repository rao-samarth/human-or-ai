I observed him then, as he stood silhouetted against the pale moonlight filtering through the library window, a man utterly undone. The source of his ruin lay scattered upon the desk: a sheaf of handsome but entirely worthless bonds. It was a simple enough deception, one which a more temperate man would have dismissed out of hand. Yet the promise of a tenfold return on his investment, a proposition of such astonishing scope, had proven too great a temptation for his considerable, yet rapacious, intellect. The sheer audacity of the swindle, which ought to have been its most glaring signal of danger, had instead acted as a siren's call to his covetous nature. The rogue who had engineered this disaster had not preyed upon a lack of intelligence, you see, but rather upon an excess of desire—for he knew well that a mind consumed by the feverish calculation of unearned riches has no room left for sober and necessary doubt.
