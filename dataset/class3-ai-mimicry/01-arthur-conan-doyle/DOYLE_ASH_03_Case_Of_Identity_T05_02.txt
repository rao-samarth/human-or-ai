I had observed the man for the better part of a week upon the steamer, a boisterous fellow who styled himself "The Colonel" and whose perambulations upon the deck were a masterclass in theatricality. He possessed a ferocious, dyed moustache, a pronounced limp which appeared to afflict a different leg with each morning’s tide, and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of tales from the Indian frontier, each more perilous than the last. The other passengers, for the most part, were entirely captivated by this martial personage, hanging upon his every word as he held court near the funnel. It was therefore with some private amusement that I watched him clap a quiet, grey-haired gentleman upon the shoulder, booming, “You have the look of a fighting man about you, sir! Cavalry, I’d wager?” The gentleman, who I happened to know had spent thirty years in the most dangerous outposts of the Empire, merely blinked. “I sold drapery in Cheapside, sir,” he replied with a mild smile, before turning back to his newspaper, leaving the magnificent Colonel quite deflated and, for the first time, utterly speechless.
