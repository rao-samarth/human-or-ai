Observe that stout gentleman by the window, my dear fellow, the one with the look of self-satisfied prosperity. One might suppose him a pillar of the City, without a single care to disturb his digestion. And yet, I happen to know that some two decades since, he engineered the utter ruin of his partner in a venture overseas, a good man driven to an early grave by penury and despair. The thing was cleverly done; no law was broken, no evidence remained. He believed the account to be closed, the slate wiped clean by the convenient passage of years. But such ledgers are never truly balanced, for the debt simply accrues its interest in the shadows. Do you see the thin, pale lad who just now took the seat opposite him, holding a sheaf of papers? That, my friend, is the son of the man he destroyed, and I fancy by the grim set of his jaw that a final reckoning is at last about to be made.
