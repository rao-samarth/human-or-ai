It was a lamentable thing to observe the quiet decay of the Gresham family, a rot which had set in not from some external misfortune, but from a canker festering deep within their own house. One saw it in the drawing-room, where conversations faltered and died like untended fires, and in the very posture of the two aging sisters, who moved about their ancestral home with the hunched shoulders of those carrying a great and invisible weight. The silence in that place was of a peculiar and heavy quality; it was not the peace of contentment but the oppressive stillness which follows a disaster, where some vital truth lies buried beneath the rubble. Each member was a gaoler to the others, and in turn a prisoner themselves, bound by unspoken oaths to protect a fragile, inherited lie that had long since become a mere instrument of their mutual, slow-burning torment. The truth, I suspect, would have been a sharp but cleansing wound, whereas this prolonged concealment had become a creeping sickness for which there was no cure.
