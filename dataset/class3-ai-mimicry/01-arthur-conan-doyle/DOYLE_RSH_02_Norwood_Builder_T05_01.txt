The clattering rhythm of the wheels upon the track seemed to mock the sluggishness of the official police mind, whose conclusions I had so recently overturned. They had been entirely satisfied, you see, with the theory of a common tramp, a botched robbery; it was simple, it required no great mental exertion, and it closed the case. Yet they had failed to ask why a seasoned thief would use a glass-cutter on a ground-floor window that was already unlatched, or why the victim’s notoriously fierce mastiff had offered no alarm whatsoever. It is this singular inability to connect one indisputable fact to another that forever hampers the constabulary. They see the facts, yes, but as separate, disconnected beads, whereas I perceive at once the thread upon which they must all be strung. A little logic, a little patient observation, and the entire pathetic fabrication of a random crime dissolved to reveal a carefully plotted domestic conspiracy, a truth as plain as the grimy countryside flashing past my window.
