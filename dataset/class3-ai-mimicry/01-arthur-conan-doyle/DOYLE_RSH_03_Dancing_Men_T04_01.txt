It was at my uncle’s annual Christmas soirée that I first perceived the true nature of Mr. Finch’s designs upon my dear cousin Eleanor. He hovered about her with a suffocating solicitude, his gaze not that of a man who adores a woman, but rather of a collector who regards a rare specimen, whose very life must be pinned and mounted for his exclusive gratification. I saw in his eyes that proprietary gleam, that dreadful assumption of ownership which so often masquerades as devotion but is, in truth, its most sinister counterfeit. She, poor girl, in her artless disposition mistook this constant surveillance for profound affection, and I could observe the very net closing about her with every polite laugh and gentle nod. What, I ask you, was a man of reason to do in such a circumstance? To stand idly by whilst such a vibrant spirit was to be caged and, in time, extinguished for another's vanity? It was an intolerable proposition; hence, I knew that some intervention—however lamentable its consequences might appear to the uninitiated—was not merely an option, but a singular necessity.
