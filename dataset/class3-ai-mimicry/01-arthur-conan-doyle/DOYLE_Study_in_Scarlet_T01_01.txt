Leave the wretched fellow to the constables and the assizes; it is their proper business, and they will see him brought to account.” I merely shook my head, for he could not begin to comprehend the great chasm which separated his view from my own. “Their business,” I answered, my voice low, “is a matter of statutes and ledgers—a cold, mechanical process which culminates in a hempen rope or a stone cell. It is an affair of the state, utterly devoid of the personal element which is the very heart of this appalling matter. What I intend is a settlement of a far more intimate and terrible nature. You speak of the law’s slow retribution, but I mean to deliver a man’s immediate reckoning, and in so doing I shall become a brute no better than he. It is a price, my friend, I am entirely prepared to pay.”
