Pray, observe that specimen of manufactured chivalry now bowing over the widow’s teacup, and tell me if you have ever witnessed a more nauseatingly perfect pantomime. One might almost be convinced of his sincerity, were it not for the cold, reptilian stillness of his gaze which his saccharine smile quite fails to reach. Every compliment he utters is a carefully measured dose of poison, designed not to kill but to anaesthetise the faculties of reason and, more to the point, to loosen the strings of her late husband’s purse. It is a most contemptible art, this feigning of affection for predatory gain. He plays the devoted admirer with such theatrical flair that the poor woman likely sees a saviour, when, to any man of sense, he is so obviously nothing more than a well-dressed vulture patiently awaiting the final, exhausted sigh of his chosen carrion.
