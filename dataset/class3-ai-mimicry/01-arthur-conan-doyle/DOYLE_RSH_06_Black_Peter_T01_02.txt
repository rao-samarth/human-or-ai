My dear friend, I write to you from Lord Ashworth’s rather tedious annual gala, where the topic of conversation has suddenly turned from politics to a matter of a far grislier nature. You will surely recall Marcus Thorne, the shipping magnate whose rise was a study in ruthless acquisition and whose reputation for cruelty was whispered in every club from Pall Mall to the City. He was a man of iron will and no discernible conscience, one who broke competitors with the same dispassionate finality with which a smith shatters cold metal. It seems, however, that the final account has been settled. News has just arrived that Thorne’s own security chief, a brute he had plucked from a Marseilles gutter and trusted implicitly, has turned upon him. Thorne was found in his study, not with a simple bullet, but bludgeoned by the very strongbox which contained the fruits of his unscrupulous career; a grimly appropriate end, I think, for one who lived by the iron law of force.
