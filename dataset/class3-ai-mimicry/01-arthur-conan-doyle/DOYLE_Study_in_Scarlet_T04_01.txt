It is a curious study, and a melancholy one, to observe the clerks at their desks, each a small island of quiet industry in the great, murmuring sea of the firm. One sees Mr. Abernathy, for instance, his spine as straight as the ruler he employs, and might readily deduce that here is a man whose inner life is as placid and well-ordered as his immaculate ledgers. His demeanour is a fortress of quiet competence, repelling any idle inquiry. And yet, I have noted the slightest tremor in his hand as he reaches for his noon-day tea, and have seen in his eyes, when he believes himself unobserved, a look of such profound and settled sorrow that it quite undoes the entire performance. A man may present a most placid and unruffled front to the world, yet behind that careful façade may lie a grief so vast that it has hollowed him out entirely, leaving but the shell of duty to carry on.
