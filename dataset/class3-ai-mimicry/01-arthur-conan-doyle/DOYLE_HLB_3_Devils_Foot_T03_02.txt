I was taking my tea in the public lounge of a rather unremarkable hotel when my attention was drawn to the two gentlemen seated near the window. One, a man whose sun-scorched countenance and nervous, darting eyes spoke of long service in the hotter climates of the Empire, was speaking in a low, urgent tone to his companion. “I tell you, James,” he hissed, leaning so far across the small table that his teacup rattled precariously, “it is not the fever or the local treachery one must fear, but the trifles one acquires and thinks nothing of. A carved fetish, a dried flower, a simple length of patterned cloth—these are the vessels. They carry a taint, a peculiar malevolence that festers in our civilised air.” His companion, a stout and altogether unimaginative-looking fellow, merely scoffed, but I could not mistake the tremor in the traveller’s hand as he gestured. He was not a man telling a mere ghost story for effect; he was a man who had, I am quite certain, unwittingly unpacked some insidious peril from his trunk and set it loose upon the unsuspecting soil of his homeland.
