In the quiet confines of our little parish, one observes a recurring drama, a contest as old as the very stones in the churchyard. A man of formidable physical presence—a quarryman, perhaps, whose labours have turned his arms to oak—will invariably seek to impose his will through sheer intimidation and the threat of direct, physical consequence. He sees the world as a nail to be driven. Yet, time and again, I have witnessed such a fellow brought to a complete standstill by some unassuming librarian or quiet solicitor; a man whose only weapon is a precise knowledge of an obscure statute, or the careful construction of a phrase which turns the aggressor’s own momentum against him. It is a most instructive spectacle, for it demonstrates that the intricate mechanism of a well-ordered mind can construct a barrier more impassable than any wall, and a trap more certain than any snare of rope and steel.
