The new ledger-keeping system, introduced with much fanfare by the junior partners, was a model of efficiency; its neatly ruled columns and crisp, modern font gave the entire department an air of unimpeachable order. Mr. Abernathy, a man whose forty years in the firm had rendered him immune to such novelties, observed it all with a quiet dispassion. To the casual eye, it was merely an improvement—a step towards greater clarity in their accounts. Yet, it was precisely this superficial perfection that struck a discordant note in his logical mind. He had noted that the ink, a peculiar shade of violet, never seemed to fade or smudge, a most singular quality. He saw, too, how certain clerks, those most fastidious in their duties, developed a persistent, dry cough after only a week of handling the new books. It was a trifling detail, to be sure, but one which suggested that the true cost of this vaunted progress was not tallied in shillings and pence, but in a far more sinister currency, hidden beneath the veneer of meticulous bookkeeping.
