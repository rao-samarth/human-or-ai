We had scarce settled at our table in the crowded chop-house when a sudden commotion by the door drew every eye. A young clerk, his face flushed with the chase, had apprehended a wretched-looking waif, no older than ten, who clutched a half-eaten meat pie. “To the constable with him!” bellowed a portly gentleman nearby, thumping his fist upon the table. “The law is the law, and such villainy must be answered for!” Yet the clerk hesitated, his gaze fixed upon the boy’s hollow cheeks and the raw desperation in his eyes; it was a gaze that seemed to weigh the statutes of the realm against some deeper, unwritten code of human decency. Then, with a quiet resolve that silenced the blustering gentleman more effectively than any retort, he simply pressed a few coins into the proprietor’s hand, turned to the boy, and said in a low voice, “Be off with you, and sin no more.” It was an act, I reflected, that a magistrate might condemn, but which a higher court—that of a man’s own conscience—would surely acquit with full honours.
