A respect that had bordered on reverence began to curdle, you see, into a most corrosive envy, until I could no longer bear the sound of his cheerful whistle from across the hedgerow. And so, with a carefully forged letter suggesting a fraudulent discovery on his part, I ruined him utterly. The silence in the neighbouring woods is now mine alone, a profound and desolate quiet that I find I can no longer endure.
