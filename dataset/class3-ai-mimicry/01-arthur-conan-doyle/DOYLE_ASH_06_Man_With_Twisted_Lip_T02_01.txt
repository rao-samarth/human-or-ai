My travelling companion upon the Dover express was a man of a most singular and, I might say, unpleasant type. Corpulent and florid, with a watch-chain of quite audacious vulgarity, he spoke in a booming monotone of his commercial ventures to his long-suffering secretary. I could not but overhear some fragment of their discourse, which concerned a certain shipment of goods of a decidedly questionable quality. The younger man raised some timid objection as to the damage this might inflict upon their firm’s good name, to which the magnate responded with a coarse laugh. "Reputation," he declared, with a wave of a jewelled hand, "is but a poor sort of currency, my boy; it fills no coffers and pays no dividends!" It struck me then as a most lamentable sign of our age, that a man's honour might be so readily bartered away, and that the solid respect of his fellow men should be held in such cheap esteem when weighed against the glittering, yet ultimately hollow, promise of a few extra pounds sterling.
