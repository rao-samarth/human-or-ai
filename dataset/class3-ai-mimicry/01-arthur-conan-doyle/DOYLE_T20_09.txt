The gentleman opposite, a portly fellow with a booming voice, had spent the better part of our journey from Paddington expounding upon the virtues of the common labourer, declaring that a nation’s soul might be measured by its deference to the humble. He was, to hear him tell it, a veritable apostle of the downtrodden. Yet when a simple porter, in delivering our refreshments, happened to jostle the man’s elbow—causing a mere trifle of tea to slop into the saucer—his philanthropic countenance underwent a most singular transformation. The florid complexion deepened to a furious purple, and he delivered a dressing-down of such withering condescension that the poor lad fairly trembled. For a full minute the air was thick with accusations of oafishness and ineptitude, a shocking tirade over a few spilled drops. Once the unfortunate porter had retreated, my companion resumed his lecture on universal brotherhood, apparently oblivious to any contradiction. I could not but observe that his grand sympathy for the masses appeared to evaporate entirely when confronted with a single, tangible man.
