One could not help but observe my uncle, Reginald, preening by the mantelpiece—a man whose name, not six months prior, was fit only for the creditor’s ledger and the most scurrilous of gossip columns. Now, having secured some paltry colonial appointment through means best left unexamined, he held forth upon the subject of integrity as if he himself had invented the concept. It was a most singular performance. My assembled relations, who had previously spoken of him in hushed and horrified tones, now hung upon his every word, their memories apparently as short as their purses had once been long. It is a curious facet of human nature, this desperate eagerness to re-gild a tarnished idol; one need only apply a thin veneer of success, and all the rot beneath is conveniently forgotten. He was a phoenix, they whispered—though it struck me he had risen not from ashes, but from the smouldering ruins of other men’s fortunes.
