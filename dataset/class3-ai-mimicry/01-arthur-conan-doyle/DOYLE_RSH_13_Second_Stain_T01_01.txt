You ask me, my dear fellow, why this great metropolis holds its breath, and I shall tell you. It is not the rumble of the omnibuses upon the cobblestones, nor the usual clamour of the markets, but a tension of a far more perilous kind. The matter, I can confide, is one of the gravest import, for a document of immense significance has found its way into the wrong hands—a document which, should its contents be revealed, would set the continent ablaze. I have seen the faces of the men in Downing Street, and they are ashen; the couriers from the foreign embassies scurry with a haste that speaks of nothing but impending crisis. A single foolish disclosure, a single article in the morning papers, and the entire fragile peace which we have so painstakingly constructed might shatter into a thousand pieces, leaving us to face a calamity from which there can be no easy return.
