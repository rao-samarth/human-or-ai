You perceive, my dear fellow, only the discrepancy in the ledger before you, a single, stark inconsistency which your meticulous nature has rightly seized upon; yet you fail to apprehend the far greater and more ruinous truth which that small fiction was designed to obscure. It was, I assure you, a most necessary falsehood. Had the unvarnished facts of our quarterly losses been laid bare, a panic would have ensued amongst the shareholders—the investors would have fled like rats from a sinking vessel—and this entire enterprise, with its five hundred souls depending upon it for their daily bread, would have foundered before the month was out. I chose, therefore, not the path of absolute honesty, which would have led to an immediate and widespread calamity, but the path of judicious omission. It was a calculated risk, a surgeon’s precise cut to save the patient, and I should not hesitate to make precisely the same choice again.
