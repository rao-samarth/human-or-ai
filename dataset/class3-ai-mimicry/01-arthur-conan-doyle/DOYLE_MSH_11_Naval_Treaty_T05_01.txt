I observed the junior clerk, Mr. Atherton, as the damning telegram was laid upon his desk. For a long, silent moment, he stared at the slip of paper, and I saw in the clenching of his jaw and the sudden pallor of his skin the clear signs of a spirit on the verge of utter ruin. His posture sagged, and his breathing grew shallow; the tempest of despair was gathering to break him. Yet, even as the first tremor of a sob shook his frame, he straightened his back. A new light, hard and analytical, entered his eyes. He took up his pen, not with a flourish of renewed hope, but with the grim, mechanical precision of a man who has set aside all sentiment. He began to calculate, to make notes upon a fresh sheet, his mind seizing upon the practical facts of his disaster. It was a singular display of the will, demonstrating how the disciplined intellect can, when all seems lost, erect a formidable bulwark against the surging tide of pure, unreasoning emotion.
