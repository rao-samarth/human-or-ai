The sudden eclipse of Mr. Alistair Finch, our town’s esteemed librarian, was a matter of considerable and ill-natured gossip. Hitherto a man whose character was as neatly ordered as his catalogues, he was now perceived as a rogue, a scoundrel of the first water, all on account of a missing sum from the parish fund with which he had been entrusted. Yet, I could not reconcile the man I knew with the base accusations laid against him, having observed him only the day before the discovery, speaking in low, urgent tones with young widow Croft, whose pale face was a mask of sheer desperation. Finch said nothing in his own defence, offering no explanation, and thus allowed the full weight of public condemnation to fall upon him. He had evidently made a grim calculation: that his own standing in our small community, a thing carefully constructed over twenty years, was a fair price to pay for the safeguarding of another’s precarious existence, an act of quiet martyrdom which the prattling gossips could never be expected to understand.
