As the green fields of the countryside blur past my carriage window, my mind, alas, turns not to the future but to the ruin of the past. I reflect upon poor Alistair, a man I once held as dear as any brother, and wonder at what precise moment the canker took root in his soul. It was not, I perceive now, a sudden malady, but rather a slow, creeping affliction nurtured by every small success I was fortunate enough to achieve. Each paper published, each word of praise from the Society—these were not shared victories to him, but fresh wounds to his own pride. What a corrosive force it is, that green-eyed sentiment, which can twist a man of such evident intellect into a common saboteur; to see him at last, with my own eyes, substituting my final calculations for his own flawed work was a blow from which my trust in my fellow man may never, I fear, entirely recover.
