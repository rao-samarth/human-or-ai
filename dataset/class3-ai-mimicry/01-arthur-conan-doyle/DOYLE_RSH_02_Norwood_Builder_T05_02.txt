Pray, have a look at this account, my dear fellow. The constabulary, it seems, are quite convinced our thief was some manner of acrobat, flinging himself from a carriage moving at this very velocity into the marshland below. A dramatic theory, and one which the papers have seized upon with predictable relish! Yet they neglect the most elementary of facts, for a man does not leap from a sealed compartment—observe the condensation upon these panes, for no window has been opened against this autumn chill. It is a suicidal absurdity. Look instead at that small smudge of reddish clay upon the inner latch of our own door, a trifling detail identical to the soil of the last station. It suggests, does it not, that our man did not make a dramatic exit at all; rather, he made a most discreet entrance when the officials, content in their own assumptions, believed all was secure.
