It was in a crowded railway carriage, amidst the hiss of steam and the clatter of wheels, that I chanced to overhear a fragment of conversation which struck me as a most curious study in human nature. A gentleman of military bearing, his face etched with the cares of some far-flung campaign, was speaking in a low, intense voice to his companion. "You would not know him now, Armitage," he declared, "for the man we once knew is quite gone. Before this immense fortune fell upon him, there was no more charitable soul in the city; his hand was ever open, his sympathies broad and his laughter ready. Yet now, he has become a creature of suspicion. He squabbles over pennies, sees a swindler in every supplicant, and has built around himself a fortress of distrust. It is a singular and terrible alchemy, for the very gold that promised him freedom has instead forged the heaviest of chains, binding him not to poverty, but to the perpetual, miserable fear of it."
