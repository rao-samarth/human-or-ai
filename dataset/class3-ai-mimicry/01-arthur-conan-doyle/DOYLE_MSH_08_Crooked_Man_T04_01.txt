In the far corner of the somber coffee-house, an elderly gentleman nursed his cup, though he seemed to draw from it more shadow than warmth. It was not the common destitution of the city that clung to him, but something more profound—a settled weariness that spoke of a battle lost long ago. One could readily surmise that here was a man whose entire existence had been derailed by a single, grievous act of malfeasance in his youth. A false accusation, perchance, or the ruinous betrayal of a trusted colleague; whatever the original calamity, its consequences had evidently radiated through the subsequent decades of his life. Such a profound injury, inflicted upon the soul in its formative years, does not mend. Instead, it becomes a slow, internal poison, ensuring that every potential joy is tainted and every hope is stillborn, leaving behind only the husk of a man to bear silent witness to a crime for which there was never any true restitution.
