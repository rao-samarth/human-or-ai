The Inspector, a man whose certainty far outstripped his perception, fell silent at last, his final, damning statement hanging in the still air of the lamp-lit study. All eyes turned to Mr. Abernathy, who, far from exhibiting the agitation of a cornered man, merely steepled his fingers and gazed into the middle distance as though contemplating a chess problem of moderate difficulty. We had expected protestations, a desperate cry of innocence, or perhaps the blustering indignation of a gentleman whose honour had been impugned. Instead, he offered a quiet sigh. “Your chain of reasoning is quite admirable, Inspector; each link connects to the next with apparent strength,” he observed, his tone more suited to a university lecture than a drawing-room inquest. “It has, however, one lamentable flaw, which is that its very first link—the assumption of my presence at the club—is forged from fancy rather than fact. A simple inquiry with the night porter would have saved you a considerable expenditure of both time and logic.”
