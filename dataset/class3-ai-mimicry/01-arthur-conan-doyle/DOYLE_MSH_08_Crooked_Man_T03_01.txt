Amidst the glittering chandeliers and the polite murmur of the soirée, my eye was drawn to Sir Jasper. He stood apart, a spectre at the feast, his countenance a mask of forced civility. I have long held the conviction that a man’s secret sins, if harboured for a sufficient duration, will inevitably write themselves upon his very features for any keen observer to read. It is a slow and insidious poison, this unconfessed transgression; one which works not upon the body with the brute force of a physical ailment, but upon the spirit, hollowing a man from the inside until naught remains but a fragile shell. One could perceive in his haunted gaze the ghost of some past deed, a shadow that had clung to him for years, and I had little doubt that this phantom would, in the end, prove more fatal than any blade or bullet. Such a malady of the soul admits of no earthly cure, and its final symptom is always the grave.
