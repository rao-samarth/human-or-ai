It is a most singular and sobering reflection, as I sit here amongst my quiet English roses, how a man may travel the globe and face down the most savage of beasts and men, only to meet his end through some trifle brought home in his luggage. I think of poor Alistair, returned from his botanical expedition in the Amazon basin, his health seemingly unimpaired by the fevers and hardships of that benighted region. He was prouder of a certain orchid than of all his other discoveries, and he tended it with a devotion that bordered upon the fanatical. Who could have suspected that its vibrant, exotic bloom concealed a miasma so potent, a pollen so utterly alien to our constitutions, that it would slowly and inexorably seal his lungs? We seek out the marvels of the world, indeed, but we forget that nature has its own sentinels, and that a thing of beauty in one clime may become a purveyor of silent, creeping death in another.
