You may call me a scoundrel, and perhaps by some sentimental measure I am deserving of the title. I do not deny that my affections were engaged, for to do so would be a falsehood as black as any I have been accused of. But a man’s heart is a small and private kingdom, whereas his word, once given, is a bond that holds society itself together. To have followed my own inclination—a course which I confess would have brought me a happiness I can now scarcely imagine—would have meant the ruin of a good family and the public disgrace of a man to whom I owe my very station in life. What choice, then, was truly left to me? To secure my own bliss at the cost of another’s utter destruction? No, the debt had to be paid, and I was the one who must, in the end, provide the coin.
