I listened to his impassioned plea, his knuckles white upon the arm of his chair, and found myself contemplating the curious machinery of our legal system. For what is the law, in its essence, but a great and cumbersome engine, designed for the general good, yet so often grinding the individual to dust? It is a net with meshes so wide that the great predators of our society swim through it with impunity, whilst the minnows are invariably caught. I have seen it a hundred times: the scoundrel protected by a technicality, the innocent ruined by a lack of proof that the heart knows to be true. And in such cases, when the official channels are choked with red tape and the cry of the wronged goes unheard, is it not the duty of any man with certain capabilities to step in? To become, for a moment, that final court of appeal where a truer, more elemental justice may at last be served?
