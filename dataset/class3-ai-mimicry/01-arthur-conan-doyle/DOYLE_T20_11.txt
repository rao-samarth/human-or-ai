We had taken a bench near the public gardens to enjoy a rare moment of April sunshine, when our attention was drawn to the rather vehement discourse of two ladies seated nearby. The principal speaker, a formidable matron crowned with a hat of quite alarming proportions, was holding forth upon the moral decay of the labouring classes. “It is a national disgrace, I declare!” her voice carried across the lawn with an unfortunate clarity. “The sheer indolence, the absolute want of industry. They possess no sense of duty to better their station, content to accept their squalid lot.” Her companion nodded in solemn agreement. Having concluded this damning verdict, the woman unwrapped a small confection, consumed it with a delicate precision, and then, with a flick of her gloved wrist, allowed the silver paper to flutter down upon the immaculate grass. My friend caught my eye, the faintest of smiles touching his thin lips. “It would appear,” he murmured, “that the duty of tidiness is a burden intended solely for those of an inferior station.”
