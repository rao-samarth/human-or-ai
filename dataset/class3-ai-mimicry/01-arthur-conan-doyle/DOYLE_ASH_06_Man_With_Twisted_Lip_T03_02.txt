Mr. Abernathy surveyed the grand reception from his position by the marble pillar, a post he had cultivated for its excellent view and its proximity to a swift, discreet exit. It was a singular torment, this constant vigilance; to be lauded in one circle whilst being a creature of the shadows in another demanded a mental fortitude he felt was fast deserting him. Then, he saw him.

A cold perspiration broke upon Abernathy’s brow. The man had only to cast his eyes this way, to offer the slightest, coarsest nod of recognition, and the whole intricate artifice of his existence would crumble to dust. He forced his lips into a semblance of a smile, turning to the lady beside him, yet the polite words he uttered were but a hollow echo against the frantic pounding of his own treacherous heart.
