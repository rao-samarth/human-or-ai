Master Fenwick stood upon a crate, his voice a brazen trumpet in the market square, when old Lord Alaric, his face a thundercloud, did push through the gawking crowd. "Hold thy foul tongue, sirrah!" Alaric's voice, though aged, cut through the din like a blade. "You have with viperous slander sought to stain my family's crest, a name held spotless for a hundred years." Fenwick, unabashed, sneered down from his perch. "I speak what all men whisper, my lord; your virtue is a mask for avarice." The old lord's hand trembled, not with fear, but with a righteous fury. "Whispers are the work of cowards. Take my coin, take my very house, and I should count the loss a trifle; but you would rob me of that which makes me man, the untarnished legacy I must bequeath my sons. Speak your retraction now, before this company, or you shall find that even an old lion, stripped of all but his good report, hath claws yet sharp enough for such a cur as you."
