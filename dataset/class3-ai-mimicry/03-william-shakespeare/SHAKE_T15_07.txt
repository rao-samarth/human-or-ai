Mark you that gentleman beside the fountain? See how his discourse is all with the carven maid, whose marble ears can hear naught of his plea. Some say it began as a simple admiration, a poet’s fancy for a well-wrought form; but now the fancy hath become the master, and the man its sorry slave. He brings it trinkets, as a suitor might; he chides it for its coldness, then begs its pardon with a frantic air. His own substance wastes away, his reason is but a ghost, whilst this one image, fixed and immutable, consumes the very marrow of his soul. His world is shrunk to this small compass, and we who watch are but shadows passing on the wall of his strange prison.
