Pray, lean closer, for I would not have this common knowledge shouted to the wind, though it be a truth as plain as these cobblestones beneath our feet. I have observed how men, in the high noon of their prosperity, do bind themselves with words as strong as iron chains, each professing a love that no peril could e'er undo. They build their fellowship like a great manor, solid and fair to all outward view. But let the season turn; let some rumour of ruin whisper at the gate, or a rival prince offer a sliver of his power for a quiet word of disloyalty. Then you shall see what rot lies in the timbers. The staunchest friend may prove a hollow echo, his vows dissolving like the morning mist, and one learns too late that the truest measure of a man's soul is taken only when he stands to lose all for keeping his word.
