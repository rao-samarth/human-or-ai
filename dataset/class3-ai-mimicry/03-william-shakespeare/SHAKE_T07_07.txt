The sun beat harshly upon the stones of the great market square, where a crier, in the Duke's own gaudy livery, did proclaim a most grievous edict. A new levy, he called it, to line the coffers of a war none here had wished for; a tithe not of our plenty, but of our very want. At first, a hush did fall, a stillness as of the grave. But then, a low sound began to rise, a humming like to angry bees trapped within a hive, a sound that was not a shout, nay, nor any treasonous cry, but a thing more fell and dangerous: a thousand heads that would not bow, a thousand backs that did refuse to bend. And I, who stood amongst them, felt my own heart become a battleground. To turn my heel and seek the safety of my shop was wisdom, for what good can one man do against a Prince's iron will? Yet to remain, to lend my silence to their stubborn, swelling quiet, felt the truer and more perilous course. Wherefore doth a man's conscience war so fiercely with his reason, when both do seek to save him?
