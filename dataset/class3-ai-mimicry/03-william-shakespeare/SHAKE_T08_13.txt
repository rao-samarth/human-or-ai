Hark, what a clamor rises from the market square, where some poor wretch hath been taken for his crime. The throng presseth close, their voices a singular beast that cryeth for a swift and bloody end. They name it a just reckoning, a balancing of the scales that this foul villain hath so tipped with his misdeeds. Yet I perceive in their hot-breathed shouts not the cool hand of measure, but the feverish grip of spite, a hunger to see suffering repaid with yet more suffering. For who amongst this rabble holds the true scales? Is it the magistrate, in his fine robes, or the mob itself, whose passion is its only law? To give a wrong its due is one thing; to delight in the giving is quite another, and methinks the coin of one oft passeth for the other in the dim light of mortal anger.
