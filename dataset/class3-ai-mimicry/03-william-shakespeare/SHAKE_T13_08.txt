So certain was I in my own account, my sums laid down with such a practiced hand, that the master himself hath oft declared my ledger a perfect mirror of his wealth. For ten full years, no blemish ever stained its pages. Yet now this boy, this green apprentice whose quill yet trembles, points with a timid finger to one small column and asks a question that doth turn my blood to ice. A heat rises to my cheek, a foul and sudden blush, for I see the truth in his unlettered scrawl: a trifle missed, a single digit turned to naught that now makes a liar of the whole. The other scribes have stayed their pens; their eyes, like so many curious birds, do peck at my disgrace. What must I do? To praise the whelp for his sharp sight is to confess my own dimming vision and invite their scorn, yet to dissemble—to swear the book is true and the boy a fool—doth promise but a greater, more damnable reckoning when the full audit comes.
