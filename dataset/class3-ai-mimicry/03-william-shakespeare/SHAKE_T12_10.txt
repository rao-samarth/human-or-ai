The moon, that sliver'd spy, doth cast a wicked gleam upon the heap of gold within his lordship's coffer, left so carelessly agape. Wherefore should one man's fortune swell so, whilst mine own shrinks to naught but dust and bitter debt? One piece, but one, purloin'd from such a dragon's hoard, would ne'er be reckon'd absent by him who spills more wine than my poor babes drink water. My soul cries villain at the thought; it warns of judgement and the everlasting fire. Yet what judgement is more sharp than a child's hungry eyes, and what fire burns hotter than the shame of an empty purse? The glistering coin seems almost to call my name, a siren's song promising an end to misery. See how my hand doth shake, caught 'twixt this golden devil and the pale ghost of honour, and I know not which shall claim the victory ere morning comes.
