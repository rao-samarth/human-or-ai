What poison works so swift as a word misheard? I see my cousin turn his back upon his own blood, and his good lady wife doth wear a face of stone, all for a jest I spake but an hour past concerning some trivial inheritance. I meant it for a trifle, a mere puff of air to stir the merry mood, yet he received it as a poisoned dart aimed at his very heart. Now look how the rancour spreads like a foul contagion through this hall; a cold shoulder here, a sharp and clipped reply there, until the entire feast is soured with this silent mutiny of spirit. A chasm hath been opened by a single breath, and I fear no bridge of reason may be built to span it ere this night is done, leaving kinship fractured for a cause too slight for memory.
