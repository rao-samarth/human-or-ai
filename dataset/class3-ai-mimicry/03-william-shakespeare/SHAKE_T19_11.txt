Pray, look upon this scene of seeming peace. Here, kinsmen meet with many a hearty laugh and cup of wine raised high in feigned accord. The air is thick with pleasant words, as if no bitter root could grow in such well-tended soil. Yet, mark the swift and jealous glance from brother unto brother when the patriarch speaks of legacy; hear the whisper, soft as a moth's wing, that carries poison from one ear to the next. They carve the joint and share the bread, and all is amity. But beneath this painted cheerfulness, old grievances do fester like a hidden wound, and every smile is but a gilded mask worn to conceal a countenance of cold design. This house, which seems a fortress of good fellowship, is but a stage for secret wars.
