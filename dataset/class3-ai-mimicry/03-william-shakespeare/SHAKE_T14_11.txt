Wherefore do these multitudes swarm so upon the cobbles? Each visage a mask of earnest purpose, each hurried step a seeming choice; yet I do perceive it all as a great and witless contrivance. They fancy they direct their own feet, one to the market, another to his hearth, but I see them only as a tide of flesh, pulled by some moon they cannot spy. And what am I, but a single drop within this human torrent, my own small motion a thing of no account? To claim my late offence was of mine own device is but a fool’s conceit; nay, I was but an eddy in the greater flow, a finger of the city’s vast hand that moved as it was bid. We are all but painted players in a dumb show, mistaking our frantic gestures for a will that was never ours to command.
