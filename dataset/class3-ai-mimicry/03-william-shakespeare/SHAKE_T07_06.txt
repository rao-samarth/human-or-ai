Spur on! Spur on, I say, lest the dusk betray us to these rogues! For look you there, where the Duke's own standard lies trampled in the mire, its silken lion befoul'd by peasant hands and torn asunder. What devil's courage doth possess these churls to so defy their sovereign lord? By heaven, the very air grows thick with treason, and every shadow seems to clutch a farmer's scythe, new-sharpened not for harvest, but for a far bloodier reaping. They have barred the toll-gate with a ploughman's cart and hung the tax collector's effigy from the gallows-oak, a straw-stuffed mockery of the law's long reach. Ride, ride for your lives! The very cobblestones cry out for vengeance, and I'll not be caught when this foul storm of mutiny doth break at last upon our heads.
