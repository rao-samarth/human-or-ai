You speak of vows sworn, of covenants made in the sight of men and heaven; of legacies writ by a father’s hand ere he was dust. But what is a vow when the soul itself doth cry rebellion? A word, a mere vapour upon the winter air, signifying naught but the bondage of the tongue. For my heart, that traitorous vessel, hath long since sailed to a foreign shore and will not be call’d home by any decree, no matter how justly penn’d or loudly proclaim’d. This gilded cage of honour you present is but a prison still, and you would have me sing within it. Must I, then, play the contented martyr and sunder mine own spirit upon the altar of your expectation? Nay, I ask you plainly: wherein lies the virtue of a life lived as a ghost, celebrated for its obedience yet barren of all true feeling? Such a path is not honour; ’tis a slow and artful death.
