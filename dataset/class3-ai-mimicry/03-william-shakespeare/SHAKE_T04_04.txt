My dearest Philip, what ill report is this that finds me leagues from home, a cruel whisper carried on the merchant’s wind? I am told thy loyalties have shifted with the season, that the coin of a richer patron now outweighs the long-held bond of our sworn brotherhood. Dost thou now smile upon the man whose very shadow I did teach thee to despise, and call him friend? Pray, tell me this is but the cunning lie of a jealous rival, for my mind cannot fashion such a treason from the man I knew. Yet this long and lonely road gives such dark thoughts too much soil in which to grow, and my heart, which was thy staunchest fortress, begins to feel the siege of doubt. A single word from thee would scatter these besieging armies, but thy silence is a battering ram against the gate.
