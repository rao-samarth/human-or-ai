Mark you how yon poetaster doth hold court, as if his very breath were perfumed with ambrosia for these gaping fools to inhale. His latest string of couplets, so limp they could not hang a flea, are lauded as the finest words since tongues first learned to wag. A pox on such cheap renown! For when one man is lifted so high upon the shoulders of the crowd, his shadow falls like a chilling blight upon all others who stand below, making their own modest light seem a pitiful flicker. This poison, brewed in the alembic of another’s fortune, is a most subtle and grievous malady; it needs no wound to enter, yet it sickens the heart and makes a man see worms in every dish and treason in every smile. Let them cheer; their hollow praise will soon enough turn to a cough, and we shall see what worth his rhymes possess then.
