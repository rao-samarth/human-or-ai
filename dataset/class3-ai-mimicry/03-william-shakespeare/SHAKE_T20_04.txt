Observe this righteous traveling companion of mine, who with every lurch of the carriage doth pronounce a homily on the virtues of humility and the sin of worldly attachment. Fie! His tongue may preach of sackcloth and ashes, yet his fingers, look you, they fret the velvet of his doublet as a lover might a maiden's hair. He chides the innkeeper for a costly flagon of wine, decrying such excess as an offense to heaven, but then complains most bitterly that his bedchamber lacks a feather mattress for his precious, saintly bones. O, what a cunning pageant doth a man perform for God and his fellows, when his truest worship is offered only at the altar of his own comfort; a grand player upon a dusty stage, whose every pious word is but a prologue to some fresh and selfish deed.
