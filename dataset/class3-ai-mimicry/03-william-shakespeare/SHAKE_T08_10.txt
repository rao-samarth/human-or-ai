Upon the silent crossroads, where one dusty track did lead to the town's cold magistrate and the other to his neighbour's slumbering fields, the yeoman paused. A bitter draught it is, to swallow a deep grievance and trust its measure to another's scales; for what man can truly weigh a wound he hath not felt? The law, he mused, oft proves a slow and toothless beast, whilst the hot blood cries for a reckoning of its own fierce making. A swift stroke, an eye for an eye, until the scales are not merely balanced but broken altogether under the weight of satisfaction. Yet what power grants this right? If every wronged soul becomes his own judge, what then is the world but a wilderness of warring sorrows, where no man is safe from his brother's rage? He knew not which path held the truer course, only that one promised a cold peace and the other a burning one.
