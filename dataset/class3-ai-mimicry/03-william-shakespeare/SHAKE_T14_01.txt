Prithee, speak no more of what your will hath wrought, nor of some grand celestial map that guides your feet. Dost thou truly think the heavens attend so closely to the scurrying of one man? 'Tis a pretty vanity, I grant you. We are as children's toys cast down a muddy hill; we roll and tumble, striking this rock or that, and at the bottom boast of the clever path we navigated. A clever path! Nay, 'twas but gravity and a witless shove that brought us to our rest, a journey directed by the slope and the mire. Your great ambition is no more than the speed of your descent, and your triumphs but the fortunate ruts you chanced to fall into. Call it what you will—fortune, the gods' design, or the work of your own mighty hand—it is all one. It is the hill, sir, and we but the stones that fall upon it.
