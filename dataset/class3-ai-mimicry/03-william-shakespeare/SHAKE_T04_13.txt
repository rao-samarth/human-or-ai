I take up my quill with a heavy heart, for it seems the very air betwixt us has grown thin and cold. Since this new magistrate, with his fine silks and promises of advancement, hath come to hold court in our small town, I find your ear is given wholly to his flattering tongue, whilst mine own counsel is counted as naught. Dost thou so quickly forget those vows we made by the old riverbank, where we swore a bond proof against all worldly storms? It grieves me to see a friendship, forged in the honest fire of youth and hardship, now cooled and made brittle by the mere prospect of a higher station. A true companion's worth, methinks, is not a coin to be weighed against a patron's favour, nor is loyalty a cloak to be cast off when a richer one is offered. Take heed, for the ladder of ambition is a lonely perch, and you may find, when you look down, that the hands which would have caught you are no longer there.
