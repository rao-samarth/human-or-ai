Master Hemlock doth praise the youth for his most earnest industry, and indeed, the fellow’s quill doth fly across the ledger with a speed that shames my own worn hand. He bows his head in such a humble cast, a perfect model of a loyal clerk whose only joy is in his master’s gain. But what art is this, to wear a face so studied in its honesty? I have marked his glance, when he thinks none do watch, how it alights upon the master’s coffers with a hungry, calculating gleam. He speaks in honeyed words of fealty, yet his true heart whispers only of advantage and of coin. This painted devotion, this gilded cage of pretty falsehoods, will one day prove a bitter poison to our house; for a mask, however finely wrought, must at the last be rent, and then what monstrous visage shall be shown to all?
