The lutes and viols sound the call, a summons to this public, joyless rite, and my father’s gaze is a sharp and silent spur upon my heel. I am bid to take my lady’s hand, whose touch, I know, holds no more warmth than the waxen seal upon our houses’ pact. Yet mine own eyes, those rebels to my will, do seek another visage in the throng, one whose mere glance sets my true heart alight and makes a mockery of this gilded cage. O, what a hollow pageant is this court, where I must smile and bow and lead this measure, a painted puppet moved by honour’s string! My feet must trace the pattern of my fate upon this polished floor, whilst all my spirit doth strain against its chain and cries out for a freedom it can ne’er possess. Hath ever duty worn so harsh a face, or a sworn vow been such a heavy stone upon the soul?
