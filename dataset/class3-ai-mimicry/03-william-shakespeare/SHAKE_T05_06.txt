By this guttering candlelight, I am to play the scholar and weigh two worlds upon a scale. Here, this heavy seal of office, this bond that ties my name to lands I’ve never trod and faces I'll ne'er abide; and there, a memory of some fleeting warmth, a foolish fancy that dares call itself eternal. Forsooth, what a grand and tragic stage is this! Am I to cast away a dynasty for a handful of pretty words and a quickening of the pulse? Let the poets prattle of hearts entwined; my heart is but a leaden cog in a great and grinding clockwork, and it must keep its time. To choose a sigh over a signature were the act of a madman, and though I may be many things, a madman I am not. Not yet.
