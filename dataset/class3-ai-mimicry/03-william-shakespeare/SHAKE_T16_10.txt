Hark, what poison doth our governor pour into the very ears of this assembly? He speaks of futures bright and profits yet uncounted, but his logic is a ship with a rotten hull, charting a course straight upon the rocks. And I, a lowly clerk, must I hold my peace whilst all about me nod their witless heads? My tongue feels a leaden weight, for to speak against him is to court a swift dismissal, to lose my station and my bread. Yet, to stay these words is to be a silent partner in this coming ruin, to watch our whole enterprise founder whilst I, the knowing watchman, say naught. A coward's part, and a fool's. A cold sweat doth bead my brow, and my heart hammers a frantic drum against my ribs; still, the truth, like a restless spirit, demands its voice be given. I must stand.
