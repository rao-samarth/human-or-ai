This rattling carriage doth mock my very soul; it jolts ever forward, yet I am shackled to the man I was. I sought a lofty station, or what seemed such in my youthful folly, and for its hollow gleam I traded honest sleep and a companion’s sacred trust. Tell me, friend, what profit is there in this gilded cage upon wheels, when the conscience within is so sore afflicted? The lands I purchased with such bitter coin stretch barren before my sight, and every league we travel but measures the vast distance from my own grace. I have climbed so high upon a ladder of my own devising, only to find the air thin and the view a desolate waste. I fear the inn we seek this night shall offer no true rest, for what comfort can be found for a spirit that hath bartered its own peace for an empty name?
