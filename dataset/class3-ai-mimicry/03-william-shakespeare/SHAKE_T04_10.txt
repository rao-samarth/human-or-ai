What a cacophony this city doth make, a thousand carts and voices all striving for purchase in a world that offers none. I watch the throngs of men, their faces masks of haste and want, and see in them the very sickness that hath taken hold of my once-dearest companion. Hath he forgotten so soon those vows we swore when our fortunes were but lean? It seems a purse well-lined with silver is a heavier matter than a soul bound by fealty. He walks now with new lords, his laughter mingling with theirs, a sound as hollow to my ear as a cracked bell. Wherefore doth worldly gain so poison the wellspring of a faithful heart? I fear I have lost him not to any foe or foul mischance, but to the simple, gilded promise of a higher station, a bargain that makes a beggar of all true affection.
