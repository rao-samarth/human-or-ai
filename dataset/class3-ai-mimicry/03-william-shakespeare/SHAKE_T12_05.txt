The Duke's great hall doth shimmer with a thousand candles, and the music plays a merry tune to which none seem to listen. For mark you how the silken lords and ladies press about our host, their smiles as false as painted fruit, their tongues gilded with such flattery as would make a statue blush. They whisper promises and bow so low their very spines must cry for mercy, each one hoping for a scrap of favour, a single coin to fall from that great mountain of his wealth. A pitiful contest, methinks, to sell one’s soul for so slight a price. But I shall not join their hungry pack; nay, let them feast upon their empty hopes. A strange lightness fills my heart to watch them, a freedom in my poverty they cannot know. For what jewel is more precious than a mind at peace, and what kingdom richer than a spirit that is its own master? Let them have their gold; I have found a truer prize this night.
