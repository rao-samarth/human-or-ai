Where now is that high countenance thou didst so lately wear, that strutting gait which seemed to scorn the very earth it trod upon? I see it shrunk to a most piteous measure; thy courage fled and all thy glorious feathers plucked by common censure. Dost thou not feel the chill? The world, which once did hang upon thy every gilded word, now makes thy ruin its chiefest sport, and the same mouths that praised thy wit now feast upon thy folly. Thou didst fashion for thyself a crown of sunbeams, believing thy own light could never suffer an eclipse, yet here thou standest in the shadow of thine own prodigious vanity. Mark how low a man may be brought by reaching for a star he cannot hold; thou hast built thy house upon a peak of brittle ice and wert a fool to marvel when the sun did melt its base.
