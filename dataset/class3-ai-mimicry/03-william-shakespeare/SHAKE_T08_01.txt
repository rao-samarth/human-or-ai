This craven boy, this ledger-snake, hath poisoned my good name with whispers and stolen fruits of my own sweat and toil; now fortune puts the whip into my hand. Shall I then lay but one single stripe upon his back, to show the Master the plain truth of his deceit? That would be a kind of equity, a simple setting-right of a tilted scale. Yet my very blood cries out for more—to see him broken, beggared, and cast into the street, his future a barren waste for what he’s done to mine. But tell me, where doth the righting of a wrong end, and a ravenous feasting on another’s ruin begin? When a man’s own fury is the judge, the law, and the headsman all in one, he risks condemning not the villain afore him, but the very honour of his own heart.
