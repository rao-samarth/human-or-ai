I cannot look upon my neighbour’s house but that a canker grows within my soul. Whence came the gold for that new gate, I ask you? Or the silk for his wife’s Sunday bonnet? But yesterday, it seems, he was a man like me, content with ale and a mended coat; now he struts as if the very cobblestones should bow to him. The smiles he gives me now seem nought but pity, and I do fancy that his laughter in the market square is aimed at my own humble lot. His good fortune is a poison in my cup, turning my own bread to ash within my mouth. His every gain feels like a theft from my own purse, and this suspicion, this bitter gall, doth make a villain of an honest man and a prison of this once-pleasant street.
