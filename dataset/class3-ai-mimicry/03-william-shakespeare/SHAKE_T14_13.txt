This sudden lurch, which so affrights your heart, you blame it on the poor fellow who holds the leather; but I say, look you to the road itself, which was made long ere he was born. We fancy ourselves the masters of the journey, our own will the firm hand upon the reins, choosing this way and not that. Yet see how the ruts are worn deep by a thousand wheels before our own; we but follow in the groove, and call it guidance. Perchance we may turn at the next crossing, or so we boast in the sunshine of a fair morning. But what if the axle breaks? What if the heavens themselves let loose a torrent, and make of this firm ground a swallowing mire? Nay, we are but freight, jostled by a design we cannot see, and our grandest choice is merely to praise the view or curse the bumps along the way.
