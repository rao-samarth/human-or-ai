You ask me, good sir, from this high window whence I observe the world, if I believe each man steers his own poor vessel through the tide of things. Look you upon this heaving thoroughfare, this river of flesh and bone that floods the lanes below. Doth this one, who buys his bread, or that one, who hastens to a lover's call, truly carve his passage from his own desire? Or are they all but witless drops of rain, compelled to a course they cannot know, which courses to a sea they ne'er will see? I confess my soul is vexed; for whilst each separate face doth boast a private thought and some determined aim, the great and mighty press of them all moves but as one body, obedient to some hidden moon it cannot name, and for a purpose it hath not divined.
