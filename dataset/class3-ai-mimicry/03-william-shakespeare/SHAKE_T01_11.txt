Behold my good brother-in-law, who sits as master of this festive board, though our own father yet lives and breathes. His every gesture is a studied grace, his words are weighed like coins of purest gold, and all our kin do hang upon his pronouncements. He hath ascended the steep stair of this world's esteem, rung by slippery rung, to a great and lofty height. Yet I mark the shadow in his eye, the small and private tremor in his hand when he lifts his cup; a weariness his fine silks cannot conceal. For what profiteth a man to gain the whole estate, if in the getting he must misplace his own heart? He hath made a desert of his conscience to build this gilded mansion, and now must wander its lonely halls, a king of dust and echoes, whose only subjects are the ghosts of better choices.
