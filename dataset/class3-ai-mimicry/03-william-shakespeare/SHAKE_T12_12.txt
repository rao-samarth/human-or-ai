This heavy coffer, bound with iron stout, doth mock my poverty with its dull gleam. How simple 'twere to lift but one small part—a trifling sum, a pittance from the whole—to ease the private woe that gnaws my heart and keeps me waking in the dead of night. Who, I ask, would take account of it? The slumbering burghers, fat with their content, believe their tithe is safe within my keep; the town’s own ledger, writ in my own hand, would tell no tale of such a petty theft. Yet, my good name, a thing I once held dearer than my life, shrinks from the deed, and my own conscience cries out villain. But what is conscience to a man in want? A hollow echo in an empty purse. The gold itself sings a more persuasive song, a siren’s tune to which my wretched soul must dance, or be forevermore undone.
