Hark, my sweet, and lend thine ear above this market’s clamour. Wherefore dost thou weep? Think not that the king’s commission and my sworn vow to thee are two warring masters in my breast, for they are not. Nay, they are as the sword and the shield, each giving the other purpose. My oath to the realm doth make me a man of honour, fit to claim thy hand; and thy love, a truer thing than any banner, shall be the very armour 'gainst my heart to see me home again. Therefore, let no tear fall. This solemn charge I go to meet is but the harsh and stony path that leads me back, more worthy, to the paradise of thy embrace. Our affections and my fealty shall not be sundered, but shall rise together, triumphant.
