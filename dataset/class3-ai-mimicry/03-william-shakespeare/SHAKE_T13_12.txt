By the guttering candle’s light, he doth stare into the polished silver as if it might return a king, and not the whey-faced coward it finds there. What a clamour he made this morn! His voice, a trumpet proclaiming his own certain victory, is now but a mouse’s squeak caught in his throat. Oh, how the great sun of his own esteem hath set so foully in a puddle of his making. He traces the line of his jaw, a feature he once deemed carved by the gods themselves, and finds it now mere common clay, and soft at that. Let him stand there till the cock crows; the glass will not lie for him, nor will the coming day forget the spectacle of his grand undoing. A pity, is it not, that mirrors show not what’s within? For his soul would be a shrunken, pitiful thing indeed.
