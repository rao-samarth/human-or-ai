This endless river of men, this clatter of carts and shouting costermongers, doth make my head to ache. See there, how they pursue that wretch, his crime writ plain upon his fearful face. They cry for satisfaction, and mean to have it with their boots and fists, believing the scales are balanced when a wrong is answered with a greater wrong. The magistrate, in his cold hall, would measure out the lash with careful count, a punishment to fit the trespass. But this is a wilder sort of reckoning, born of hot blood and the roaring of the aggrieved soul, which will not be contented with a judge's sober word. And who is to say their fire is misplaced? For when the wound is fresh, the heart itself doth clamour for a balm of equal pain, and calls this raw desire a holy thing, a rightness that the statutes cannot know.
