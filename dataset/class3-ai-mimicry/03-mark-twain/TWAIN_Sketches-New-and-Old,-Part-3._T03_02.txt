I do wish you were here, my friend, for this hotel lobby furnishes more theater than any proper stage I know. Just yesterday, I overheard a gentleman of considerable girth and even more considerable volume lay out his plans for a fishing trip that would have humbled the apostles themselves. He spoke of leviathans lurking in the local stream, of battles of wit and sinew against legendary trout, and of a grand fish-fry to follow that would feed the entire county. His pronouncements were so thunderous that a sleeping dog two chairs down yelped and fled the scene. Well, I saw him return not an hour ago—his magnificent fishing pole was snapped clean in two, his hat was missing, and the only thing he carried was a soggy boot with a small, indignant crawdad clinging to its heel. His wife followed behind him, carrying a string of fish from the market, and she wore an expression of such serene, practiced patience that it ought to be put on a coin.
