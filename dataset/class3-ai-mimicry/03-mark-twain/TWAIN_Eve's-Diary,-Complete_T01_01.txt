A man can plant himself on the same park bench for forty years, I reckon, and convince himself he knows every last secret the city has to tell; he’s seen the scurry of businessmen with their important papers, the slow amble of lovers who think their story is brand new, and the everlasting, clamorous nonsense of wagons and automobiles. He figures he has it all measured and cataloged. And then one afternoon, with the sun hanging low and tired, his eye catches on a thing he’s never before bothered to see—a little patch of damp stone between the slats of the bench, where a civilization of green moss has set up its own silent metropolis. It’s got tiny avenues and little fuzzy hills, a whole world conducting its affairs without a lick of noise or hurry. A fellow feels mighty small then, and a good deal lonesome, discovering he’s been overlooking the most peaceful country on earth, right under his own nose.
