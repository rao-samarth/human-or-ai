When a man dons the uniform of a scoundrel, he’d best not be surprised when the world reckons him a scoundrel, for it has neither the time nor the inclination to inquire after the state of his soul." He sat back then, satisfied, as if he’d just laid down a new and irrefutable commandment from on high.
