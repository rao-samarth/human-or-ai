I was considering a stray acorn the other day, one that a squirrel had fumbled and left to its own devices on the flat of a sun-baked stone. Now, that little nubbin is packed full of all the ambition required to become a mighty oak—it’s got the whole plan right inside it—but the sun will parch it and the rain will wash it away, and that will be the end of its grand career. Its brother, a half-dozen feet away, happened to land in a patch of good, dark earth, and it will likely be shading my great-grandchildren long after I’ve been forgotten. And it strikes me that a man is much the same; he doesn't get to choose the soil he's planted in, whether it be a library or a tavern, and all the high-minded talk about character and grit don't amount to a hill of beans when the ground itself is barren. A fella is just the machinery his surroundings build, and he ain't the architect.
