Mr. Abernathy cleared his throat with the gravity of a country parson about to condemn a soul, though the only sin in evidence was the slow theft of an afternoon. He consulted a sheaf of papers, a holy writ filled with charts and figures that pretended to measure a man’s spirit by the number of correspondences he had answered. I sat opposite, a willing captive in a starched collar, and listened to the accounting of my own tabulated virtues and itemized deficiencies—a kind of pre-written eulogy for a fella who wasn't even dead yet, just employed. He spoke of ‘synergistic frameworks’ and ‘stakeholder engagement,’ and the words hung in the stale air like cheap perfume, signifying nothing but the speaker’s profound belief in their importance. When the sermon concluded, we shook hands with the solemnity of two nations signing a treaty to ensure mutual misery, and I knew for certain we would perform this same sad pageant again in a year’s time.
