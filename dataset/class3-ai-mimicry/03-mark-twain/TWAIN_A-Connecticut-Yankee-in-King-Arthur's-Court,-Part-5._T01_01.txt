The old woman, her face a mess of shadows by the single guttering candle, swore the house was held by ancient wards, bound by incantations whispered when the world was young. She claimed no man could bring a harm or a harsh light into this consecrated space, a notion that struck me as pure flapdoodle. Well, I’ve never been one for such talk, and patience is a virtue I am famously short on. I pulled the little generator from my satchel, a rattling contraption of copper and steel, and with a yank of the cord it coughed to life with a racket fit to wake the dead—a far more practical method than trying to bargain with them, I find. "Ma'am," I said over the din, flipping the switch on the electric lamp, which blazed forth and washed the very soul out of her precious shadows, "your spirits might be powerful, but they seem to have a mighty aversion to this bit of lightning I've got tamed in a jar. It appears progress, unlike a ghost, isn't so easily scared off by a few rhyming words."
