I watched a fellow just now, a man in a perpetual state of perspiration and panic, who seemed to be at war with his own guidebook. He would charge up to some ancient pile of stones, consult the sacred text, nod his head with the grim satisfaction of a tax collector, and then gallop off towards the next designated miracle. His family trailed behind him like a string of weary pack-mules. Here was a man determined to digest a thousand years of history in a single afternoon, a feat which would give indigestion to a stone golem. He wasn't collecting memories, you see; he was collecting proofs of presence. He could now go home and swear on a stack of Bibles that he had *been* there, and he'd have the blurry photograph of his own thumb to prove it. A sad business, altogether.
