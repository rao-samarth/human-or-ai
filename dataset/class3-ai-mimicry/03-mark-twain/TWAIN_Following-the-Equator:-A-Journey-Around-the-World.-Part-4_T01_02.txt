My uncle, red-faced and puffed up with Sunday roast, slammed his fist on the dining table, rattling the good china. “It is a matter of simple progress, I tell you—a moral imperative! We are delivering those poor, benighted souls from their own squalor, bringing them the glorious light of civilization!” Young Thomas, back only a week from his sea voyage and looking mighty thin for it, set down his fork with a deliberate clink. “Civilization, is it? It’s a peculiar sort of light that requires so much gunpowder to spread, Uncle. It seems to me we’ve taught them a great many things, chief among them the proper market value of their own ancestral graves and the astonishing speed with which a man’s home can disappear from under his feet once a contract he can’t read is signed. We haven’t delivered them from anything but their own peace and quiet, and we’ve done it with a Bible in one hand and a bill of sale in the other.”
