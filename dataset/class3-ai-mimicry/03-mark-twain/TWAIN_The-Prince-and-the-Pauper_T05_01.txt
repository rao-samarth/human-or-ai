I sat there in the corner, nursing a lukewarm sarsaparilla and watching the whole fool parade of my kin. It does beat all, the way a man’s pockets can swell him up in the eyes of his relations, making him a giant where before he was just a boy with scuffed knees and a middling sense of direction. There was my nephew, who’d made a name for himself back east selling something useless to people who didn’t need it, and you’d have thought he was a visiting king the way they hung on his every pronouncement. Meanwhile, his own father, a man who never spoke a dishonest word and could calm a spooked horse with just a whisper, sat by the hearth, whittling a piece of scrap wood and noticed only by the cat. The whole affair had the feel of a poorly rehearsed play where the actors admired the shine on one man’s boots and paid no mind to the soul residing in another’s. I reckon that’s a truth as old and sorrowful as the dirt we’ll all end up under.
