There is a particular sort of well-meaning man, often found behind a polished desk, who has never known a truly hungry day or a sleepless night spent worrying over a sick child. His benevolence, therefore, is of a theoretical and bloodless kind, dispensed like a dry biscuit from a high shelf. Our new supervisor, Mr. Abernathy, was just such a man; he saw a fellow's financial predicament not as a human struggle, but as a simple failure of arithmetic, to be corrected with a stern lecture on fiscal responsibility—a virtue he himself had never been required to practice. But then his own troubles commenced, a string of quiet misfortunes that left his face pale and his fine suit looking a size too large for him. And a curious thing happened. When old Finch came in late last Tuesday, looking haggard, Abernathy didn’t deliver the customary reprimand. Instead, he just looked at him for a long moment, a sort of weary recognition in his eyes, and quietly asked if a cup of hot coffee might help matters. It seems a man must be properly shipwrecked himself before he can truly understand what it is to be drowning.
