Well, I saw a fine spectacle of jurisprudence the other day that’d make a stone cherub bust its sides laughing. Down on a corner so choked with humanity you could hardly spit, two vendors were having it out—one selling hot chestnuts that smelled of honest labor, the other pushing a bottle of brown sludge he swore would regrow a man’s hair and his moral fiber besides. A pompous little man in a starched collar, looking as if he’d just had a big breakfast of rules and regulations, stepped in to mediate. He went on and on about city ordinances and the equitable distribution of commerce, a whole dictionary of nonsense that meant precisely nothing to a man whose entire fortune was tied up in a bucket of coals. I reckon the only justice that matters on a city street is the kind you learn firsthand: the fellow who can pack his cart and skedaddle a half-second before the constable rounds the corner is the one who’s truly in the right. The rest is just fancy talk to keep the lawyers fed.
