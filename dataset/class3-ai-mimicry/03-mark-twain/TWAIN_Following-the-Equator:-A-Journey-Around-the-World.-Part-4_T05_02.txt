I came upon Deacon Abernathy preening over the new edifice he’d constructed to cap the town well, a gaudy affair of polished pine and iron scrollwork that looked more suited to a city cemetery than our dusty square. “A humble offering for the public good,” he said, puffing out his chest so far I worried for the integrity of his waistcoat buttons. “A man must do his part, you see.” His definition of “humble” was a peculiar one, for his name was carved into the main beam in letters so conspicuous a man could read them from the church steeple on a cloudy day. I pointed a thumb at the grand lettering. “Just so folks know who to thank, I suppose?” He blushed—a feat of some accomplishment—and declared it a simple marker, lest the Lord’s work be misattributed. I figured the Lord wasn’t in much danger of forgetting who supplied the lumber, but I allowed the Deacon his victory; a man so determined to advertise his own modesty is an affliction best left to cure itself.
