I do believe a man’s soul is measured not by his Sunday preachings but by his conduct in the face of another’s weeping. My cousin Martha was in the parlor, producing a veritable monsoon over some trivial domestic calamity—a lost brooch, I think it was—and the room sorted itself out right quick. Her sister Beatrice, a woman whose gravest affliction had been a mismatched pair of gloves, began a grand palaver on the virtues of fortitude, a regular sermon that would’ve put a parson to sleep. But it was our quiet uncle, a man who’d seen his own fortunes crumble to dust more than once, who understood the proper medicine. He didn't offer a single word of high-minded humbug; no, he just fetched her a glass of water and sat beside her until the storm passed. A fellow who’s never been truly soaked to the bone has precious little to say about the nature of rain, except to complain that it’s wet.
