Deacon Henshaw had me cornered by the dry goods counter, his face so pinched with piety you’d think he was about to sprout wings and float right through the ceiling. “It’s a matter of public decency,” he whispered, his breath smelling of sour pickles and scripture. “That fiddler fellow, holding his dances right up to midnight—it’s an open invitation to perdition, a moral stain! We, as the Lord’s appointed stewards, must purchase that corrupting parcel of his and consecrate it with a new prayer hall.” He leaned closer, a conspiratorial gleam in his eye that had nothing to do with saving souls and everything to do with the fact the proposed railroad spur was rumored to cut directly through that fiddler’s property. I just looked at him. “Deacon,” I said, slow and deliberate, “I never figured the path to salvation was paved with surveyor’s stakes, but I suppose the Almighty works in ways that are as mysterious as they are profitable.” A terrible silence fell between us then, thicker and more honest than any sermon he’d ever given.
