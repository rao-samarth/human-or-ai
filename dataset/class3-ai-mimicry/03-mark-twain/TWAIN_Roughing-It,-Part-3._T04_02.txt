The silence that followed my little oration was of a particularly thick and suffocating variety, the kind you could slice up and serve for dessert. Every eye in that chandeliered ballroom—eyes belonging to bankers and politicians and their corseted wives—was fixed upon me as if I were a three-headed calf at the county fair; a marvel of misfortune, but a disagreeable one. I was supposed to be selling them on the virtues of a new-fangled steam pump, a contraption I understood about as well as a hog understands Sunday. And in that grand, echoing quiet, a perplexing truth landed on me like a ton of bricks: I was a spectacular failure at this sort of business. Now, the sensible course was to grovel, to make some self-deprecating jest and try to mend the fences. But a far more rascally and liberating notion whispered that I ought to just tip my hat and find some honest work, even if it was just piloting a mud-scow. A man can fail at a thing he hates a thousand times, but to succeed at it—well, that seemed a far more permanent and miserable damnation.
