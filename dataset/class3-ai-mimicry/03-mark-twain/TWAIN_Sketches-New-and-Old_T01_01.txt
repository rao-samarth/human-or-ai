You never saw such a commotion as when my Aunt Elspeth unveiled her new Cerebral Vitalizer, a contraption of polished nickel and coiled wire that a fast-talking gentleman from back east had sold her for the price of a good mule. She claimed it could align a person’s humors and improve their standing in the community, though it seemed to do little more than hum like a horsefly in a jar and make your hair stand on end if you got too near. Yet there they were, the whole clan, all leaning in with their mouths agape, waiting for a jolt of what she called “electro-magnetic grace.” My cousin Jebediah, who can't tell a hawk from a handsaw, swore he felt his wits sharpen right up. A man will believe most any fool thing if it’s presented with enough shiny brass and solemn nonsense; he'll convince himself he’s a genius just to prove his money wasn’t wasted on a glorified static machine.
