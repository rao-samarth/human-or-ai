The General, resplendent in a uniform that seemed to carry more gold braid than a Mississippi riverboat, endured the evening’s festivities with the grim patience of a man awaiting a tooth-pulling. The air, thick with expensive perfume and cheap self-congratulation, rang with toasts to his sagacity and courage—though he knew full well that sagacity was often just dumb luck that hadn't yet run out. Every hand he shook felt like a fresh claim staked upon his soul; every fawning compliment was but a down payment on some future, impossible demand. They saw a hero, a figure carved from granite and victory, but he felt more like the town bookkeeper, eternally staring at a set of ledgers where the debits always outstripped the credits. He would trade all this suffocating glory—the whole blessed, glittering affair—for five minutes of honest solitude, a quiet pipe, and the simple peace of not having the fate of a thousand clamoring fools resting squarely upon his epaulets.
