A feller can get mighty discouraged in the full-steam-ahead crush of a city, where the tide of humanity threatens to wash away any notion of his own particular consequence. I saw a man just yesterday, a sad sort of specimen with a coat that had given up and boots that had lost their faith, and he was being carried along by the crowd like a piece of driftwood. Then, a curious thing. He stopped by a window-box, plucked a stray violet that had tumbled to the sill, and fixed it in his lapel. Well, sir, you'd think he'd just been elected mayor. His spine found its long-lost calling, his chin lifted as if to inspect the weather, and his feet—those same defeated feet—began to strike the pavement with a definite purpose. It was a grand spectacle, a reminder that a man is not merely what he wears, but that a simple, hopeful decoration can sometimes call forth the gentleman who was hiding inside the coat all along.
