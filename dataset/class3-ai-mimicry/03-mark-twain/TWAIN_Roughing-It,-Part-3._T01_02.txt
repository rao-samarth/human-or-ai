There was my cousin Bartholomew, puffed up like a toad on a hot rock, holding court by the punch bowl where he had lately taken up residence. He’d come into a handsome sum through some patent medicine speculation—a business about as solid as a fog bank—and now he sported a watch chain heavy enough to anchor a small skiff. He was explaining to all the assembled relations, with the air of a man who’d personally invented currency, how his fortune was the direct result of superior intellect and gumption. Well, I’ve seen a summer flood rise just as fast and with just as much commotion, and I’ve seen it retreat just as quick, leaving behind nothing but mud and busted fences. I gave him ’til Christmas, I did. A man who stumbles upon a windfall is merely a man with a heavier pocket for a short spell, and gravity, you see, has a way of working on both with an uncommon persistence.
