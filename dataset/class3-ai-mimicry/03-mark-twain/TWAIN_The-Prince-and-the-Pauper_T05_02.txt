A man’s true measure in our town, I have long observed, has precious little to do with the work he can accomplish with his own two hands. Let the new circuit judge pass by—a man whose chief talent is a fine collection of starched collars and an ability for looking solemn—and the whole street commences to bowing and scraping like he was a visiting potentate dispensing royal favors. Yet, old Silas, who has set nearly every foundation stone on Main Street and whose patient work will outlive the judge and all his windy pronouncements by a century, he can pass by with naught but a nod and a grunt, and folks barely turn their heads. It is a peculiar sort of arithmetic, where the weight of a man’s reputation is calculated by the noise he makes and not by the silent, sturdy things he leaves behind. We seem to value the gilt-edged promise far more than the proven fact; a predicament, I reckon, that keeps a good many honest men in shabby coats and a good many scoundrels in silk.
