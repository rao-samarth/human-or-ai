Aunt Matilda was making a grand and thunderous inquiry concerning the missing corner of her peach cobbler, a confection which, by all adult proclamation, was not to be so much as glanced at before the supper bell. Now, I had personally witnessed my cousin Samuel, that pious little lickspittle who never missed a prayer, slink into the pantry and procure the piece for himself, yet here he stood with an angel’s own innocence upon his face. The whole congregation of aunts and uncles turned their suspicious eyes upon me, as was their custom in any matter of household crime, leaving me in a vexatious pickle. For the law of the schoolyard is plain: you never snitch, not even on a scoundrel you’d happily see dropped down a well. But the grown-up law, the one they preach from the pulpit, demands a brand of truth-telling that feels mightily like betrayal. I stood there, weighing the sin of the lie against the everlasting damnation of being a tattletale, and reckoned the Almighty’s rules must get terribly tangled and confused once a man puts on long trousers.
