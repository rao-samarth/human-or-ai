I found myself at a dinner where the air was thick with the scent of roasted duck and pious pronouncements. A portly gentleman, whose fortune was built upon a mountain of questionable railroad bonds, was lecturing a younger man on the unbreakable virtue of an honest day’s work. It all seemed a familiar sort of play-acting. I was raised on stories of good boys who told the truth and were rewarded with a clear conscience and, if they were lucky, a shiny new penny; the scoundrels, of course, always met a grim and instructive end. But as I looked around that polished room at the men whose ledgers were monuments to clever treachery, I saw no signs of impending doom—only well-fed contentment. It struck me then, with a quiet and hollow sort of certainty, that the little moral fables of our youth are not guideposts for navigating the world, but rather a comforting sort of map to a country that does not exist.
