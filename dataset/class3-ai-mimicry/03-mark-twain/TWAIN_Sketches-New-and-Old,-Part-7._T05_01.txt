I stood on a street corner choked with the clatter of new inventions and the self-satisfied pronouncements of men who believed they had finally outsmarted history itself. They had contraptions to carry them faster, wires to deliver their urgent nonsense across a continent, and towers that scraped at the clouds—all of it designed, they swore, for the general betterment of the race. And yet, a man will invent a machine to do the work of fifty good men and then congratulate himself on his genius while the other forty-nine look for bread. He will fashion a new political philosophy to right all the world's wrongs, and it will be populated by the very same species of scoundrel that made the old one crooked. It is a grand and perpetual circus, you see; the costumes and the music change with the seasons, the clowns paint their faces in a new and startling fashion, but the trick is always the same, and the audience—bless their hearts—always gasps with the same brand of astonished delight.
