I have found, in the quiet solitude of the late hours when the world has the good sense to be asleep, that a man’s true measure is often in inverse proportion to the grandeur of his explanations. You will encounter a fellow who can discourse for a full hour upon the theoretical complexities of a simple gear-and-pulley system—a man who erects a tremendous scaffolding of jargon and polysyllabic fog around a notion that a child could grasp in a minute. He uses words like “synergistic articulation” to describe a hinge. And the populace, bless their simple hearts, will stand back and admire the sheer architecture of his speech, never once thinking to check if the magnificent structure contains any furniture, or indeed, if it even has a floor. They are so dazzled by the intricate blueprint of his ignorance that they mistake the map for the territory, and applaud the cartographer who has never traveled the road.
