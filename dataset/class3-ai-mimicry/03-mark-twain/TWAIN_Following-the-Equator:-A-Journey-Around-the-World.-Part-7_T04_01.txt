When Cousin Elspeth commenced her public negotiations with the Almighty over the cooling ham, the whole room was taken hostage. It wasn’t so much a prayer as it was a public accounting of her soul’s ledger, read aloud for the benefit of a jury that had not asked to be convened and which was growing hungrier by the second. She confessed to the sin of impatience when the postman was late, a transgression of such magnitude that it seemed to shake the very foundations of the house, and then gave thunderous thanks for being delivered from the temptation of a second slice of pie at last Sunday’s social. You could see the poor woman fairly sweating with the effort of her own virtue, her eyes squeezed shut as if to block out the sight of our unredeemed faces. All the while, Uncle Hiram stared at the gravy boat with the fixed, desperate longing of a man watching his last life raft float away, and I had a considerable notion that the Lord was likely more interested in the state of the roast than in the catalog of Elspeth’s microscopic iniquities.
