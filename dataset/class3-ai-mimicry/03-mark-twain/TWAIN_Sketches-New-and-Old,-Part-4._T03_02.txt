A newcomer to our bustling metropolis would do well to mind his elbows, for the simple reason that a citizen's dignity here is located chiefly in his ribs and is prone to a sudden and violent inflammation. I saw a man, whose primary ambition seemed to be transporting a gooseberry pie through the midday crush, jostle a solemn-looking sort with a jaw like a shovel. That, of course, was the end of the pie and the beginning of the trouble. No apologies were offered, for an apology was an admission of weakness, and weakness was a condition best cured by the coroner. The shovel-jawed fellow didn't challenge him to a duel at dawn—that would have been entirely too private and orderly for our tastes. No, he called for satisfaction on the spot, and the pie-carrier, his dessert now a lost cause, obliged by producing a horse pistol from his coat, and soon half the street had taken an interest. Bets were being laid, not on who would win, mind you, but on which stray shot would finally take out the sign on the milliner’s shop, a topic of much more spirited debate.
