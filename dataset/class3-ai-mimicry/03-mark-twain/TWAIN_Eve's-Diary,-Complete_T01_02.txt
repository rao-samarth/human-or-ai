Silas jabbed a finger that looked like a dried-out parsnip right at Jedediah’s chest, his face a thundercloud of righteous indignation. “You listen to me, boy. You’ve gone and read a book or two and now you reckon you’ve discovered the very blueprint of creation, as if the Good Lord was just waiting for some upstart from Pike County to come along and correct His shoddy penmanship. This contraption of yours—this damnable engine that chuffs and sputters where there ought to be the sound of crickets—it ain’t progress. It’s a pernicious sort of foolishness, a brand of educated ignorance that is the most dangerous kind. You stand there so proud, thinking you’ve opened a door to some grand future, but all I see is a fella who’s so busy looking at the stars he’s forgotten what solid ground feels like, and he’s about to lead the whole town right off a cliff with him.”
