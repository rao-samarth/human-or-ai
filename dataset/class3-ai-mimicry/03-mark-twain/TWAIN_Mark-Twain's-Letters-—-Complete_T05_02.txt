The parlor hums with the familiar drone of my kin, a comfortable music they have composed together their entire lives, each voice a well-worn instrument in the orchestra of home. They trade stories of the county fair and fret over the price of lumber, their opinions as solid and immovable as the hearthstones behind them. I have seen that same unshakeable certainty in a thousand other parlors, in huts of mud and in gilded halls; men arguing the proper way to salt a fish or bow to a king with a conviction that would make the angels weep. They are all so blessedly sure. And I, having seen the hundred contradictory certainties that populate this spinning globe, possess no such comfort. It is a lonely sort of wisdom, this knowledge that every man’s truth is merely the geography of his birth, and it settles upon a man like a fine dust, covering all the bright colors of his own home until they seem just as faded as the rest.
