I saw a fellow on the foredeck of this rickety steamer, all puffed up like a frog with a grudge. He was the owner’s boy, you see, and carried himself as if he’d personally carved the river channel with a pocketknife. He’d strut and holler orders that didn’t need hollering, and the crew, they’d just sort of nod and then go about their business, paying him no more mind than a troublesome horsefly. Then the fog rolled in, thick as buttermilk, and the real pilot—a quiet man with eyes that had seen every snag from here to the gulf—took the wheel. Not a soul questioned him; every man on board suddenly found his posture. It’s a curious thing, ain’t it? A man can inherit a fine coat and a loud voice, but he can’t inherit the trust of men who know a dangerous current when they feel it shivering up through the floorboards. That kind of command has to be earned with a steady hand, not a fancy name.
