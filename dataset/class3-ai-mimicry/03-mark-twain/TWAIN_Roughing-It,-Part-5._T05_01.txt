Young Cousin Bartholomew, whose chief industry was the energetic avoidance of any actual industry, held forth by the fire, his face glowing with the holy light of a guaranteed speculation. He had latched onto a scheme for making paper out of sawdust and promises—a venture so brilliant, he claimed, it would soon render the world’s forests entirely obsolete for anything but shade and bird-nesting. He painted a picture of fortunes amassed so quickly it would make a man’s head swim, and a few of the younger aunts, bless their hearts, seemed to believe him, already mentally redecorating their parlors with phantom profits. But the older uncles, men whose hands were calloused by the unforgiving arithmetic of a day’s labor, simply chewed their tobacco in a slow, rhythmic silence. They understood a plain truth that Bartholomew had yet to learn: a man who chases a dollar that doesn’t have a lick of sweat on it is usually just running a long, roundabout errand to the poorhouse.
