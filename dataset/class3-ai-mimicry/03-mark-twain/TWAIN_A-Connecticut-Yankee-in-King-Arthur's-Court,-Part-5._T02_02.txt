The fire's just about given up its ghost, and here I am, stewing over the same old human foolishness. It’s a brand of nonsense that would make a cat laugh—this whole business of a man puffing out his chest on account of some ancestor who happened to be handy with a sword a few centuries back. We're meant to bow and scrape before his descendant, a fellow who likely couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper sack, all because his great-grand-pappy was a celebrated scoundrel. Meanwhile, a good, honest blacksmith who can shoe a horse and raise a family is considered no more important than the dirt on that lordling’s boot. It’s a queer system of measurement, I’ll tell you. You wouldn’t value a mule based on the racing record of its long-dead sire; you’d value it for its ability to pull a wagon without sitting down in the middle of the road. It seems to me the whole world's got its measuring stick held upside-down.
