To hear my Aunt Prudence carry on, her boy Walter was a regular Napoleon of commerce, a man whose shadow was already falling across the stock exchange with considerable heft. You’d picture a titan, a mover of mountains and markets. The actual Walter, however, was at that moment trying to coax the family dog into a waistcoat, a venture of some difficulty and zero profit. And it struck me then, sitting amongst the clatter of forks and fraudulent biographies, that this is the chief occupation of mankind. We are all of us architects of magnificent phantom futures, building glorious palaces of what-ought-to-be in our heads; then we pass our days living in the humble, drafty shack of what-is, all the while describing the leaky roof to our neighbors as a celestial observatory of the finest glass.
