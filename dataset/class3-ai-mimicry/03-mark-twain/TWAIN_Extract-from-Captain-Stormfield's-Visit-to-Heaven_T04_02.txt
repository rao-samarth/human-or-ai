The train rattled on toward some destination I had already begun to doubt, and across the aisle sat a known scoundrel from the river towns—a fellow whose profession was to separate a fool from his wages with three walnut shells and a quick hand. He watched a weary woman with two hollow-eyed children for a good long while, and then, with no ceremony at all, he produced a parcel of fried chicken and biscuits and pressed a silver dollar into the mother’s hand, muttering some flimsy excuse about a prodigious breakfast. Now, the Good Book, as interpreted by men whose collars are a bit too tight, has a very particular and rather drafty accommodation for such a man in the hereafter. And yet, I found myself in a considerable pickle, for I could not picture a celestial perpetuity of any genuine interest that did not have room for that sort of spontaneous charity. If the Almighty’s grand hotel has no vacancy for a kind-hearted rascal, then it must be a mighty exclusive and, I suspect, a mighty lonesome establishment, and I ain’t at all certain I’d care for the company.
