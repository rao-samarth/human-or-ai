I tell you, Phineas, the pamphlets we sent back home describing these paragons of virtue were the most creative bit of fiction since Genesis. They speak of Providence and their sacred mission as if God himself personally handed them the deed to this wilderness, and then they spend their evenings wagering on which of their chickens can outrun a fox. A sacred mission! Why, I saw one of them, a deacon no less, whittling a profane little caricature of the governor into the back of his pew during a sermon on eternal damnation—a sermon he had slept through the first half of, I might add. They possess a peculiar and convenient sort of piety, one that is loud in public prayer and remarkably flexible when it comes to borrowing a neighbor's axe without the formality of asking. They came here to build a shining city on a hill, it's true, but they seem to be spending most of their time arguing over who gets the best view of the tavern from it.
