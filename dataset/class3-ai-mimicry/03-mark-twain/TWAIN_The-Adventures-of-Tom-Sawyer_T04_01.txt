I was endeavoring to enjoy the questionable shade of a mercantile awning when I overheard a piece of local philosophy concerning old Judge Prentiss, a man whose public virtue was so starched and pressed it was a wonder it didn't crack when he bowed his head in prayer. It seems the Judge had foreclosed on the Miller farm with a sorrowful expression and a sermon on fiscal responsibility, all the while knowing he’d bought up the water rights downstream and made the land as worthless as a politician’s promise. Now, the curious part is not the Judge’s scoundrelry—for a man of high station is often just a common rascal with better grammar—but the town’s reaction to it. They whisper about his cunning over checkerboards and fence posts, not with outrage, but with a kind of grudging admiration. A man’s character is what he is; his reputation is what he can get other folks to believe he is, and in a small town, there is a powerful understanding to let the two things run on separate tracks, so long as they don’t cause a public collision on Main Street.
