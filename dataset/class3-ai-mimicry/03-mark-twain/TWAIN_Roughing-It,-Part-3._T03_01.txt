The parson, a man whose Sunday sermons could peel paint off a church door, was endeavoring to teach the Indian boy how to read from a book about righteous living and proper fences. He was sweating clean through his collar, pointing a shaky finger at the letters as if they might bite him, while the boy just sat there, still as a stone in the creek bed, watching a hawk circle high up in the blue. Now, it struck me as a curious notion that a fellow who couldn't tell a poison ivy vine from a green bean stalk was going to civilize a boy who could track a deer through a swamp in the dead of night and find his way home by the stars. The parson’s palaver about eternal damnation seemed a mighty poor substitute for knowing which berries would kill you—a fact the boy had mastered before he could walk proper. A body could get turned around, thinking on it too hard, and start to wonder who was really in need of saving.
