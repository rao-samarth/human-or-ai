The boy waved a hand at the valley, all green and quiet under the afternoon sun, and called our enterprise a crime. A crime! I had to laugh, though it came out more like a cough of dust. "Son," I said, "you're looking at it all wrong. We ain't destroying a thing; we're improving it with the blessings of Progress. It’s a plain and simple Christian duty, as I see it. Why, the good Lord wouldn't have put all this land here and left it so dreadfully empty if He didn't want a sensible man to come along and fill it up with sensible things—like railroads, and land offices, and mortgages. Those fellows already living here, they don't understand the first thing about property or profit, which is the same as not understanding scripture. We're merely teaching them a valuable lesson in modern commerce and piety, and if the lesson requires we take their fields and reroute their rivers for the greater good of our ledgers, well, education has always been a costly business."
