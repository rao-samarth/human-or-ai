The law, as it was written in the heavy book on the desk, was a thing of perfect and terrible neatness; it didn’t account for the shivering of a boy not yet fourteen, nor the way a winter wind can hollow out a stomach. There the boy sat, caught with the stolen bacon right in his sack, and the Sheriff’s office was only a short walk through the mud. A man could follow the straight lines printed on the page, and the whole town would call him righteous for it—a pillar of the community, no less. He’d sleep soundly, knowing he’d done his sworn duty by the county. And yet, the Judge looked from the cold, unblinking words in the book to the boy’s terrified eyes, and saw that the two things did not belong in the same room, nor even on the same planet. The law was a fine and sturdy fence for keeping society in order, he supposed, but it was a blamed poor blanket for a freezing child. He sighed, a great puff of air that seemed to blow all the righteousness right out of him, and shoved the bacon a little closer to the boy’s chair.
