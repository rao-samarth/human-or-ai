Well, they had me pinned up there like a butterfly on a card, every last one of them with a face so long and pious you’d think they was fresh from carving the Ten Commandments themselves. The air in that city chamber was thick enough to bottle, thick with the smell of wet wool and self-satisfaction. And what was my great and calamitous sin? Why, I had admitted—out loud, mind you, which is the chief offense in these matters—that a man is more likely to give a nickel to a beggar when a pretty lady is watching than when he’s alone with his own nagging conscience. You would have thought I’d announced a plan to boil the mayor in oil. The shudder that went through that roomful of respectable scoundrels was a sight to behold; a regular symphony of starched collars and offended sensibilities. Each man, I reckon, was busy calculating just how many of his own charitable acts would evaporate under that particular ray of sunlight, and they condemned me not for lying, but for telling a truth so plain and uncomfortable it soured the cream in their morning coffee.
