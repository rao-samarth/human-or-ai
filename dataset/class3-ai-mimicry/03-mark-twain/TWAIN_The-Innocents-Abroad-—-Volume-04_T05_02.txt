He went on talking, his face lit with a sincerity so pure it was practically a swindle in its own right, and I just sat there nodding like a mechanical doll in a shop window. A man will construct a whole universe inside his head, furnished with the grandest hopes and the most beautiful lies, all because some other fellow gave him the blueprint and swore it was gospel. He’ll take a notion on credit without ever once thinking to check the ledger, happy as a clam to believe in a seven-headed horse if it means the world ain’t as drab and lonesome as it really is. And the bedrock of it all, the foundation upon which he built this whole airy castle, was a story he’d just taken some other soul’s word for—a soul who likely took another’s, and so on back to the first grand rascal who invented the business. You could hand him a bar of solid gold, and he’d declare it a fraud if it didn’t fit with the map of his imaginary kingdom.
