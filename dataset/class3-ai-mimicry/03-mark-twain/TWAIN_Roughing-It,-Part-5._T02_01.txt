To hear these gentlemen carry on in the hotel lobby, you’d suppose they’d done a great and solemn service for civilization itself—a favor to Providence, no less. They caught a man with another fellow’s horse, and so they hanged him from a cottonwood before the sun was high. Well, I reckon it did save the county the considerable bother of a trial, which is a tedious affair full of argument, and it saved a dozen farmers the aggravation of sitting in a jury box when they’d rather be minding their own business. All it cost was one length of good rope and a scoundrel’s soul, which he wasn’t likely using for much good anyhow. The parson himself said a prayer over the proceedings, commending their righteous dispatch. There’s nothing quite so efficient as a mob that’s convinced itself it is the right hand of the Almighty; it gets the dirty work done right quick and feels pious about it into the bargain.
