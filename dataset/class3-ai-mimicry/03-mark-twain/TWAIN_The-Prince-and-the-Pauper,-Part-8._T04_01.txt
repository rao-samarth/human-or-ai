The whole office was walking on eggshells, pretending to be busy but really just watching the show. Then Chester, the new boy whose main duties involved inkwells and dust rags, shuffled forward, looking like he’d rather be anywhere else on God's green earth. He cleared his throat, a sound no louder than a moth’s sneeze, and pointed a dirt-smudged finger at the ledger. “Sir,” he whispered, “that there’s the mark for the Pittsburgh shipment, not the Providence one.” A great silence fell. It does seem a peculiar fact of life that the loudest horn ain’t always on the wagon that’s carrying the goods.
