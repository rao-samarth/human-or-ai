It has always struck me as a peculiar form of human accounting, this business of judging a man’s ledger before he’s even made a single entry. In our own office, I have seen a fellow of impeccable character and a mind as sharp as a newly minted dime be looked upon as if he were a counterfeit coin, all on account of some trivial feature his Creator saw fit to give him. The managers, men of supposed Christian sense and business acumen, will nod sagely and speak of “suitability,” which is a five-dollar word for their own comfortable ignorance. They would sooner trust a known scoundrel who happens to wear the right sort of skin than an honest man who does not; it is a calculation that would bankrupt any sensible enterprise, yet it is the very bedrock on which they build their little kingdoms. They measure a man’s soul with a tailor’s tape, and finding it an unfamiliar size, declare it worthless without a second thought.
