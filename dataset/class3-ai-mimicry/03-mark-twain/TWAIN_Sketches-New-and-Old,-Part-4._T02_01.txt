They tell me you're a scoundrel, sir, a man who could sell a fog bank to a steamboat captain and make him feel he got a bargain. They say your word is a crooked thing, a path that leads a trusting man straight into a swamp, and I reckon they're likely right; the world's got no shortage of cleverness bent on mischief. But I'll tell you a secret that the slickest man never seems to learn—a simple belief, honestly held, is a heap more durable than the most elegant lie ever stitched together. Your fine stories might dazzle a fellow for a spell, and might even get you his last dollar, but they'll fall apart in the first hard rain. My faith in a man's better nature? Well, that's a simple, stubborn thing, and it's a powerful comfort. A fellow might be a fool to hold onto it, but I imagine he sleeps a whole lot sounder than the man who schemed it away from him.
