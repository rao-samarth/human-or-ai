You believe it is a noble calling, a high art? Son, you have been sold a bill of goods. It is nothing of the sort; it is a butcher’s trade, only the meat you are carving is your own soul, laid out raw and quivering on the public slab. You must dredge up every hurt, every shame, every private grief that you thought long buried and flay it open for the gawking spectacle of the mob—and for what? For a pittance that barely covers the ink, while they clap and call you a genius for having bled so prettily upon the page. They will praise your honesty, you see, right before they haggle you down on the price of your own misery. What kind of a man sells his own heart by the pound?
