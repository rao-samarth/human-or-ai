It was a spectacle of profound and magnificent foolishness, repeated on the hour. A motor-car, having assaulted the peace of the lane with its infernal racket, would come to a shuddering halt, and from it would pour a frantic committee of sight-seers. Their mission, it appeared, was not to enjoy the valley but to conquer it; to stare it down with a belligerent intensity for a prescribed number of seconds before it could get the better of them. They would consult their little books, aim their photographic contraptions as if they were weapons, and declare the view “seen”—a fact now duly recorded and ready for report. Then, having satisfied the tyranny of their schedule, they would pile back into the conveyance and depart in a cloud of triumphant dust, leaving the ancient, unbothered hills to the society of the wind and the cows. One might suppose the landscape itself felt a brief, bewildered sense of having been audited, found satisfactory, and summarily dismissed.
