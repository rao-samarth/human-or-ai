You see, a man’s worth in this town isn't measured by the contents of his character, nor the cleverness of his hands—that would be an arrangement far too logical for human beings to contrive. No, a fellow’s station is hitched to a post a hundred years in the past. Take Jedediah Higgins, a man so thoroughly idle he considers breathing a chore; he’s treated like a visiting duke because his great-grandfather once owned a horse that supposedly won a race against a steam-powered thresher. On the strength of this equine myth, Jedediah gets the choicest cut of beef and the most solemn nods from folks who ought to know better. Meanwhile, a decent, hardworking blacksmith, whose only ancestral crime was a grandfather who owned a notoriously slow mule, is looked upon as common as mud. It’s a baffling sort of arithmetic, where the ghost of a fast horse grants a man more credit than a lifetime of honest labor.
