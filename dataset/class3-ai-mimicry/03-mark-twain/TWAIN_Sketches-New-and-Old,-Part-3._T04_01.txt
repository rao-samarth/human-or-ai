There is a peculiar and unshakable faith a town places in a man who arrives by train carrying a leather satchel and a head full of certified opinions. We once had such a fellow visit, an engineer from the city, hired to ascertain the best location for a new town well. He dismissed the spot by the old creek—where the water had run sweet and clear for a century—as geologically unsound, a notion he supported with a great deal of impressive gesturing at a map covered in lines no one else could decipher. Instead, he drove a stake into the center of Miller’s field, a dry and dusty patch of earth if ever there was one, and proclaimed it the only logical site. The town council, swayed by the sheer confidence of his calculations, spent a fortune digging there. They found a great deal of rock, a fair bit of clay, and finally, after much toil, a brackish trickle of water that tasted faintly of disappointment. The old creek, meanwhile, continues its babbling, entirely unconcerned with geological theory.
