It is a curious piece of human machinery, the way a notion can take root in a town and sprout up in every conversation like a stubborn dandelion. For a month, a perpetual gloom had hung over our little settlement, a fog so thick you could hardly find your own opinions in it. Then little Addie Miller, who ain't yet tall enough to trouble a grasshopper, declared that the baker’s new bread had "put a bit of Sunday in her stomach." A fool thing for a child to say, you'd reckon, but the confounded phrase caught fire. First the baker put it on a sign. Then the parson worked it into a sermon about daily blessings, and before long, you'd hear a fellow say his horse was running with a bit of Sunday in his stride. The gloom didn't so much lift as it was crowded out by this cheerful nonsense, proving that a judiciously applied absurdity has more curative power than a whole apothecary of sensible medicine.
