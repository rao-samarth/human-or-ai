There is a peculiar and perpetual itch in the soul of certain men, a vexation that will not let him be—that compels him to pry up a floorboard just to see the joists, or to follow a creek to its altogether uninteresting source. He sees a hill while traveling and is not satisfied with its hill-ness; he must confound himself with the notion of what lies on the other side, even when common sense and the map declare it to be more of the same. It is a species of divine restlessness. And so he upsets the wagon, reroutes the river, and bothers a whole town with his meddling, not from a desire for improvement, mind you, nor from any grand plan hatched in the dead of night, but from a simple, damnable inability to leave well enough alone. The world, it seems, is shifted on its foundations not by satisfied men, but by the ones who just had to know why a thing was so, and if it mightn't be so in some other fashion.
