You must understand my position, for you are the very architect of it. You laid before me a blueprint for a palace, a thing of such shimmering and righteous possibility that a sensible man would feel a fool for doubting it—and I, not always being a sensible man, dove in headfirst. The walls were to be of pure profit, you swore, and the foundations built on a certainty so solid it would make a mountain jealous. Well, sir, I have been living in this palace of yours for a season now, and I find the walls are made of fog and the foundation is nothing but the finest quality mud. Every grand promise has revealed itself to be a well-dressed inconvenience, and the whole confounded enterprise has the distinct aroma of a swindle that has soured in the summer heat. So I ask you, plainly, what is to be done about the mortgage on a castle made of air?
