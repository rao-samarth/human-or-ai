They brought me up here before the whole city council, or whatever assembly of well-fed dignitaries this is, to account for the calamity that did not happen. You see a man who defied all sensible procedure, who ignored the polished brass instructions bolted to the wall, and who introduced his boot to a piece of civic machinery that cost more than all your salaries combined. And you are correct in your facts. But the chasm between your facts and the truth is wide enough to swallow this whole courthouse. Any half-wit can read a manual and pull a lever—it’s a simple business of action and expected reaction. The trouble is, this particular contraption is a liar. It groans one way when it means to shudder, and it whistles a sweet tune just before it aims to explode. It takes a particular and expensive education, an education paid for in sweat and near-misses, to know its mendacious soul and to understand that the only proper answer to its brand of humbug is a well-aimed kick to the third boiler-plate on the left.
