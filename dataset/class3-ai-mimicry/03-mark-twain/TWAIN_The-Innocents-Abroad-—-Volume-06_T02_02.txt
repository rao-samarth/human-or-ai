I confess I entered the grand hall with a certain sourness of disposition, for the whole affair smacked of a high-toned marketplace for miracles. Here were men in their starched collars and ladies in their rustling silks, bidding on polished relics and gilded facsimiles with the same vigor they might apply to a prize hog at the county fair. It was a prodigious and calculated display, designed to separate a man from his wallet in the name of piety. And yet, as the evening wore on, a different truth began to dawn on me. I saw in the earnest faces of the bidders not a desire for mere ownership, but a profound and simple yearning to touch something larger than themselves; to hold in their hands a token, however manufactured, of a story that gave their own small lives a measure of grace. It was a strange and beautiful commerce, where the true currency was not money at all, but faith.
