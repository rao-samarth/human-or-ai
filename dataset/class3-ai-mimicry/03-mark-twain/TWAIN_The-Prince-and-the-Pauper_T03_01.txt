He lowered his newspaper and looked at me over the top of his spectacles, his expression one of a man examining a peculiar beetle. “You feel a twinge for that fellow out there, and you puff up your chest thinking it’s a grand moral accomplishment. Well, it ain’t. That’s just the cheap parlor-room variety of sympathy, the kind that costs you nothing and allows you to go on with your supper. A man who’s never had his own prospects turn to mud, who’s never felt the cold, hard knot of fear in his belly when the rent is due and the larder is bare—well, that man’s heart is a useless ornament. He can look upon another’s ruin and see only a sad story. It’s only when life has handed you your own share of vexation, a proper and thorough thrashing, that you can look at another soul in the mire and not just see his predicament, but feel the infernal dampness of it in your own bones.”
