We got a new clerk in the office last Tuesday, a fella by the name of Abernathy, and you’d think the President himself had come to call, the way the senior partners carry on. He ain’t said more than two words that I’ve heard—and those were just “Good morning”—but he wears a suit so sharp it could cut paper and shoes shined to such a blinding polish a man could check his teeth in 'em. The partners see that suit, and they're persuaded they've hired a genius, a regular captain of industry in the making. They hand him the important ledgers while the rest of us, in our serviceable wool, are still tasked with sharpening pencils. I reckon if a man were to perambulate in here wearing a king's crown, they'd hand him the keys to the company vault on his first day, no questions asked, for the finery itself is the whole of the man's qualifications and character combined.
