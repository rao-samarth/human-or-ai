I was minding my own business over a plate of eggs when I couldn’t help but overhear a gentleman at the next table—a man whose waistcoat was straining to contain a surplus of breakfast and opinions. He was lecturing his poor wife about the magnificent heights we’ve reached, what with our paved streets and our complicated legal documents and our particular insistence on using a different fork for the fish. He declared it the very summit of human endeavor. Well, I looked out the window at a world full of folks scheming to get the better of one another in the most polite and roundabout ways, and it occurred to me that we haven’t improved the man so much as we’ve improved the upholstery on his cage. We’ve simply traded a good, honest club for a sheaf of papers that can knock a fellow down just as flat, and we congratulate ourselves on the refinement of the thing. It’s a brand of tomfoolery so grand it almost commands respect.
