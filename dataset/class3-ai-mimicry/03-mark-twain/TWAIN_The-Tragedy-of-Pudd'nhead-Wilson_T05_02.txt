I will state the facts of the matter, Parson, as I see them, though I expect they will sound a good deal more peculiar in the telling than they did in the living. It commenced, as most troubles in this valley do, with a piece of high-toned foolishness. Silas Croft got it into his head that because his great-grandfather once owned the land the post office now sits upon—a fact of no consequence to any living soul—his own fence line was somehow more dignified than mine. His fence posts were, to hear him tell it, of a finer moral character; his wire held a superior tension. He took to striding past my property with his nose aimed at the heavens, as if sniffing for a foul odor that he suspected had its origins amongst my democratically-grown cabbages. A man can abide a neighbor's pride, I suppose, but when that pride condemns your vegetables and casts aspersions upon your fence posts, well—a point arrives where plain-dealing humanity demands a man make some kind of response.
