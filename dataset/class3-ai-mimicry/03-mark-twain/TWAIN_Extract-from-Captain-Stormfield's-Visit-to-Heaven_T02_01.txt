I must make a clean breast of it, right here in this rattling rail-car. Two gentlemen of supposed considerable intellect have been debating for the better part of an hour the precise moral failings of a politician a thousand miles away, a man neither has ever met nor is likely to. They conduct this grand trial with such heat and thunder you’d think the very rotation of the earth depended upon their verdict. Meanwhile, out the window, a range of mountains that has squatted in silent indifference since before our kind even learned to grunt passes by without so much as a nod. It is a spectacle that forces a man to a terrible and private conclusion: we have mistaken the sound of our own furious jawing for the turning of the celestial spheres, and have built our entire civilization on the notion that the universe is not only listening, but is mighty impressed with the noise.
