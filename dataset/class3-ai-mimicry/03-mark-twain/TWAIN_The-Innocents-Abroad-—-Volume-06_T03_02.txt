I stood for a time on a street corner, watching the human tide flow past in that great, clattering metropolis, and a peculiar notion struck me. Each person scurried along with an air of absolute certainty, a profound conviction in their destination, as if they’d all been handed the same celestial map at breakfast and told not to dally. They did not pause to inspect the architecture or question the names of the avenues; the route was accepted, the goal pre-ordained, and the business of getting there was the only business that mattered. It is a marvelous human talent, this ability to adopt a truth so wholly that it becomes a kind of gravity, pulling you forward without the slightest need for navigational proof. To stop one of these specimens and ask him to account for his hurry would be as fruitful as demanding a storm cloud produce its travel papers—he is merely obeying a higher pressure, and considers that reason enough.
