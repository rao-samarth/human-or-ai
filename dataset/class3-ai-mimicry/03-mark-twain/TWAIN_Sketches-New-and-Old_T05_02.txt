To navigate a city pavement is to engage in a peculiar and maddening form of waltz with a thousand partners, none of whom has heard the music. A gentleman sets his course with the determined air of a ship's captain, only to find his path blocked by a congregation of citizens examining a crack in the stone as if it were a geological wonder. He sidesteps, veering perilously close to a vendor of roasted nuts, and is immediately confronted by a phalanx of youngsters marching abreast, a human wall of such impregnable ignorance that a cannonball might sooner turn aside. You swerve, you duck, you halt so abruptly that your own hat threatens to abandon your head in protest. After ten minutes of this bewildering choreography, you find you have progressed a full dozen yards and have entirely forgotten your original destination—a condition which, I suspect, is the perpetual state of half the city's population.
