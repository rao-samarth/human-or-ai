He laid it all out for me on that rickety table, his voice low and serious, as if he were handing down commandments chiseled on stone instead of flimsy justifications for his own planned rascality. And I expect he even believed himself; a man can talk himself into any brand of righteousness if the reward is handsome enough. He spoke of the sacred rules of commerce, the unshakeable pillars of society—the very same pillars I’ve seen men use as a convenient shield one minute and a club to beat their neighbor with the next. Why, I’ve known more than one Sunday school superintendent who could quote scripture by the yard while simultaneously watering down his stock and short-changing his own mother. It’s a powerful brand of gospel, this public morality, but it has a curious habit of dissolving in the rain the moment a man has to walk home in a storm by himself. It's a fine coat for a sunny parade, but it ain’t worth a damn for actual weather.
