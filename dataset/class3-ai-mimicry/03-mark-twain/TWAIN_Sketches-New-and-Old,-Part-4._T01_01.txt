I set the heavy book down, its pages filled with more rules for living than a man could follow in a dozen lifetimes. A fellow will sit in a high-backed chair a thousand miles away and chart a course for your soul, all without ever having shaken your hand or seen the particular way the dawn breaks over your own windowsill. They’ll tell you the precise angle at which to hold your fork, the exact number of sorrows a heart is built to withstand, and the scientifically-approved method for dreaming a pleasant dream. It is all very impressive and grand, laid out with the certainty of a railroad timetable. But sitting there in the quiet lamplight, it strikes me that the best compass a man has is the one tucked away inside his own chest—it may not always point to the easiest path, but it surely points toward home, and that is a far more hopeful direction than any map printed on paper.
