I had the distinct misfortune of sharing a railway car with two gentlemen whose starched collars were so high I reckoned they couldn't look down to see the mud on their own boots. They were discussing some grand enterprise, a matter of "market consolidation" and "optimizing assets," and it took me a good minute to sort through the five-dollar words to understand the plain English of it. They were plotting, with the serene calmness of men planning a church picnic, to buy up some poor town’s only mill just to shut its doors and sell it off for scrap. They spoke of the families who’d be out of house and home as a "necessary and regrettable expenditure," a bit of unfortunate arithmetic. It struck me then that a common highwayman, who at least has the decency to point a pistol at you while he robs you blind, is a far more civilized creature than a scoundrel who can ruin a thousand lives with a fountain pen and a polite smile.
