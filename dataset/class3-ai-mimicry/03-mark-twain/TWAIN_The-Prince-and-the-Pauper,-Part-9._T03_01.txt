I sat there by the hearth, watching my nephew—a well-meaning boy with a disastrous inclination for speculative ventures—receive a thorough roasting from the assembled aunts concerning his latest financial calamity. Now, in my greener days, I reckon I’d have chimed right in with my own two cents’ worth of wisdom, for there is a certain unholy satisfaction in observing a fool stumble into a pit you’ve already climbed out of yourself. But a man’s own history of blunders and hard tumbles has a way of quieting his tongue; a good, solid drubbing from the world is the only real schooling in the matter of another man’s pain. You can read all the sermons you please and nod piously, but you’ll never truly understand a fellow’s misery until you can recollect the precise chill of having stood in his very same leaky boots, with the cold water of failure seeping right through the sole. It’s a miserable sort of education, I’ll grant you, but it does wonders for curing a man of his own sanctimony.
