From my porch, I can hear the new church bell ringing out across the dusty square, a sound as clean and pious as the administrator’s whitewashed fence. His wife says it rings for the salvation of every soul in this benighted land, a blessed gift from a kinder, wiser world. And all the while, you can hear the steady, rhythmic clang of hammers down by the river, where they are building the new customs house—a mighty fine structure to make certain the land’s other blessings flow in a more profitable, one-way direction. They have brought us sermons on the virtue of meekness, you see, while they tally up our timber and our minerals with a ledger-book righteousness. It is a peculiar sort of enlightenment they are peddling; one where a man’s soul is lifted up to heaven on Sunday, only to find his property has been legislated out from under him by Monday morning. The bell keeps ringing, though, a lonely sound in the quiet heat of the afternoon.
