Mr. Abernathy slid the manifest across the desk, and I near blotted the page for stopping my hand so quick. My quill was already dipped, but there it was, the last line of inventory, and it wasn't cotton bales nor barrels of salted pork. It read, ‘One Girl, named Bess, sound of wind and limb, age about fourteen,’ squeezed right betwixt a crate of iron skillets and three boxes of ladies’ hats. Abernathy, he just tapped his finger on the paper, impatient-like, as if I was dawdling over the price of sugar. I looked at the ink on my pen—a dark, permanent sort of fluid—and it came over me that to write down those words was a worse sin than the selling itself. To make a living soul into a piece of freight with a flick of the wrist, well, it felt like my own hand was forging a shackle. But the man was waiting, and the ink was drying, and what choice did a fifteen-dollar-a-month clerk truly have in the grand and terrible machinery of commerce?
