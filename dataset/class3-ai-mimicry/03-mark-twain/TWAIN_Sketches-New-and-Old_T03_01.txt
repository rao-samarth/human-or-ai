I found myself the other day in one of those grand, echoing train depots, a place so full of hurry and clamor it could make a man's soul ache for the quiet of a graveyard. My simple aim was to discover which track a certain train intended to depart from—a plain fact you might once have gotten from a fellow with a schedule and a lick of sense. But no, progress has seen to that. I was directed to a shining contraption of glass and electricity, a so-called "Informational Automaton," which promised immediate assistance. Well, its assistance was so immediate it offered me a discount on shoe polish, inquired after my satisfaction with municipal plumbing, and displayed a moving picture of a dancing pickle. It would do everything, you see, except the one solitary thing for which it was built. I reckon a truly advanced society is one that has perfected the art of answering every question but the one you are asking. It is a peculiar sort of intelligence, the kind that can calculate the velocity of a distant star but can’t tell you if you’re about to miss your train.
