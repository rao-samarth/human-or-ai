I knew a fellow once, name of Silas Croft, who was as agreeable and plain as a corn-cob pipe before he stumbled backwards into a fortune. The change in him was a lamentable thing, and quicker than a summer storm. He used to be content to argue politics down at the general store, but after the money arrived, he decided his opinions needed to be printed on fine paper and distributed to folks who had no more use for them than a hog has for a holiday. He built a house so grand and gaudy it looked like a steamboat had run aground on a hill, all gingerbread and glass where simple pine would have done just fine. The man developed a new kind of walk, a sort of pompous strut, as if he was afraid the common dirt might leap up and soil his five-dollar boots. It was a peculiar affliction, watching a man get so puffed up with greenbacks that he forgot the simple arithmetic of being a decent human being; he'd traded his good sense for a pile of shiny rocks and seemed to reckon he'd got the better end of the bargain.
