There is a particular kind of madness, I do believe, that seizes a man when he owns a patch of dirt. Take old Silas Grimmett over yonder; he’s spent the better part of this summer erecting a fence fit for a king’s private garden, complete with carved posts and a gate so heavy it groans like a dying sinner. And for what great purpose, you might ask? To contain a single, melancholy-looking mule and three chickens that could fly over the thing if they had a mind to. He sweats and curses from dawn to dusk, all to impress his neighbor, a man who is, at this very moment, likely admiring the superior architecture of a hornet’s nest. It strikes me that the mule has the greater wisdom in the arrangement—he sees a perfectly good fence as nothing more than a convenient scratching post, utterly ignorant of the vast and terrible importance his master has placed upon it. A man will bankrupt his soul for a monument, while a beast is content with a good itch.
