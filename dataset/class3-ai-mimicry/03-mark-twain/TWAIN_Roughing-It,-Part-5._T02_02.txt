Mr. Abernathy discovered the discrepancy in the ledgers around midday, and by a quarter past, young Hemlock was standing before the desk, his face the color of spoiled milk. There was no shouting, you understand, no great moralizing about the sins of theft; Mr. Abernathy was a man of commerce, and he treated the matter as a simple, albeit unfortunate, business liquidation. He explained, in a voice as dry as last year’s corn husks, that the company could not abide the liability of a dishonest clerk, any more than it could a foundered wagon or a lame mule. He then presented Hemlock with a choice: a one-way ticket on the afternoon stage, with only the clothes he was wearing and a solemn promise never to set foot in the territory again, or a more permanent sort of settlement, to be administered by two large men from the loading dock who were currently and very patiently inspecting their knuckles. Hemlock, being a boy with a sensible appreciation for arithmetic, made his decision without any unnecessary delay. The ledger was balanced before the two o’clock whistle ever blew.
