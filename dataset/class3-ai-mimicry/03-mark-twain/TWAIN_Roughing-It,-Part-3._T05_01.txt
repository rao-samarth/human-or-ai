I do believe Mr. Abernathy has worn a permanent groove in the office floorboards with his perpetual pacing, a man so consumed by the grand campaign for Senior Clerk that you’d think he was plotting to unseat a king instead of merely angling for a desk nearer the window. The prize, mind you, is not a kingdom, but the high honor of three extra dollars a week and a view of a most uninspiring brick wall—a view he has likely already committed to memory from his current station, poor devil. He whispers in corners with the gravity of a field marshal, he contrives little plots, he sweats through his collar with the righteous fury of a man defending his very soul from perdition; and all for what? To be the chief insect on a slightly larger leaf. The whole confounded palaver is enough to make a rational man suspect the Almighty had a grand laugh when He first baked this particular vexation into our clay. We are a comical species, indeed.
