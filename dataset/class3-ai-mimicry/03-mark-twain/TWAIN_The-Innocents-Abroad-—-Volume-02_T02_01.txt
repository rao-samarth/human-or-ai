The house was as quiet as a graveyard after the mourners have gone home, and in the flickering candlelight Henderson held up their sacred prize. It was a splinter of wood, no bigger than my thumb, which our hosts swore was a genuine fragment from the very boat that carried the Apostles—a relic for which they had traded a perfectly good horse and half their winter’s hay. Henderson, who could spot a counterfeit dollar from across a muddy river, turned the thing over and over, his face a perfect mask of studious reverence. The old woman watched him from the shadows of the doorway, her hands clasped, her soul fairly shining from her eyes with a faith so powerful it could have moved a mountain of solid evidence. He caught my eye over the flame, and the whole moral predicament was laid bare: he could speak the truth and shatter her world for the sake of cold, hard fact, or he could nod gravely and sanctify a lie that was the cornerstone of her contentment. A faint, devilish smile tugged at his lips, and I knew he was enjoying the choice far too much.
