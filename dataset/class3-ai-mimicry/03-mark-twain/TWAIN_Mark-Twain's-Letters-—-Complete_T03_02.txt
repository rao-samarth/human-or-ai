A man gets to thinking on a long train journey, with the world blurring past the window in a monotonous smudge. People have a notion that this trade is a bolt of lightning from heaven—that a fellow is struck by a grand idea and the words simply arrange themselves on the page as if by magic. What a magnificent piece of humbug. The plain truth of the matter is you hunt down an idea like a dog after a rabbit, and if you’re lucky enough to catch it, you then have the devil’s own time skinning it and making it presentable for the market. You sweat and curse and bleed ink onto the paper, only to have some publisher in a starched collar inform you that your particular brand of truth is not selling well this season. It's a grand swindle, this business of stringing sentences together for pay; you sell pieces of your own mind for coin, and are then told the pieces are the wrong shape.
