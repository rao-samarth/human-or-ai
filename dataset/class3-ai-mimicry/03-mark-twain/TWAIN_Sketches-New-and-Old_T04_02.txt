You seem to believe a man can just let a notion fly out of his mouth like a stray spark from a chimney and not be held accountable for the conflagration that follows. You breathed a little bit of poison into the air—just a phrase, a mere insinuation—and now it's grown legs and a sour disposition. That little whisper of yours has gone and married every fear in this county, and it’s spawning a whole generation of lies, each one more robust and ill-favored than its parent. Now the whole populace is sick with it, a fever of suspicion you cooked up for your own private amusement. You’ve uncorked a terrible humbug, you see, and now you stand there admiring the shape of the empty bottle while the rest of us are left to deal with the stench.
