I watched a man on the riverboat yesterday, a fellow whose face was a sour ledger of Wall Street anxieties, and he paid no more mind to the glorious bluffs sliding by than a hog pays to astronomy. He was a creature consumed by the arithmetic of acquisition, a walking multiplication problem whose only answer was *more*. It is the strangest of human ambitions, it seems to me—this frantic scrabbling for shiny metals and printed paper. A man will trade his peace of mind, the respect of his fellows, and the simple, honest pleasure of a sunset for a hill of coins he cannot possibly spend in one lifetime. He barters away his soul piece by piece, believing each transaction makes him richer, when in fact he is only purchasing a more expensive and elaborate coffin to be miserable in. In the end, he owns a great many things, but the whole enterprise has come to own him, and that is a bargain from which no man ever profits.
