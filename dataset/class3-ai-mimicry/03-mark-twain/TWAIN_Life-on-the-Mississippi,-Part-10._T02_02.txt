The Honorable Augustus Finch was holding court near the punch bowl, his voice a foghorn in a teacup, explaining to a circle of mesmerized ladies how the new cantilever bridge was a miracle of modern ignorance. He gestured with a half-eaten canapé, proclaiming the entire structure was balanced on a single, precarious pin—a bit of flapdoodle he’d likely invented on the spot. A quiet man, a Mr. Cobb who had the look of a fellow more familiar with mud than marble, cleared his throat. "Begging your pardon, sir," he said, his voice no louder than a rustle of paper, "but the load is distributed across a series of trusses and anchor piers." A silence fell that was heavier than the bridge itself. Finch puffed up like a threatened toad. "And what, sir, would give you leave to contradict me on such a matter?" Mr. Cobb looked at his own hands, which were calloused and plain. "I reckon because," he said, without a trace of malice or pride, "I'm the man who drove the last rivet."
