Well, here I was, planted on a street corner where the whole of humanity seemed bent on running a man down, and I had an appointment of some consequence with a fellow whose face, I reckon, was so pinched from counting other people’s money it looked like a dried apple. The arrangement was for two o’clock, and my watch told me I was already offending the man’s ledger by a good five minutes. Every soul on that pavement scurried along with a look of terrible importance, as if the fate of nations depended on them getting to the next block a little quicker. And then I saw it: a little puddle of grimy rainwater in the gutter, catching the sun just so. It struck me then that a man could get a powerful lot more truth out of studying the swirl of dust in that puddle than he ever could from a banker’s lecture on thrift; a powerful lot more. The notion took hold, a troublesome and glorious notion, that I ought to shuck off my boots right there and cool my feet in it, and let all the respectable business of the world go straight to Jericho.
