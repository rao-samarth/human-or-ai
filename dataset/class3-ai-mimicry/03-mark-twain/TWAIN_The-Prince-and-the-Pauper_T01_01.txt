You take a man, son, and you wrap him in the finest broadcloth the mill can produce, you polish his boots until they reflect the very gates of heaven, and you set a stiff, unimpeachable hat upon his head; and what have you got? Why, you’ve got a pillar of the community, a man whose opinion on politics and the price of corn is suddenly worth a king’s ransom. But let that same man appear with a bit of honest dirt on his trousers or a fray at his collar, and all that supposed sagacity vanishes like a sinner’s prayer in a hurricane. His soul could be as pure as a spring morning, but the public jury, mind you, has already convicted him of vagrancy based on the evidence of a single busted button. It’s a queer sort of judgment, where the tailor holds the gavel and a man’s character is measured by the yard.
