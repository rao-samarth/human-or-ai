The clock had just struck two when a clatter from the kitchen—a sound like a full set of crockery declaring its independence—jolted me from my chair. And there he was: a wretched little field mouse, a fleck of dust with a heartbeat, regarding me with the insolent calm of a railroad baron who has just foreclosed on a widow's farm. I snatched up the hearth-broom and gave chase, a righteous crusade against the furry marauder. We thundered through the downstairs, a hurricane of man and mouse; I, a Vesuvius of righteous fury, and he, a scurrying little Nero fiddling while my domestic Rome burned. A lamp went over with a soul-shattering crash, a stack of ledgers scattered like frightened quail, but I pressed on, for it had become a matter of principle, you see. The entire moral architecture of the household, and perhaps the planet itself, rested upon my ability to corner this thieving little beast and reassert the natural order of things.
