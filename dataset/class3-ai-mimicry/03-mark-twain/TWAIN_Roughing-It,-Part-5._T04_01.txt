The town council, when it met, liked to concern itself with matters of high principle and civic beautification, which is a fine and noble thing for a body of men to do. There was a two-hour argument, I recollect, about the proper Grecian style for a drinking fountain that had not yet been funded, paid for, or even located on a map. Mr. Abernathy gave a stirring speech on the lasting importance of public aesthetics, a speech that was roundly applauded by men who afterwards would step outside into a street that was little more than a river of mud and refuse when it rained, and a plain of dust and argument when it did not. They would debate the moral character of the republic for a whole evening, and then go home to houses where the well water was known to give a man the summer complaint. It does seem that the further a problem is from a man’s own boots, the more he enjoys the ceremony of solving it.
