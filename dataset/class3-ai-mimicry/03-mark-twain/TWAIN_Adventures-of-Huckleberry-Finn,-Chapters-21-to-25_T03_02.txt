You put on a right fine show up there, a regular spectacle of sorrow that would make an undertaker blush for his own lack of feeling. He clutched his breast as if my words were a physical blow, and a tear—a genuine, well-rehearsed tear, I’ll grant you—welled up in the corner of his eye, catching the lamplight just so. Don’t you try that on me. A man who sells patent medicine from a wagon at least has the decency to look like a scoundrel; he doesn’t poison the well of human kindness by pretending to weep into it. You, sir, are a different and more contemptible brand of humbug altogether, for you practice your trade not on a man’s wallet, but on his very soul, and I reckon that’s a piece of villainy the devil himself would hesitate to claim as his own invention.
