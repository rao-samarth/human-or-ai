I watched him put on his little show for the head clerk, and a finer piece of theater you never did see, not even for a two-bit admission. He’d sigh, a great heaving affair like a blacksmith’s bellows with a puncture in it, and run a trembling hand through his hair as if the sheer weight of his fabricated troubles was about to snap his neck clean in two. He’d point to a perfectly ordinary ledger and speak of its terrible complexities, his voice cracking with a sorrow so counterfeit it would make an undertaker blush. And the head clerk, a good man who believed in the sweat of the brow, he’d buy the whole sorry spectacle—clapping the scoundrel on the back and promising him relief. It was a rank betrayal, not just of the truth, but of the very notion of honest toil, and to witness such a good-hearted man so thoroughly hoodwinked by a cheap, gaudy pantomime—well, it was a brand of heartache that settles deep in a man’s soul and refuses to leave.
