Well, sir, you asked me to account for the whole sorry business, and I reckon the long and short of it is you can’t teach a man to value a clock when he’s got the sun, the moon, and a perfectly good stomach to tell him all he needs to know. We came freighted with salvation and starched collars, convinced we were pulling them from the mire, but they just looked at our stiff-necked piety and our timetables as a peculiar sort of madness. We gave them a book of rules as thick as a brick, and they used the pages for kindling. Not out of malice, you understand; it’s just that a warm fire on a cold night is a more present and persuasive truth than a thousand commandments concerning property you can’t fence and a heaven you can’t see. We called their ways savage, and they called ours… well, they didn’t call it anything. They just smiled, a patient and perplexing sort of smile that made a man feel like the prize fool in a world full of them.
