I reckon there is no higher art, and no more delicate a science, than the construction of a truly magnificent falsehood. I’ve been watching the man opposite me for the last hundred miles—a portly gentleman in dry goods—as he explains to the wide-eyed youth beside him how he once chased a jackrabbit clean across three counties on the back of a particularly ambitious turtle. The boy, of course, believes him. And why shouldn’t he? The story is delivered not with a wink and a nudge, but with the solemn, world-weary gravity of a preacher recounting a miracle. A poor liar trips on the details and sweats like a sinner on Judgment Day; but a master, you see, builds his palace of absurdity on a foundation of such plain, unvarnished sincerity that you’d feel like a scoundrel for even thinking to doubt him. It’s a performance, a gift, and a man who can do it well is an artist of the first rank, though his canvas is nothing but air and a fool's credulity.
