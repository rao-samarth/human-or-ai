My Uncle Jedidiah sat there by the fire, belly full of roast goose and righteousness, explaining to us youngsters how a man’s character is forged in honest toil—a mighty peculiar sentiment coming from a man who hadn’t lifted anything heavier than a mint julep in twenty years. He’d puff out his chest and talk about Providence and the natural order of things, and all the while his own soul was growing as soft and useless as his hands. It always seemed a strange sort of bargain to me; you trade away your own backbone for the privilege of owning another man’s, and then you call the transaction a blessing. Why, he could preach a sermon on humility that would make a saint weep, then turn right around and bellow for his houseboy because his slippers weren’t perfectly aligned with the hearth. There ain’t no poison that sours a man’s spirit quicker, I reckon, than the notion that he is lord and master over another man’s breath. It just hollows him out and leaves a well-dressed shell of a scoundrel.
