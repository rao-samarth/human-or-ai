The argument between Bledsoe, the undertaker, and Mr. Finney, the blacksmith, had reached what you might call a professional impasse. It concerned a shared wall, and which man’s noise had a greater right to pass through it—the mournful hammering of coffin-lids or the cheerful clang of horseshoes. They’d decided on pistols at dawn, which seemed the only sensible solution for gentlemen of their standing. However, the whole affair was delayed nigh on three hours; first, because Finney had to shoe Judge Abernathy’s mare, which had thrown a shoe on its way to the courthouse, and second, because Bledsoe was called away to measure the late Silas Croft, who had perished from a sudden disagreement over the quality of saloon whiskey. The two combatants merely tipped their hats to each other as they went about their separate duties, intending to resume their fatal quarrel as soon as commerce and catastrophe permitted. It was a town that understood priorities.
