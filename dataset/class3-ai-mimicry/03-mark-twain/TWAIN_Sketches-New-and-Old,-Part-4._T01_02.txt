I watched the endless river of faces flow past my bench, and it struck me what a lonesome business it is to be a man. You get yourself a fellow in a fine coat who has studied the science of it all—the getting of money, the keeping of health, the navigation of one’s own heart—and he will sell you a map. It’s a handsome map, full of straight lines and promises, drawn up with the kind of certainty that only a man who has never been lost can possess. So you take his map, and you fold up the crumpled, dog-eared one you’d been making yourself, and you walk his clean road. You walk it right into a swamp he forgot to mention. And there you sit, in the center of a million other travelers, each clutching his own pristine, store-bought map, all of you wondering how it is you can be so perfectly, scientifically, and expertly marooned.
