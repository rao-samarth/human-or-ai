A man gets so accustomed to his own brand of trouble he forgets there’s a whole world out there operating on a different schedule entirely—one that ain’t concerned with profit or loss. I sat on my porch this morning and watched the sun come up over the eastern ridge, and it was a sight to cure a man of his own importance. It didn't make a grand announcement; it just sort of leaked over the horizon, a slow-spreading stain of pale gold that set fire to the underside of a few lazy clouds. Then that light came spilling down into the valley, touching every blade of grass and making the whole damp meadow steam and shimmer as if it were waking from a fine dream. A fellow could watch a thing like that and feel as if the whole magnificent show was put on just for him, and that for a little while, at least, everything was bound to be all right.
