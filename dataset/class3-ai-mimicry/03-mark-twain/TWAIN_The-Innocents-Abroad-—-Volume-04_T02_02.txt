The Colonel, a man whose piety was as starched and formidable as his collar, cornered me by the potted ferns to recount the origins of his ancestral faith. He spoke of a founding prophet who, with nothing but a hickory stick and a stern word, commanded a mountain to move three inches to the left to improve the morning view from his hovel. “A true marvel of divine engineering!” the Colonel boomed, sloshing his brandy. I allowed that it was, indeed, a considerable feat of geology. Privately, though, I couldn’t help but wonder if the fellow hadn’t just misremembered where he’d been standing the day before. It has always struck me that the Almighty, for all His cosmic spectacle, seems to have a peculiar fondness for small, unverifiable adjustments that are later written down in very large books by men who weren’t there to see it. It saves on the expense of witnesses, I suppose.
