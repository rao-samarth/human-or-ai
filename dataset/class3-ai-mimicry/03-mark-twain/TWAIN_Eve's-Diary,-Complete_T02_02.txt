Heavens no, child, it ain’t a lightning strike like the poets claim. For the longest time, she was just… there. A reliable fact, you might say, like the sun coming up or the creek flooding in April. We’d pass an entire evening on this porch, her shelling peas and me whittling some fool thing, and the silence between us was more comfortable than any conversation I ever had. Then one day she let out a laugh—not a polite titter, mind you, but a genuine, shoulder-shaking peel—at some nonsense a bluejay was up to, and the sound of it knocked me sideways. It was in that moment I understood, with a clarity that was mighty inconvenient, that her particular brand of silence and that singular laugh had become the very posts and beams holding my whole rickety life upright. A man don't get used to a thing like that; he just gets ambushed by the sudden truth of it.
