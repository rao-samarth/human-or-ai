The crickets have a more sensible religion than most men I know. They sing their earnest, monotonous song to the moon without expecting a reply, and when the frost comes they meet their end with a dignified silence. Man, on the other hand, builds a grand celestial architect in his own image—jealous, and vain, and forever keeping a ledger of slights and supplications. He imagines a Providence that watches a sparrow fall, yet somehow overlooks the most monstrous cruelties man invents for his own kind. It is a tiresome business, this notion of a grand plan that so closely resembles a small man's fretful bookkeeping. Out here, under the vast, unblinking indifference of the stars, it all seems like such a paltry and lonesome invention, cooked up to keep the dark at bay for one more night.
