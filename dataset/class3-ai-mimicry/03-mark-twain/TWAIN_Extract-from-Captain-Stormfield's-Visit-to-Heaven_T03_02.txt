The house has gone as silent as a sinner at a sermon, and it’s in this quiet that a man’s thoughts get to rattling around. All day I’ve had to listen to the town gush over Colonel Hemphill’s latest investment—a magnificent scheme to sell ice to folks in the tropics, or some such foolery. They speak his name as if it were solid gold, a thing to be admired and weighed, simply because he makes a thunderous noise about his own prospects. Well, I’ve seen a summer storm make a prodigious racket, too, and leave behind nothing but washed-out gullies and rattled nerves. I’d trade a dozen loud-mouthed colonels for one quiet farmer like my neighbor, a man who knows the character of the soil and can raise a crop from plain dirt and sweat—a genuine act of creation that don’t require a brass band to announce its arrival. The world applauds the lightning bug for its brief and showy glint, but it’s the sun that does the real work, and it asks for no applause at all.
