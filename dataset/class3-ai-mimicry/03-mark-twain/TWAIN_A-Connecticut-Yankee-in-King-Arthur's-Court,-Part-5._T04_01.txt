We had a perfectly serviceable system for sorting the accounts, which involved a single, honest metal spike upon which a man could spear a bill and then forget it, knowing its soul was safe and its location certain. But then the proprietor's nephew returned from some Eastern college—one of those places where they teach a boy how to complicate a sunrise—and he declared our spike an affront to the modern age. Now we have a contraption of varnished cabinets and a whole rainbow of little paper flags, all governed by a book of rules thicker than a sinner's conscience. It requires three men where one used to do; one to find the cabinet, one to consult the rules, and a third, I suppose, to faint from the intellectual strain. The accounts are perpetually lost, of course, but the nephew calls it ‘systematized optimization,’ which I reckon is just a ten-dollar way of saying you’ve found a more expensive and laborious way to fail.
