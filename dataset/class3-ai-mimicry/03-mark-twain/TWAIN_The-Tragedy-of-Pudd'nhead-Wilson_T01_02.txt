The whole house is as quiet as a church mouse in winter, and there’s the boy, sleeping in his little cot with a look of pure and simple peace. A body could get to thinking about how a person comes to be. Some folks will tell you he’s got this-or-that in his blood—a measure of his grandpa’s stubbornness or his uncle’s mischief, as if he were a jug already filled and corked right at the start. But that ain’t the whole truth of it, not by a long shot. The jug is mostly empty, I’d say, and the world, and the people who love him, get to pour in the good stuff. We fill it with kindness, with laughter, with the notion that a man ought to be fair even when it’s hard. The shape of his heart ain’t stamped on him from the get-go; it’s carved, day by day, by the gentle hands that raise him up. Why, with the right sort of tending, a soul can learn to grow as straight and true as an oak, and that’s a mighty comforting thought on a long night.
