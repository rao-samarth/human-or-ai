From my perch on this rattling train car, I watched a well-meaning fellow from back home attempt to instruct a local farmer on the proper, civilized method for peeling a piece of fruit. The farmer, a man whose ancestors had likely been peeling fruit since before our man’s own country had a name, listened with a kind of profound, patient bewilderment. It is a curious affliction of mankind—this notion that one’s own particular set of habits is not merely a product of chance and geography, but a divine blueprint for all sensible persons to follow. He was as certain of his knife-and-fork technique as a preacher is of perdition, and just as eager to save a soul from the barbarism of using one’s own thumbs. I do believe if you gave that man a map of the world, he would not see nations and oceans, but only a vast, untidy territory in desperate need of his personal correction.
