Old Silas Butterfield, having newly retired to a quiet patch of land where the loudest noise was the evening chorus of frogs, soon found this very chorus to be an offense to his civilized ears. He declared it a disorganized and vulgar squawking, entirely lacking in proper musical structure. And so, with the kind of confidence only a man who has never consulted a frog about its own business can possess, he set about to correct them. Every twilight he would march to the edge of his pond with a silver flute and play a prim and orderly little tune, a melody he was certain would elevate their primitive croaking. The frogs, for their part, would fall silent for a moment—not in rapt attention, you understand, but in the cautious way of a creature assessing a new and peculiar disturbance—before resuming their ancient, bog-born symphony with a vigor that seemed almost defiant. It was a nightly contest between one man's inflexible notion of harmony and a whole pond's worth of inherited truth, and the pond always won.
