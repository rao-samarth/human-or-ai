A man finds there is a particular quiet that takes up residence in his soul once the shovels have been put away; it is not a peaceful quiet, mind you, but a hollow, buzzing sort, like a hornet’s nest you daren’t disturb for fear of what might fly out. The sun carries on, brazenly warming the very porch swing where the conversation stopped, and the river don't seem to mind that it now rolls on past a different sort of landscape. You spend your days listening for a footstep that has lost its sound, a habit as stubborn and useless as trying to teach a cat geometry. And in all that listening, you discover the heaviest burdens ain’t the ones you carry, but the empty spaces you can no longer fill. The whole affair is a lonesome education in the arithmetic of subtraction, a lesson nobody asks for and everybody gets.
