Well, I’ll grant you it does look a frightful swindle on its face; a whole week’s wages gone for a man to poke his finger at a pipe for two seconds and declare it sound. Any halfwit could poke a pipe, you say, and you ain’t wrong. But the difference, you see, is that this particular fellow, with his dusty coat and eyes that have seen the secret insides of a thousand houses, he spent thirty years learning which pipes to poke and, more importantly, which ones to leave entirely alone. A man like me, I’d have taken a wrench to it with all the misplaced confidence of a rooster at sunrise, and we’d be swimming in our own parlor by now. He wasn’t paid for the poke—heavens, no. He was paid for the thirty years of calamitous floods in other people's homes that taught him precisely *where* to apply that poke. There’s a certain genius in knowing what not to do, and it’s a commodity that always fetches a dear price.
