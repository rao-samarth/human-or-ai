Well, the afternoon was snoozing along peaceful as a church mouse, with the chickens taking their dust-baths in the road and not a thing stirring but the heat-devils. Then it came. First a clattering and a popping that sounded like a whole regiment of tinware falling down a mountainside, and then the thing itself—a sputtering, smoke-belching devil-wagon—came tearing 'round the bend. It didn't so much travel as it did explode its way forward, a monstrous mechanical insect in a hurry to get nowhere in particular. The chickens squawked and shot up in a feather-storm that looked like a pillow-fight in a whirlwind, and old man Hemlock's prize mare, who hadn't been startled by anything more than a bumblebee in twenty years, decided she'd rather be in the next county and took half the picket fence with her. The lunatic driving the contraption just grinned, proud as a boy with a new slingshot, never minding that his grand invention had just un-invented a perfectly good and quiet piece of the day.
