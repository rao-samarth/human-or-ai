The gentleman who peddled his meteorological certainties had already collected his dollars and was now a mere puff of dust on the horizon, leaving half the respectable men of our town clutching their new acquisitions with a solemnity generally reserved for prayer books. Each man possessed a polished hickory rod, from which dangled a single, sanctified strand of what the salesman called “Himalayan Yak Hair”—though it looked suspiciously like it came from the hindquarters of Miller’s old gray mare. They squinted at the cloudless sky, then at the limp hair, consulting it as if it were a direct dispatch from the Almighty concerning the prospects of a dry spell or a gully-washer. They debated its subtle twitches with the gravity of theologians, each one dead certain he’d purchased an infallible truth. It never ceases to be a marvel, the astonishing price a man will pay for a fiction he wishes to believe in, especially when the plain and honest truth is lying right there on the ground for free.
