There is a particular species of calamity reserved for a peaceful country morning; it arrives not with thunder or cannonade but with a profound and baffling quantity of smoke. Our chimney, having evidently decided to renounce its God-given vocation, began to belch forth a greasy, yellow fog that suggested the devil himself was curing hams in our flue. My wife, a woman for whom a broken teacup signals the end of days, commenced a series of shrieks that might have panicked a herd of buffalo, while our neighbor rushed over with a garden rake—a tool of questionable utility in firefighting, I must say. We heaved buckets of well-water with a frantic energy that would have shamed a professional brigade, drenching the hearth, the rug, and a sleeping cat, only to discover the source of this suffocating pestilence. It was no grand conflagration, but a miserable, smoldering nest of damp twigs and foolish ambition; a monument to a sparrow's poor judgment. We had waged a titanic war against a puff of vapor, and the house was left in a sorer state from our salvation than it ever was from the peril.
