I watched young Abernathy from my office door, his brow furrowed with the kind of profound concentration a man usually reserves for either prayer or cheating at cards. He was wrestling with that new automatic ledger machine, certain he’d found a clever little shortcut to bypass the entire fifth column of figures—the very same shortcut that sent his predecessor, poor Finch, packing for the territories with nary a nickel to his name. The machinery changes, the names on the door change, but the particular brand of earnest, high-minded foolishness that convinces a man he can outsmart simple arithmetic; well, that seems to be a permanent affliction of the species. You could set your watch by it. Give a man a new invention, and he will spend a solid week devising a new and more complicated way to hit himself in the thumb with it, and have the gall to call it progress besides.
