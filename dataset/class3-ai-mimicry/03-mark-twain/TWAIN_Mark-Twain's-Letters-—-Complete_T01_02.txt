My employer, Mr. Abernathy, paced the floorboards of his cramped office, a veritable cage for a mind of his considerable dimensions. The man was a genius, you see—a pure, unadulterated visionary—and the constant thumping on the door from bill collectors was merely the sound of lesser men failing to comprehend the scale of his latest enterprise. "It's the patent," he'd whisper, more to the dust motes than to me, "the patent for the self-buttering toast-rack! It will revolutionize the breakfast table, my boy, and render us kings." I believed him, of course. A man who could speak with such fire about a simple kitchen utensil was not to be doubted, and the mounting pile of unpaid invoices on my desk was, I assured myself, merely the kindling for the great bonfire of our eventual, spectacular success. The wolf at the door, I reckoned, had simply mistaken our burgeoning palace for a common pigsty.
