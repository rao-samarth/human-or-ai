Henderson leaned against the window, which rattled in its cheap aluminum frame as if in protest of the view, and let out a sigh that would curdle milk. "I tell you, it's a crime against nature," he grumbled, pointing not at the majestic skeleton of the old amphitheater below—a place where, I am told, gladiators once fought for their very souls and ten thousand spectators roared in a single voice—but at the sputtering coffee pot on the filing cabinet. "That contraption cost the company twelve dollars, and I reckon we got swindled." I considered the mighty arches yonder, the very stones whispering of forgotten triumphs and empire-shattering tragedies, and then I considered our water-stained ceiling tiles and the faint, persistent smell of burnt wiring. "Well, Henderson," I said, "somebody has to pay for all that history, and it appears our budget for decent coffee was the first casualty."
