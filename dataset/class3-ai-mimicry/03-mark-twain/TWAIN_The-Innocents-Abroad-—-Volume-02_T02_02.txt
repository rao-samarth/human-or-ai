The whole square was a regular human beehive, swarming with pious souls so desperate for a miracle they’d likely buy a ticket to the moon if you told them Saint Peter kept a summer cottage there. And right in the thick of it was a scoundrel—a genuine artist in his line of work—selling splinters from the very ladder Jacob dreamed on. Or so he claimed. They were just bits of a broken crate, you could see the shipping marks if you weren't blinded by devotion, but Lord, how the people clamored for them! They shoved and elbowed, a righteous stampede of believers, flinging their hard-earned coin at the man as if it were cursed. One old woman, with a face like a dried apple, wept with joy as she clutched a piece of kindling that had cost her a week’s wages. I do believe if that rascal had held up a dead cat and called it a relic of the Ark, the whole crowd would have fought to the death for the privilege of buying its tail.
