I have always held that a man with a clear destination is a king among men, but this city’s thoroughfares are designed to dethrone him at every step. One sets out with a brisk and purposeful stride, only to be immediately confronted by a human glacier—a family of six spread wide as a battle line, inspecting a window display of inconsequential trinkets with the gravity of astronomers discovering a new star. You swerve to the left, and you are met by a fellow ambling along as if his legs were rented for the day and he was not yet certain of their operation. A swerve to the right brings you face-to-face with a lady who has chosen that exact square foot of pavement, out of all the acres available, to halt dead and wrestle with the contents of her handbag. It is a conspiracy, I tell you; a grand and silent plot by Providence itself to ensure that no honest man ever arrives anywhere on time, or with his sanity fully intact.
