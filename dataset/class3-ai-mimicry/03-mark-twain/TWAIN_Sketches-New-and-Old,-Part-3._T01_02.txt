I found myself jammed in that great human river flowing down the city’s gullet, a place where the clamor of iron-shod wheels and the ceaseless shouting conspire to murder silence for good and all. And there I saw a thing which ought to have soured the milk of human kindness in the breast of a saint. A gentleman, polished and puffed like a prize pigeon, dropped his wallet, and a ragged boy—all sharp elbows and hungry eyes—darted out to retrieve it for him. For this singular act of Sunday-school virtue, the boy was rewarded with a stout grip on his collar and a bellow of “Thief!” that drew the whole witless, gawking mob. They closed in, a circle of righteous fury, ready to see a child damned for an act of decency. It struck me then that all the copybook maxims and fireside sermons in the world are but a flimsy paper shield against the first spark of suspicion in a fearful heart; they are pretty tunes whistled in a hurricane, utterly lost in the howling.
