So you reckon you've finally got the measure of the trade, do you? I can see it in your eyes—that same shine I once had, a peculiar gleam that says you've learned every trick and turn of the tools and now the world owes you a comfortable living. Well, I'm obliged to inform you that you’ve only learned how to properly sharpen the axe, not where to swing it, nor how to account for the astonishing number of ways a tree can fall wrong. The real education, the one that grinds a man's spirit down to a fine dust, starts the day you're the one left to explain why the tree fell on the customer's prize hog. You stop being the fellow who saws the wood and become the fellow who has to answer for the sawdust, and I tell you, there's a whole universe of misery in sawdust that no apprentice ever dreams of.
