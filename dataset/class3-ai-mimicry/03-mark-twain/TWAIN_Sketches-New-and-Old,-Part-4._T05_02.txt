There is no human endeavor more calculated to breed mutiny and despair than the seemingly simple act of assembling a family for a photograph. My brother-in-law, a man who fancies himself an engineer because he once fixed a doorbell, took charge of the affair with the gravity of a general deploying troops for a final, desperate charge. He arranged us and re-arranged us, shifting aunts and cousins about the divan like chess pieces in a losing game. The children, of course, understood this as a prime opportunity for wiggling, face-pulling, and investigating the structural integrity of the floor with their knees. With every click of the infernal machine, someone had either blinked, sneezed, or developed a sudden, overpowering scowl. I came to see that the whole calamitous performance—the frantic commands, the stifled groans, the pure, boiling indignation over a crooked collar—was a far more honest portrait of our relations than any placid, smiling image could ever hope to be.
