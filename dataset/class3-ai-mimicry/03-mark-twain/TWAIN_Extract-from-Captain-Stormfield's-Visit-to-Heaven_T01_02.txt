The last log settled in the hearth, a soft collapse of ash and ember that seemed to punctuate the awful silence of the house. I had been wrestling all evening with the preacher’s Sunday palaver—that whole intricate business of a grand and merciful plan. Merciful! It strikes me as the blueprint for an infernal machine, designed by a celestial artisan with a peculiar fondness for watching his own creations squirm. He endows a man with a thousand howling appetites and passions, then furnishes him with a single, paltry conscience to keep them all in check—and for the inevitable failure, he promises a furnace. It is a scheme so monstrously one-sided it would make a riverboat gambler blush with shame. To be told you are cherished by the very architect of your own private scaffold; it is a loneliness so profound it freezes the heart, and you are left to wonder what kind of tyrant demands adoration for his cruelty.
