I found myself at one of those family conclaves where the air is thick with opinions and roast beef, watching my cousin Bartholomew hold court. Now, Bartholomew is a man whose exterior suggests he was chiseled from granite by a committee of bankers—all stern jaw, iron-gray hair, and a suit of clothes that likely cost more than the horse that pulled my carriage. He spoke of ledgers and liabilities with the gravity of a preacher announcing the final judgment. But then a stray dog, a scruffy little beast of no account, wandered in and laid its head upon his expensive shoe. The banker vanished. In his place was just a fellow, a plain man whose hand knew the particular comfort of scratching behind a dog’s ear. It is a curious thing, this human animal; we spend a lifetime cultivating a shell, polishing it and showing it off, only to have the true creature within peek out for the love of a flea-bitten mongrel.
