There is a particular and glorious brand of freedom to be had by leaning half your body out of a speeding coach window, a freedom that involves the wind thrashing your hair into a bird’s nest and the distinct possibility of collecting a face-full of bumblebees. But just as I was achieving this noble state, a hand like a cold slab of bacon clamped down on my britches and hauled me back inside. It was the parson, of course, a man who believed the Good Lord had laid out the world’s roads not for adventure, but merely as a straight and terribly dull line to next Sunday’s sermon. He lectured me soundly on the perils of what he called 'reckless abandon,' which I reckoned was just a grown-up’s term for anything that was actually fun. The man’s face was a map of disapproval, and I saw then that the whole enterprise of becoming an adult was mostly about learning to sit still and finding ever more reasons to say 'don’t,' a sorry business if ever there was one.
