I found myself waiting on a depot bench, watching the dust motes dance in the afternoon sun, when I caught the low murmur of two old gentlemen beside me. One of them, a man whose suit had seen better decades, leaned on his cane and said to his companion, “They paint you a picture of a grand celestial city, full of gold paving and ceaseless hallelujahs, as if a man wants to spend all of forever with his ears ringing. I suspect the real prize is a good deal quieter. Just a porch, maybe, with a tolerable breeze and a long, unbroken silence. Not happiness, you understand; for happiness is a noisy and troublesome affair that wears a body out. No, just the end of bother. The final, blessed ceasing of all expectation, where you can at last put your feet up and not have to account for yourself to any soul whatsoever, be he above or below.”
