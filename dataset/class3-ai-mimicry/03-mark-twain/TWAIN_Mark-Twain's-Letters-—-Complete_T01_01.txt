I sat staring out the grimy window of that infernal rail-car, the whole of the country blurring into a monotonous brown smear, and found myself engaged in a familiar and altogether cheerless bit of arithmetic. Every clatter of the wheels upon the track was a fresh debt added to the ledger, and every mournful cry of the engine’s whistle seemed a lament for some new and spectacular commercial failure. The grand scheme—the one meant to finally hoist me from the muck and mire of pecuniary desperation—had burst like a soap bubble, leaving behind not a rainbow of prosperity but the same old greasy residue of ruin. It is a damnable sort of prison, this constant scrambling for capital; it turns a man’s waking hours into a fever-dream of figures and his sleep into a parade of phantom creditors, each one with a face more disappointed than the last. A fellow might as well try to bottle the wind as to secure a fortune when his luck has run sour.
