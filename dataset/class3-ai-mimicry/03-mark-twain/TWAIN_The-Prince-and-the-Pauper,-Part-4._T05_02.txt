My brother, having lately been appointed foreman at the lumber mill, took it upon himself to organize the family for a photograph, and in that moment I saw the whole miserable pageant of command. He stood on the porch steps, clapping his hands like a man trying to startle a flock of pigeons, each clap producing less effect than the last. He sought to arrange us by height and disposition, a task akin to sorting thunderbolts in a shoebox. For Aunt Polly refused to stand anywhere but in the shade of the elm; the children were engaged in a holy war over a grasshopper; and Uncle Silas, who hears what he pleases, believed my brother was announcing a fire. To be the man at the top is to be the loneliest soul at the party, the one man denied the simple pleasure of misbehaving because he is too busy trying to manufacture a spectacle of order for a world that has no use for it. He wore the crown of that small moment, and it looked to me heavier than any anvil.
