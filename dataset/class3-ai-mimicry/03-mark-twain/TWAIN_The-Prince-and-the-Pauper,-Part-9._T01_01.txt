I was sitting on a bench near the courthouse, minding my own business and the sun, when they brought the old fella out. He wasn't much of a criminal to look at; mostly just tired bones and a bewildered sort of shame in his eyes, the kind you see on a dog that's been kicked for no reason it can comprehend. Two stout men in uniform had him by the arms, though I reckon a strong gust of wind could’ve done the same job and with more gentility. A woman in the small crowd—his daughter, maybe—wasn't wailing or carrying on, just standing there with her face all empty and white, like a porcelain plate somebody’d dropped. And I thought to myself, there is a peculiar and terrible sort of order to the whole business; a grand, unfeeling engine that will grind a man to dust for misplacing a single nickel, and call the whole affair ‘propriety.’ It cares naught for the soul of the man, you see, only for the impeccable neatness of its ledgers.
