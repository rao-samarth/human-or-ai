You ask after our neighbor, Mr. Abernathy, and I reckon he is as he ever was—which is to say, about as industrious as a sleeping hound on a hot day. He spends the bulk of his hours now upon his veranda, fanning away the gnats and complaining of the sun, a Herculean labor which he feels entitles him to a sermon's worth of grumbling come suppertime. The peculiar business of having every want and whim catered to has, it seems, drained the very marrow from his ambition, leaving him a creature of pure appetite and pronouncement. He will lecture a body for an hour on the sacred virtues of honest toil, all while one of his people mends a fence under that same blistering sun, and he sees no more contradiction in it than a rooster sees in its own crowing. It is a queer sort of rot that sets in; it don't just bind the hands of one man, it appears to paralyze the soul of the other, puffing him up with so much idle importance that you begin to fear a stiff breeze might carry him off entirely.
