Sleep was a regular humbug, a promise sold to a man at the end of a long day only to be snatched back by the thievery of a racing mind. I paced the floorboards—the squeak of the third plank near the stove serving as a dismal sort of metronome for my anxieties—and considered the whole shabby enterprise. A leak in the roof, a debt to a man who smiled too much when he collected; these were my own particular gnats buzzing at my ear. But then my thoughts went wider, a plague spreading house to house down the dark street. There was old widow Hemlock with her cough, and the Cooper boy with no boots for the winter, and a dozen others besides, all of them tangled in the same infernal net, thrashing about with a kind of frantic hope that only made the knots tighter. It seemed the whole human race was born with its pockets turned inside out, scrambling for a dropped penny in the mud while the celestial bookkeepers tallied up the profits. A grand joke, if you could find the heart to laugh at it.
