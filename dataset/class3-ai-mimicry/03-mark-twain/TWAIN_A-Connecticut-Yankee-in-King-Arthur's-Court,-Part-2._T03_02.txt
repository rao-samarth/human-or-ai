I was watching old Fitzwilliam try to introduce his prize mule to the virtues of a brand-new, double-bladed plow sent down from a factory in the city. That mule, a creature of such profound and monumental stubbornness it would make a glacier seem hasty, had planted its feet with the kind of finality usually reserved for gravestones. Fitzwilliam, he cajoled and he threatened; he whispered sweet promises into one long ear and swore oaths that would blister paint into the other. He might as well have been trying to persuade a stump to enter a footrace. The shiny red contraption was, by all accounts, a marvel of engineering meant to save a man’s back and shorten his day, but you cannot explain the geometry of a better future to an animal that has already made up its mind. No, sir. A body has to get the hankering for a new road on its own; you can show it the map, you can describe the fine inns along the way, but you’ll only get a sore arm and a powerful thirst from trying to drag it there.
