The man on the stage went on sawing the air with his hands, his voice a perpetual drone about industry and the bright, beckoning future—a future I felt I had already traded away for the privilege of sitting here. They handed me a rolled-up paper, a receipt for a great and terrible transaction of the soul, and I took it without much feeling at all. A body spends years burning the midnight oil, cramming his head with the certified wisdom of the ages, only to find he has learned just one thing of consequence: the true and bottomless depth of his own ignorance. The applause sounded a great way off, like rain on a tin roof in another county. All that struggle, all that ink and ambition, had purchased not a grand enlightenment, but only a more profound and educated species of loneliness; and for that, it seemed, I was now expected to be grateful.
