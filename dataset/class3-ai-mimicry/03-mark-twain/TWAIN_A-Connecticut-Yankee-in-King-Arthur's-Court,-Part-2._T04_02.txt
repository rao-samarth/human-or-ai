I found myself under the considerable weight of my Aunt Elspeth’s gaze, a stare so profoundly disappointed it could have soured milk from across the county. I had merely suggested, in what I reckoned was a moment of idle historical speculation, that our sainted grandfather—a man who by all family accounts personally chiseled the Ten Commandments—might have had a passing acquaintance with a whiskey bottle and a losing hand of cards. A silence fell over that parlor so thick you could have sliced it up for winter preserves. Cousin Jebediah stopped polishing his spectacles; the dog, sensing a shift in the moral atmosphere, slunk under the settee. It wasn’t the facts of the matter that caused such a commotion, you understand; facts are flimsy things, easily batted away when they prove inconvenient. No, I had committed a far graver offense: I had tried to pry a stone loose from the foundation of their certainty, and they looked upon me with the righteous fury of a people whose church had just been declared a tavern.
