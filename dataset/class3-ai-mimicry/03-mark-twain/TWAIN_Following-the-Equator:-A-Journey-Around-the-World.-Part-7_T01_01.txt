My Dear Williamson, regarding our new administrative office in the southern territories, you must make it perfectly clear to the local foremen that our presence is a work of benevolence—a heavy and pious duty we have taken upon ourselves. We are not there simply to turn a handsome profit from their abundant natural assets, though Providence has indeed smiled upon our balance sheets. No, sir, our mission is to lift these simple people from the darkness of their own contentment and introduce them to the manifold blessings of progress: namely, the six-day work week, the moral clarity of a payroll deduction, and the soul-ennobling terror of a deadline. They have languished for generations, you see, in a deplorable state of owning the land they live on, and it is our solemn obligation to relieve them of that burden. So when you issue the new contracts, you will explain that the clause assigning all mineral rights to the company in perpetuity is for their own protection. We are philanthropists, Williamson, and it is a hard and thankless business.
