Here I am again, setting the type for another miracle cure—this one a patent liniment said to mend a broken bone just as quick as it soothes a common toothache, a claim so grand it would make a corpse sit up and laugh. It’s a sad business, but profitable. A stranger with a shiny waistcoat and a knack for solemn pronouncements can roll into this town and sell the folks anything from a perpetual motion machine to a ticket to the moon, and they’ll empty their pockets with the earnest gratitude of souls being saved from perdition itself. It ain’t that they lack sense entirely; no, it’s that their world is so small and plain that any promise painted in loud enough colors looks like a masterpiece of divine intervention. They mistake a well-practiced lie for a revelation, every single time, and call a man a cynic for suggesting the paint might wash off in the first rain.
