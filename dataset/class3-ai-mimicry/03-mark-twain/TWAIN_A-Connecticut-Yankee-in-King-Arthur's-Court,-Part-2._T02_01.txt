Well, the whole town had got a case of the fantods, and it was a sight to behold. Some fool claimed to have seen a bad sign in the clouds—looked more like a tired pig to me, but that didn't stop the panic—and before you could spit, every citizen was scurrying about like ants on a hot skillet. And who was there to lead the charge against this invisible devilment? Why, it was the mayor and his council of well-fed hangers-on, of course. They stood on the courthouse steps, their chins held high as if they were smelling something holy instead of their own hypocrisy, preaching about omens and civic duty. They riled up the crowd into a proper lather, all while making sure the new 'emergency tax' was announced loud and clear, a blessed little remedy for whatever phantom was plaguing us. A body could see plain as day they weren't saving us from spooks; they were just shaking our pockets empty while we were all looking at the sky.
