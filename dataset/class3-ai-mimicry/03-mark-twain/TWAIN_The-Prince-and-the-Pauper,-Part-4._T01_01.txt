We had a fellow on the eastbound train, a gentleman of such ponderous dignity and with a waistcoat so puffed out with self-importance that you’d have wagered the nation’s entire financial stability was buttoned up inside it. He sat stiff as a plank, surveying the rest of us humble passengers as if we were a collection of particularly uninteresting insects he’d unfortunately been sealed in a jar with. For the better part of a day, he was a silent monument to prosperity, only moving to consult a gold watch that looked heavy enough to anchor a small skiff. But then a stray cat—a scrawny, flea-bitten thing that had stowed away in the baggage car—darted out and took a sudden fancy to his polished boot. Well, sir, the shriek that gentleman let out could have curdled milk in the next county over. He scrambled atop his seat with the agility of a spooked squirrel, all his high-and-mighty composure having evaporated like dew in a furnace, proving that a fine suit is little more than a fancy costume for the same fearful creature that resides in us all.
