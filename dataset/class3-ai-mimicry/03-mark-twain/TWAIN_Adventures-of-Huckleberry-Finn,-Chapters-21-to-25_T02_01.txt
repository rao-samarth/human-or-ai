I will not stand here and tell you I was a stranger to that street corner, no sir. When a thousand throats are hollering the same righteous notion into the smoky air, a man finds he has a surprising amount of iron in his spine—borrowed iron, I now suspect, on which he pays a heavy interest later. You take any one of us aside, away from the general palaver, and ask him to explain the particular logic of the enterprise, and you’d find a stammering fool who couldn’t persuade a housefly to quit his sugar bowl. But you weld a hundred such fools together with a good, loud slogan, and you forge a creature that feels like Judgment itself, marching on cobblestones. It’s a peculiar sort of bravery, you see; the kind that requires a thousand other backs to press against your own before you dare to even raise your voice. A single man is just a whisper; the trouble begins when he mistakes the roar of the crowd for his own.
