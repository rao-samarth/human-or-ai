I suspect my host, Mr. Abernathy, hasn’t enjoyed a proper night’s rest since his first railroad investment paid out—a man with a fortune the size of a county seldom does. He prowls that cavernous house after midnight, all polished wood and velvet curtains thick enough to smother a preacher’s sermon, his bare feet making not a whisper of a sound on the imported carpets. Sometimes the flicker of his lone lamp down the hall is the only thing moving in the whole funereal place. He’ll be in his study, a room grander than a governor’s office, running a bony finger down ledgers not for pleasure but for fear; checking to see that his numbers haven’t somehow evaporated between dusk and dawn. He has barricaded himself behind a fortress of gold, only to discover he is not its warden, but its most pitiable prisoner, rattling the bars of his own gilded cage.
