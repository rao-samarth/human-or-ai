My sole objective upon entering that clamorous emporium was to secure a simple biscuit, a feat I presumed a man of sound mind and limb could accomplish without a collegiate education. I was mistaken. A boy with the frantic energy of a hornet trapped in a jar snatched the last one from under my very nose, leaving me to navigate a labyrinth of barrels and crates in pursuit of another. An elderly woman, whose bonnet supported enough artificial flora to reforest a small state, then blocked my path to debate the moral character of a particular brand of molasses with a clerk who looked to be on the verge of weeping. I sidestepped, pivoted, and nearly collided with a pyramid of tinned peaches, which wobbled with a profound and threatening gravity. Behind me, some fool declared loudly to another, “Such efficiency! The very model of modern commerce!” I finally located a barrel, only to find it contained not biscuits, but a universe of desiccated beans. It is a peculiar feature of civilization that it so often conspires to place the maximum possible number of obstacles between a man and his lunch.
