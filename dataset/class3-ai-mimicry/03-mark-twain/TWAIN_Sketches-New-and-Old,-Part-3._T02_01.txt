Now, you ask for an accounting of the events, and I am obliged to furnish one, though it defies the sanest logic. The calamity, you see, began not with a bang, but with a button—a single, pearlescent button from my wife’s traveling coat, which chose this precise moment in our journey to liberate itself and roll under the heaviest trunk in the compartment. Its recovery necessitated a grand and perilous shifting of baggage, a task which upset a precariously balanced jar of marmalade. This, in turn, cascaded onto a valise containing my finest white shirts, creating a sticky, orange morass that attracted the immediate and undivided attention of a hornet that had been, until then, a peaceful passenger. My subsequent attempts to dispatch the beast with a rolled-up newspaper resulted in the shattering of the window, through which the offending button, the hornet, and my dignity made their final, swift exit. So you see, sir, I did not set out to cause a riot; I was merely trying to retrieve a button.
