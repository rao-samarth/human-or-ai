It commenced, as most grand calamities do, with a trifle. Mr. Abernathy, a man whose ambitions far outstripped his natural grace, had intended only to make a favorable impression upon the mayor’s formidable wife. A single, errant drop of claret upon his starched collar was the first shot fired by a hostile universe. His attempt at a discreet remedy—a frantic dabbing with a napkin—produced a result more akin to a bull attempting needlepoint; he succeeded only in upsetting a candelabrum, which in turn set a small mountain of imported hydrangeas to smoldering with a most un-Christian fury. One might have supposed that Providence, having made its point, would relent; but Providence, it seemed, was in a particularly inventive mood. His desperate lunge for the punch bowl, a vessel filled with a liquid more flammable than pious, served only to baptize the inferno, transforming a polite little fire into a roaring declaration of his complete and utter ruin. The grand finale saw him trip over a poodle of negligible size and land squarely in the five-tiered wedding cake, emerging as a frosted monument to the folly of all human endeavor.
