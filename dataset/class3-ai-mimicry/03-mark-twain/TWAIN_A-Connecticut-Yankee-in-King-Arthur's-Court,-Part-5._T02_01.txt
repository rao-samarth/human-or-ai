Don’t you dare wave that family tree at me, son! You think because some buckskinned ruffian two hundred years ago had the good fortune to steal a bigger patch of land than his neighbor, that some particular magic got into his bloodline? That his great-grandson—a boy who hasn’t had an original thought since the day he learned to walk and whose chief accomplishment is buttoning his own coat—somehow inherited the grit and gumption of that original scoundrel? Why, it’s the most preposterous notion ever cooked up by a man too lazy to earn his own supper. A man’s virtue isn't a deed you can hand down to your children; it’s a thing he forges himself, in the heat and the dirt, every single day. The rest of it is just a grand and glorious humbug, dressed up in silk and sold to fools who are too proud to admit they’ve been cheated.
