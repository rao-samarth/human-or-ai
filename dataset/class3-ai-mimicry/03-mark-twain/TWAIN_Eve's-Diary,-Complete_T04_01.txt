A man perfectly content with the world as he finds it is a peaceable creature, to be sure, but about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. He will watch the sun rise and set and never bother his head about the machinery of it all. It’s the other sort of fellow, the one with a perpetual itch in his mind, who causes all the commotion and—as a general rule—all the advancement. He’s the kind of man who can’t see a river without wondering if it mightn’t be persuaded to run uphill, just for the novelty of the thing. He will dismantle a perfectly good timepiece just to satisfy a sudden wonder about its ticker; and while he may vex his wife and confound his neighbors, he is liable to end up with a new sort of gear that revolutionizes the town clock. The world is pushed along, you see, not by the folks who are content to ride in the wagon, but by the ones who can’t stop tinkering with the wheels.
