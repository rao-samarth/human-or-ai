I took up a post on a dry crate to watch the city’s grand parade of self-importance, a spectacle you could enjoy for free any afternoon if you had the stomach for it. Here came a banker and his wife, him starched so stiff you’d think a sudden sneeze might shatter his collarbone, and her sailing along behind a nose pointed so high at the heavens she was in constant peril of tripping over a loose cobblestone or a sleeping dog. They navigated the scrum of humanity—the shouting fishwives, the grimy urchins, the general miasma of coal smoke and horse—with a practiced blindness, a genuine talent for pretending none of it was there. And then a drayman, a bull of a fellow with no more poetry in him than a sack of potatoes, spat a brown stream of tobacco juice that landed not a foot from her pristine, white-gloved shoe. She didn’t flinch, not an inch; but I saw the muscles in her jaw tighten, and I knew right then that all our parlor manners and Sunday sermons are just a flimsy dam holding back a mighty inconvenient river of pure, unadulterated aggravation.
