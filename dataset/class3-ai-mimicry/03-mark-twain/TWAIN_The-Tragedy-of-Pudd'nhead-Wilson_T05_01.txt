I watched my aunt preen on account of her husband being a town alderman, a position of such earth-shaking consequence it mainly required debating the proper angle for a new horse trough. She’d cast a pitying glance at Cousin Jeb, who does nothing more noble than coax life out of the dirt. But Jeb’s boy, a little rascal barely five years tall, he couldn’t tell a politician from a pumpkin farmer. He saw only two things: a man with a shiny watch fit for inspection, and another man who could conjure a carrot from the earth like a genuine magician. The boy, he just grabbed both their hands and hauled them off to admire a bullfrog, and for a blessed minute, the alderman and the farmer were just two grand fellows under the command of a barefoot tyrant. A spectacle like that is enough to give a man some faith that all this fuss about who’s better than who will wash out in the next good rain.
