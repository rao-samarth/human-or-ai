I laid the new business proposal before the committee, and a curious division of minds immediately became apparent. Mr. Henderson and his fellows saw the matter as a piece of machinery; they concerned themselves only with the primary gears and levers, the direct line of profit from our door to the customer’s purse. So long as the main axle turned, they were satisfied. A problem to them was a busted cog, to be replaced with a bigger, stronger one—a simple, brute-force solution that ignored the rattling it might cause elsewhere. But Miss Albright and her colleagues, they saw the whole enterprise as a living creature. They fretted over the secondary effects; how a change in one department might starve another, how a new policy would affect the general mood, and what quiet resentments might curdle if one team was favored over another. One group saw the skeleton, you might say, while the other saw the entire nervous system, and I was left to ponder how the two could ever be persuaded they were looking at the same animal.
