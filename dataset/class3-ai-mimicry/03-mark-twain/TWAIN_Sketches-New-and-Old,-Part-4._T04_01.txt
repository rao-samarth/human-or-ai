I was once trapped at a dinner so respectable it would make an angel fidget, and the subject of absolute honesty came up for review. A certain Judge—a man whose face was a permanent advertisement for his own importance—held the floor, sawing the air with a fork to punctuate his sermon. He declared that a single, solitary lie, no matter how small or well-intentioned, was a crack in the very foundation of a man’s soul; he spoke of truth as a thing so pure and holy that even to gaze upon a falsehood would stain a person’s character for all eternity. It was a fine speech, full of thunder and righteousness. No sooner had the applause died down than the hostess, a kindly woman with nerves like fiddle-strings, asked if he was enjoying his soup. The Judge, who had just a moment before been discreetly picking a rather large fly out of it, beamed at her and pronounced it the very nectar of the gods—an act of charity, I suppose, that proved his soul was not made of such brittle stuff after all.
