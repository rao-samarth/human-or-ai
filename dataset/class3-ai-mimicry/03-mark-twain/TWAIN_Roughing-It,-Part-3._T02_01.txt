Mr. Gable, a man whose earnestness was never in question, presented his summary of the shipping incident with the solemn air of a judge delivering a verdict. Every particular in his report was verifiable—the time of departure, the weight of the cargo, the names of the crew, all of it as solid as granite. Yet the finished account, in its totality, was a more magnificent piece of invention than anything you could buy for a nickel at the bookstall. It was a peculiar sort of falsehood, constructed entirely from unassailable facts, much like a masterfully built clock that, despite its perfect gears and springs, is designed to tell you it is noon at midnight. He hadn't so much written a lie as he had carefully arranged a set of truths into a formation that could only march the reader to a false conclusion. It's a curious thing, that a man can build such a sturdy vessel out of honest timber, only to steer it straight for a phantom shore.
