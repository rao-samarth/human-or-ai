It’s a peculiar kind of quiet that settles on a house after midnight, a silence that seems to magnify a man’s thoughts until they’re as loud as a town crier. I was just reading about the new commission for public morals—a grand and righteous palaver if ever there was one—and it set me to wondering. Here we are, a people so concerned with the specks of sawdust in our neighbor’s eye that we’ve built a whole industry around pointing them out, all while conveniently ignoring the lumberyard in our own. We’ll preach temperance with a whiskey on our breath and decry the gambler’s vice on our way to speculate on the price of corn. A man will thunder from his high office about charity on Sunday, and on Monday he’ll foreclose on a widow for a pittance she can’t possibly pay. It is a fine and noble arrangement, you see; it keeps a body so busy polishing his own halo that he’s got no time left for simple decency.
