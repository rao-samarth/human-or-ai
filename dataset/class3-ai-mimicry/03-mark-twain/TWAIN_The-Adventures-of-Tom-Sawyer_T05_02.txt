I fancied myself a knight of old, you understand, only my battlefield was the governor’s damask-draped dinner table and my lance was a sharp tongue. That windbag, Filbert, had made some slight against Miss Penelope's canary, and I saw my chance for a heroic defense. I prepared a retort so cunning, so exquisitely barbed, it would have made a porcupine blush with envy. I stood, cleared my throat, and opened my mouth to deliver this verbal thunderbolt—just as a waiter, hurrying with a wobbly tray of blancmange, tripped over the Mayor’s outstretched foot. The world dissolved into a pale, quivering avalanche. My grand oration was cut short by a face-full of gelatinous goo, and Filbert, the object of my intended scorn, was howling with a laughter that shook the very chandeliers. A fellow can plan for a battle of wits and a glorious victory in a lady’s eyes, but he can seldom account for the calamitous intervention of a poorly-balanced dessert.
