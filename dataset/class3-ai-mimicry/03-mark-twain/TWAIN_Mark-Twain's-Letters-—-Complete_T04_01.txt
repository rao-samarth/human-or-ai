You would not believe the commotion I witnessed down in the public square today, a regular circus of human conviction. Some politician—one of those fellows with a jaw that moves faster than his conscience—was promising the working man a future so bright it would require smoked glass just to look upon it. The crowd, a great heaving sea of hopeful and perpetually flummoxed faces, swallowed every last syllable; they cheered his grand pronouncements on liberty as if liberty were a hot meal you could carry home in a sack. I tell you, a man who can sell an empty bottle for the price of a full one has found his proper and most profitable calling in public office. The whole affair is the grandest sort of humbug, and the best part is, everyone pays an admission fee to the spectacle and calls it patriotism.
