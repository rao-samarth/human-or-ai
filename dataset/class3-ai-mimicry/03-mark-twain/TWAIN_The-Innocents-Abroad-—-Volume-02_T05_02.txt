Mr. Abernathy slapped my manuscript down upon his desk with a force that rattled the inkwell and sent a shiver clear through his prodigious jowls. “Confound it, sir, what is the meaning of this libel?” he sputtered, his face the color of a poorly boiled ham. “The Grand European Sojourn is our most lucrative advertiser; they expect an account of edifying vistas and soul-stirring history, not a three-page dissertation on the indigestion caused by their ‘authentic regional sausages’ or your claim that the natives looked upon our motor-coach with the same enthusiasm a farmer reserves for a plague of locusts! We sell the glorious sensation of having *been* somewhere, without the tedious and often flea-bitten business of actually *going*. You have provided them the unvarnished, inconvenient truth, which has no more place in a holiday prospectus than a sermon has in a saloon.” He paused for breath, expecting a vigorous defense, but I found I had none to give; a man who willingly pays to be herded like prize cattle from one ruin to the next has already forfeited his right to complain about the quality of the feed.
