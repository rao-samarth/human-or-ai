It’s a curious thing to look out upon a town when it’s deep in the arms of midnight, for the darkness is a great equalizer of vanities. From my window, the grand stone edifice of the bank president looks no more important than the ferryman’s humble clapboard shack down by the water; they are both just lumpy shadows dreaming under the same moon. I reckon the man in the silk nightclothes and the fellow on the straw-stuffed mattress are chasing the same sort of phantoms in their sleep—a fat fish on the line, or perhaps a kind word from a pretty girl. All those fences we build in the daylight, all the starched collars and shiny boots that holler one man’s better than another, they just melt away into the quiet dark. It gives a body a powerful hope, it does; a hope that maybe a sliver of that sensible, moonlit truth will survive the sunrise, and we’ll remember we’re all just folks trying to find a patch of comfort under the same wide sky.
