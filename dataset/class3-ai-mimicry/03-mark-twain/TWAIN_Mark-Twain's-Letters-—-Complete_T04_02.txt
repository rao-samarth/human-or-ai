I was observing a column of ants the other morning out by the old well—a more industrious and single-minded procession than you’ll find in any state legislature—and it struck me that we have the whole business backwards. They march for a crumb, and we march for what we call Progress, and I’ve yet to see a principle that fills a man’s belly half so well as a good crumb. A man will spend his life bellowing about Liberty and the Common Good, which are notions as substantial as a fog on a winter morning, all while another fellow is picking his pocket. He’ll then form a committee to investigate the theft, which hires another committee to oversee the first, and pretty soon the whole county is employed in the grand business of discovering who stole the horse long after the barn itself has burned to ash. It is a peculiar form of madness, to be sure, but a mighty profitable one for the rascals who sell the buckets.
