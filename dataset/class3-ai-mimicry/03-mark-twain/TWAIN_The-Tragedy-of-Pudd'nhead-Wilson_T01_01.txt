I reckon a man puts too much stock in where a body comes from, as if good breeding in a horse is the same article as in a human. I once knew a family—or knew *of* them, which is safer—that had a boy born with a pedigree as long as a winter's night, while down the hollow a half-dozen barefooted children tumbled out of a shack with no more ancestry than a field mouse. Now, if you was to take that high-born child and raise him in the shack on corn pone and cuss words, and put the little ragged one in the big house with a tutor and a prayer book, why, you’d see a curious thing. In twenty years, the fancy boy would be fit for nothing but whittling and spitting, having learned the trade from his masters, whilst the shack-born fellow would be lecturing the town on civic duty. It goes to show that what’s poured into a person’s head is a heap more consequential than the jug it was born in.
