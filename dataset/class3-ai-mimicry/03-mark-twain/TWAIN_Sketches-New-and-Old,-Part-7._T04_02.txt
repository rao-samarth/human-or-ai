It was a simple enough ambition for a Tuesday—to persuade a stubborn fence post back into the vertical persuasion from which it had lately departed. But the post, having found a comfortable lean, resisted with the full moral authority of inanimate objects. When Mr. Gable put his shoulder to it for one final, mighty heave, the rotten wood did not straighten but rather snapped clean off, sending him staggering backwards into Mrs. Higgins’s prize-winning rose bushes. The thorns, being entirely impartial in their work, tore his Sunday trousers and provoked a yelp of such profound indignation that it startled a flock of pigeons roosting on the courthouse roof. They exploded into the air, a feathered confederacy of panic, and flew directly into the path of the mayor’s horse, which promptly bolted, overturned a cart of cabbages, and left the town’s chief dignitary sitting in a heap of ruinous coleslaw, contemplating the mysterious and unforgiving architecture of consequence.
