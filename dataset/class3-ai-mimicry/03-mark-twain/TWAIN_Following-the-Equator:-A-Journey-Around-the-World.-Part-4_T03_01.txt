The sun was bleeding out over the western hills, painting the whole sorry business of the world in a prettier color than it deserved, and I got to thinking on a particular kind of human foolishness. It’s a stubborn sort of blindness. You see a man, a good man with a soul as decent as any you'd find in a prayer book, and yet folks will judge him wanting on account of the Creator's choice of paint for his hide. They'll measure the worth of his heart by a standard he had no hand in choosing, no more than he chose the air he breathes. It's a mighty curious and sorrowful way for a person to be, to look at a fellow creature and see only the shell, declaring the kernel inside rotten without ever a-bothering to crack it open. And that judgment, once passed, settles in hard and deep, like winter mud, and no amount of reason or decency can ever seem to wash it clean.
