My uncle, a man whose opinions were as loud and unyielding as a steam-whistle, was holding court at the head of the dinner table, booming on about the Age of Improvement. We were, he declared, a people of unmatched refinement, leaving the savages to their mud-huts and their superstitions—a grand pronouncement that was immediately punctuated by my cousin Billy catapulting a buttered pea straight into Aunt Martha’s towering hairdo. A gasp went around the table, a proper little tempest in a teacup. Martha’s husband, a fellow who looked perpetually wronged by the universe, began a low muttering about discipline and breeding, while Billy’s mother shot back a glare that could peel paint. And through it all the uncle forged ahead, praising our dignified society, our lofty reason, never noticing the little war that had broken out over his plate of roast beef. It seemed to me we hadn’t climbed so high as he imagined, but had merely built a fancier roost for the same old squawking chickens.
