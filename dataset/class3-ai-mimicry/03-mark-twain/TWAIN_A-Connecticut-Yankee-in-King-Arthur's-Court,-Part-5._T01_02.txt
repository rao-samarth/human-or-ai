I was sat in the Bixby Junction depot, listening to the telegraph key clatter away in the next room like a nervous squirrel chattering its teeth—a sound that promised great progress and mostly delivered great headaches. Two fellas near the cold stove were jawing, and the younger one, a drummer by the look of his shiny boots, let out a laugh. The old man had just been telling how his pa could quiet a storm-spooked horse with just a whisper and a certain kind of knot tied in its mane. A foolishness, the drummer called it, pure country foolishness. Why, he said, with the iron horse and the talking wire, a man had no need for such backward notions. He had a point, I reckon, a hard and shiny point with no give to it. But it seemed to me that a world that traded a quiet horse-whisper for the shriek of a steam-whistle hadn't made as fine a bargain as it thought. It had swapped a small, private miracle for a loud, public convenience, and the silence left behind felt a whole sight emptier.
