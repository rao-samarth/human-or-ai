I surveyed the great hall, where gentlemen of formidable reputation and ladies of considerable expense paraded about in silks and jewels. A body could get the notion, watching them, that they were a different species of animal altogether, manufactured in some heavenly workshop and sent down here to show the rest of us how it’s done. But I took a good long look, past the starched collars and the practiced smiles, and I couldn’t help but reckon that all this finery was just a sort of expensive paint slathered over the same ordinary timber. The General, for all his medals that glittered like a hundred suns, was likely fretting over an ill-fitting boot; and the Judge, whose pronouncements could alter the course of a man’s life, was probably just a fellow with a nagging toothache and a powerful wish to be home by his own fire. Take away the uniform and the gavel, and you find the same fretting, hoping, troublesome creature you'd find anywhere else—only this one has learned to hide it behind a better grade of wool.
