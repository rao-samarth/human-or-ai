I recollect the time our town council, in a sudden spasm of what they called civic improvement, hired a man clear from the city to advise us on the proper construction of a pigsty. This gentleman arrived with a leather satchel full of diagrams and a head so full of scientific notions you could hear them rattling when he walked. He lectured us for two hours on ventilation theories, drainage gradients, and the psychological effects of lumber selection on the swine, making our simple method of just nailing boards together seem a downright criminal enterprise. We all nodded along, too impressed by his five-dollar words to question them. So, we built his palace of a pigsty according to every last specification, a structure that cost more than my first house. The pigs, however, being uneducated in modern science, showed a clear and immediate preference for the muddy wallow just outside the gate, leaving the scientific marvel to be admired only by the flies.
