I was trying to enjoy a perfectly good bit of shade on a park bench when a feller nearby commenced to instruct his boy on the grand doings of the past. It was a righteous and noble affair, it seems, this particular ancient business—every last detail accounted for, every hero pure of motive, and the whole concoction tidied up neat as a Sunday sermon. It is a powerful curiosity to me, how a man can know the secret thoughts of another man who has been dust for two thousand years; he speaks of it with more certainty than I possess about what I ate for breakfast this morning. I have a notion that the official record of a thing is mostly just the most convenient story that survived the journey, a tale polished by generations of well-meaning men who couldn't bear the thought that their celebrated ancestors were just as quarrelsome, vain, and generally confused as we are. A good, solid, comfortable falsehood will always travel further and faster than the plain, lumpy truth.
