The whole town was in a grand conniption over the new livery pump, which, after a week of heroic service, had decided to give up the ghost entirely. A regular congress of loafers and self-appointed engineers had gathered, each man loaded to the brim with a theory more fantastical than the last. "It's the iron in the water," declared one, poking the handle with a stick. "Clogs the very constitution of the thing!" Another blamed the summer heat for warping the leather, and a third swore it was the ground shifting. They argued and spat for a solid hour, accomplishing nothing but the raising of dust, until old Silas, the blacksmith, finally ambled over from his forge. He gave the pump a single, contemptuous kick, wiped sweat from his brow, and grunted, "The main pin's sheared. A two-cent piece of steel." And just like that, the debate evaporated. A man who has hammered metal for fifty years doesn't need to shout; his certainty is a heavier thing than all the collected wind in the county.
