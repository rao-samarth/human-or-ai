I must confess, and you may take it down as testimony against my character, that I have never been able to properly cultivate that brand of conviction which thrives best in the dark. On our journey eastward, I observed a man who could absorb a doctrine the way a dry sponge absorbs ditchwater—he asked no questions about the water's purity, only praised its glorious wetness. He found a profound comfort, a kind of holy slumber, in accepting that which had no more foundation than a fog bank. You could have told him the ship was powered by the fervent prayers of the righteous, and he would have nodded sagely and perhaps even added a prayer of his own to hurry us along. But my own mind, I am sorry to say, is a pestering and disagreeable thing; it insists on asking to see the boiler and check the coal supply. This unfortunate constitution has cost me a great deal of comfort, but it has saved me an even greater deal of tomfoolery.
