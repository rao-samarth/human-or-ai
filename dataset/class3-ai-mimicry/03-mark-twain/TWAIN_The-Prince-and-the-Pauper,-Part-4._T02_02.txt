Well now, I see you’ve all got your judging-day faces on, ready to read the riot act to little Timmy over there, who looks about as cheerful as a frog on a hot skillet. Before we pronounce sentence and haul him off to the gallows of his bed-chamber, it might pay to inquire into the *why* of the thing. A boy doesn't just up and shatter his auntie's prize china pitcher for the pure sport of it; there’s always a reason coiled up behind the mischief, like a spring in a clock. It seems the little rascal saw a thirsty honeybee drowning in the cream and, in his noble effort to perform a rescue, he performed a demolition instead. Now, I ask you, is that a crime deserving of fire and brimstone? The lawbook might say the pitcher is broken and a price must be paid, sure enough. But a human heart—a thing with more sense than any dusty lawbook ever printed—it looks at the boy’s earnest face, understands the kindness that went sideways, and finds a better way. It finds a way to mend more than just the crockery.
