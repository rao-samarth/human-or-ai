The General, a man whose polished buttons seemed to have a brighter future than his eyes, was holding forth at the dinner table about the sacred genius of our nation’s founders; you would think from his telling that they were a species of angel who descended on a cloud of constitutional parchment. He painted them as tireless, pewter-jawed saints who never had a selfish thought and for whom compromise was a foreign language. It is a very fine picture to hang in a schoolhouse, I suppose, but it strikes me as a falsehood of the most polished and uninteresting kind. I cannot help but imagine these deified gentlemen in the thick of it—sweating through their waistcoats in the summer heat, privately despising the oratorical style of the man next to them, and worrying chiefly about a sour stomach or a debt collector waiting back home. The official histories are always written as if men are made of marble, when any fool knows we are made of mud, anxieties, and an overwhelming desire for a decent meal.
