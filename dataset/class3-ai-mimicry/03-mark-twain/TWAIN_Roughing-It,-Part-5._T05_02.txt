I once shared a railcar, from Omaha clear to the dusty California line, with a man whose entire worldly fortune was tied up not in his satchel, but in a gaudy, gilt-edged certificate promising a mountain of silver for every dollar he’d scraped together. For two days he was a veritable geyser of optimism, a chattering spectacle of future triumphs who cornered every soul in the carriage to explain his infallible contrivance for plucking riches straight from the earth. Then, at a desolate depot where the only living things seemed to be the wind and the dust, a telegram was delivered. The geyser was capped. I never saw such a complete and sudden collapse of a man; his shoulders caved in as if the weight of that promised mountain had descended upon him all at once, and all the light drained right out of his eyes. He stared out at the passing alkali flats for the rest of the journey, as if he saw his own soul laid out there—a vast, shimmering expanse of absolutely nothing, promising a cool drink of water that a man could die of thirst just walking toward.
