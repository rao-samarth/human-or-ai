Their designated shepherd, a fidgety little man with a mustache that looked pasted on for the occasion, immediately began his work, pointing a gloved finger at a monstrous painting of some ancient scoundrel looking dyspeptic. He whispered his historical sermon with the gravity of an undertaker, and the entire herd swiveled their heads in perfect, reverent unison, as if their necks were connected by a single, well-oiled string. They gazed upon that sour-faced portrait with the same placid, dutiful awe they had no doubt employed for the cathedral that morning and would later use for their boiled beef at supper.
