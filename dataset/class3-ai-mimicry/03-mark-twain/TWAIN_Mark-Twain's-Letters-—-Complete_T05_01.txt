You all sit there, so certain in your cushioned chairs, passing judgment on entire continents as if you’d ordered them from a catalog, and I suppose I must make a full confession of my findings. Having worn out a considerable portion of my good nature—not to mention three sets of boots—I am here to testify that the world is not nearly so varied as a seed merchant’s almanac would have you believe. You can swap a man’s hat for a turban, change his bread for rice, and teach him to curse in a dozen new tongues, but you have not in the least altered the fundamental man. I have seen a fellow in pantaloons get into the very same lather over a disputed donkey that our own Deacon would get into over a misplaced hymn book. The scenery shifts, the weather conspires differently, and the food may threaten your very constitution, but the human animal, in all his petty grievances and his surprising decencies, remains the most stubbornly, dreadfully, and sometimes gloriously familiar creature you could ever hope to find.
