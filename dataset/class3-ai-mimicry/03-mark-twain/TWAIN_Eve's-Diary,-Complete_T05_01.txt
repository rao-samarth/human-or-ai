I reckon there’s a particular kind of quiet that settles over a valley just as the sun begins to think about its business for the day; it’s a hush so profound you’d swear the whole of creation was holding its breath in anticipation. And then the show commences—not with some great, clamorous announcement, but with a slow, magnificent wash of color that spills over the eastern hills, turning the mist in the hollows to a sort of liquid gold. A man can get so terribly wrapped up in the important-seeming troubles of his own making that he clean forgets to notice such a spectacle, which is a considerable pity. For I am convinced that a single one of these daybreaks holds more honest-to-goodness splendor and holy truth than all the gilded halls and fancy-built cathedrals in Christendom. It’s a free performance, mind you, and the best one on offer anywhere.
