In our town, we had a man of Law, a Mr. Abernathy, who had so thoroughly mastered the art of looking wise that he had long ago forgotten the tedious business of being it. If a man came to him with a simple dispute—say, over a mule that had kicked down a neighbor’s fence—Mr. Abernathy would purse his lips, steeple his fingers, and declare the situation to be rife with ‘precedential entanglements.’ He could speak for a solid hour without arriving at a point, leaving his client dazed, impressed, and none the wiser, which was the entire object of the exercise. The townspeople held him in the highest regard, for it is a peculiar human weakness to mistake the ornamental for the essential, and to believe that a man who uses five-dollar words to describe a fifty-cent problem must surely possess a genius that is simply too grand for common understanding. A hollow drum makes the most noise, and a hollow head, when it has learned the proper vocabulary, can do much the same.
