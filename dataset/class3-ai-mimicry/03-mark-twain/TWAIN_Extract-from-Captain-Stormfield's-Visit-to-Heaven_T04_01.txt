The old parson, a man whose certainties had been worn as smooth as river stones by seventy years of congregational nonsense, was explaining the narrowness of the celestial gate to a drummer for a patent medicine concern—a fellow with a vest so loud it could be heard in the next county. The parson insisted on a tidy, well-vetted population up there, but the drummer just laughed a great booming laugh that rattled the station-house windows. He figured the management Upstairs wasn't running some exclusive social club for the pious and the dreary; no, it was more like a grand hotel, a sprawling enterprise with room for all sorts. There'd be a wing for the gamblers, a noisy annex for the politicians, and a whole foggy valley for the philosophers to argue in for eternity. Why, the Almighty would find a corner for every last scamp and doubter, he declared, because a kingdom with only one kind of subject in it would be a mighty lonesome and unprofitable affair, a downright bore for all concerned. The parson could only blink, his tidy heaven suddenly seeming a terribly small and quiet place indeed.
