You can go on varnishing that story, sir, dressing it up in such fine and noble language that a saint himself might be tempted to weep at its tragic beauty. A man could admire the sheer industry of it, I’ll grant you that; you’ve hammered it and buffed it and put such a high-minded gloss on it that a fellow could almost see his own virtuous reflection in its surface, which is a considerable trick. But the trouble with a lie, no matter how gilded and grand, is that it’s got a shabby foundation, and it can’t long stand the company of a plain, unvarnished fact. That fact don’t need no polishing. It don’t need a fancy coat nor a preacher's blessing. It just sits there, being what it is—as solid and inconvenient as a mule in the middle of the road—and waits. And I do believe its waiting is about done.
