I saw old Mr. Hatcher slip the banknote into his waistcoat, as quick and quiet as a shadow. Well, a man’s conscience is a mighty particular and bothersome tenant in his soul; mine commenced to hollering about theft and company rules, making a racket fit to wake the dead. It hammered on about principle and duty, which are grand things to consider when it ain’t your own neck on the line. But then another part of me, a sneakin’, softer part, brought up a picture of Mrs. Hatcher and her lingering sickness, and the pile of apothecary bills I’d seen on their kitchen table. The loud part of me wanted to march right up to the head office and be a hero of accounting. The quiet part just wondered what sort of man gets a good night’s sleep by kicking another fellow when he’s already halfway down. It’s a perplexing business when the angel on your shoulder sounds an awful lot like a tattling fool.
