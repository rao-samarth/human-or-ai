There was a time, I reckon, when old Jedediah Hemlock could sit on his porch and look upon that stretch of bottom-land and see nothing more than God’s own handiwork—a fine place for a cow to get fat and for the sun to warm a fellow’s bones. But that was before the smooth-talking surveyor came through, jabbering about a new rail line and whispering figures that could make a parson start counting his neighbor's chickens. Now, the old man squints at that same peaceful creek not for its silver sparkle, but to calculate its potential for watering a thousand head of somebody else's cattle. The wildflowers have ceased to be anything but a nuisance taking up valuable soil, and he spends his evenings staring at Henderson’s fence, which sits on a durned quarter-acre that, by all rights of commercial sense and divine providence—as he now understands it—ought to be his own. A man’s soul, it seems, can be bought for a pittance and a promise, and he’ll hardly even notice the sale is complete.
