Old Man Fitzwilliam had a way of explaining company policy that bore no resemblance to the tidy handbook in the drawer; he was instructing young Abernathy on the sacred matter of inventory ledgers, and he wasn’t so much lying about the process as he was building a grand cathedral of falsehood around a single, humble brick of truth. A feller with less imagination would just say, “Count the widgets and write it down.” But Fitzwilliam, he spun a yarn about a legendary bookkeeper who once miscounted a shipment of brass spittoons—an error so catastrophic it nearly bankrupted the company and caused a three-day panic on the stock exchange, a panic felt from here to Timbuktu. The new boy swallowed it whole, of course, his pen trembling with the gravity of his new duties. Fitzwilliam just leaned back, a master architect admiring his work, knowing full well the only real consequence of a miscount was a mildly irritated supervisor and a bit of extra paperwork after lunch.
