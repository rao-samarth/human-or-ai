The thunder had rumbled its way over the ridge, and not a minute later Old Man Hemlock came scrambling through my gate, his eyes lit up with that particular brand of fire a man gets when he’s just had a private consultation with the architect of the universe. A bolt had splintered the dead hickory not twenty yards from his barn, you see, and to him this wasn't a matter of simple electricity taking the shortest route to the dampest ground; no, it was a clear and present declaration from on high. He was convinced he’d been personally spared for some grander work, though what that work might be for a man whose chief occupations were complaining about his lumbago and the price of feed, I could not venture to guess. Now, it seemed to me that lightning has a natural and long-standing prejudice in favor of the tallest object in a field, but I judged it wasn't the season for explaining natural philosophy. He stood there in the mud, arms thrown wide to the clearing sky, hollering his gratitude at the clouds as if they had ears and a particular interest in his mortgage.
