You believe there’s some common rulebook he and I are playing by? Lord, that’s a beautiful and ignorant fancy. A man like that is born with the world already tilted in his favor, so all the coin and all the luck slides directly into his pocket without him so much as lifting a finger. His gravest tragedy is a poor vintage of wine or a horse that places second; a kind of pampered misery that’s as foreign to our troubles as the moon is to a catfish. We are born into a game where the board is slicked with grease and all the dice are weighted, and we are told to be grateful for the chance to play at all. Don’t you see? He doesn’t look at you and see an equal soul—he sees a curious piece of machinery, useful for a time, and he feels no more malice toward you than a man feels for the hammer he’ll one day discard.
