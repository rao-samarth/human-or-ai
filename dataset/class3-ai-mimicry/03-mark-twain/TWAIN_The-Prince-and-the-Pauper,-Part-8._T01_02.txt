I spent a good hour this morning staring out at the south pasture, convinced a stranger was standing stock-still by the old stone wall. He was a patient sort, I’ll give him that; didn’t so much as twitch a muscle while the sun climbed and the crows held a noisy convention in the elm. I was about to fetch my walking stick and go investigate this fellow’s peculiar brand of loitering when the light shifted just so, and my stranger resolved himself into a warped and weathered fence post, a thing I’ve looked at ten thousand times. It does put a man to thinking. The whole world is got up in a costume, it seems to me—the shiniest apple often hides the most industrious worm, and the most pious-looking deacon can be the quickest to short-change you at the collection plate. That old post, now, it ain't trying to fool anybody; it’s man’s own foolish eyes that hang a coat and a story on it. In that way, I suppose a stick of wood has more honest-to-goodness integrity than half the upright citizens I’ve ever had the misfortune to know.
