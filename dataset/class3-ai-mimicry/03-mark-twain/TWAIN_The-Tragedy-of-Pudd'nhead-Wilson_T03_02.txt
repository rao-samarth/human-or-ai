A man might spend forty years in a black robe, sitting high on a bench and passing judgment on his fellows, and thereby convince the whole county—and, what is more perplexing, convince himself—that he is a pillar of profound wisdom. Such a man was Judge Abernathy, now retired to a small plot of land where his chief adversary was a wobbling fence post. He wrestled with it for the better part of an hour, his face turning a shade of purple that would’ve alarmed his physician, all the while achieving nothing but a series of undignified grunts. Then along came Silas, the mail carrier, a man whose chief public duty was to decipher bad handwriting. Without a word, Silas took a bit of stray wire, gave the post a smart kick and a clever twist, and the whole contraption stood as firm as a tax collector. The Judge stared, first at the solid post and then at Silas whistling his way down the lane, and for a brief, terrible moment, suspected the world was a grand piece of humbuggery built on little more than a costume and a good chair.
