The parlor was thick with the suffocating praise for my cousin, a man whose chief accomplishment was getting his name printed in the paper for some trifling civic committee. They passed him the best cut of roast and hung on his every pronouncement, for he was a man of *standing*—a notion that generally means he stands on the shoulders of better, quieter men. My gaze drifted to Uncle Silas, tucked away by the cold hearth, a fellow the world had passed by and whose opinion was valued less than that of the family dog. But I knew, and heaven knew, that Silas was the one who had pulled the banker's son from the frozen creek last winter, without a lick of fuss or expectation of reward, while my celebrated cousin was likely drafting a letter to the editor about the deplorable state of public footbridges. A man’s genuine value, I reckon, ain’t measured by the volume of the applause, but by the weight of the deeds he performs when no one is there to clap.
