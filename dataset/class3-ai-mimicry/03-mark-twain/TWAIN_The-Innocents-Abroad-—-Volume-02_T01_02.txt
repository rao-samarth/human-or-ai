A man is persuaded by poets and other such professional liars that a stormy midnight is the prime occasion for deep and solemn contemplation; that the soul is stirred to grand notions by the symphony of the wind and the drumming of the rain. Well, I am here to report otherwise. For an hour I have sat in this very chair, and the only soul-stirring discovery I’ve made is that the wind is not so much a symphony as it is a miserable draft working its way through the window sash. Furthermore, the drumming of the rain has a most unpoetic counterpoint, which is the steady, nagging *plink-plink-plink* into the basin I’ve set on the floorboards to account for a new leak in the ceiling. My deep contemplation has been entirely occupied with the probable state of my shingles and just how much a fellow who mends roofs might charge for his services on a Tuesday. It’s a peculiar sort of music that inspires a man to do nothing grander than worry about the cost of keeping dry.
