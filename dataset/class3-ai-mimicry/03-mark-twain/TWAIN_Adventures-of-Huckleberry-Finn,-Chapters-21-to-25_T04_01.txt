You ask me how a man of supposed character came to find his fingers so sticky. Well, sir, it don’t happen with a thunderclap. It begins as a whisper, a suggestion that a paltry sum—hardly enough to trouble the company's prodigious bottom line—might better serve a fellow in need of a new pair of boots. The first time, your conscience puts up a dreadful fuss, a regular caterwauling that keeps a man from his sleep. But the second time, it only whines a little; and by the twentieth, that durned thing is so hoarse it can’t do much more than squeak. Pretty soon, you find you ain't just borrowing for boots, but for cigars, and then for bets, until you've built a whole private enterprise right under the company's nose. You see, a man is an animal of opportunity, and leaving the henhouse door unlocked is just a plain invitation to supper.
