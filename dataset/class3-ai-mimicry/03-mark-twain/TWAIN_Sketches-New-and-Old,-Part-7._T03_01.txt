I went to Mr. Abernathy’s office to ask for a new box of pens, a simple enough errand, and one which ought to have been dispatched with a simple nod. But Mr. Abernathy, he has been to some manner of business school, and it has soured his tongue. He leaned back in his leather chair, a great and solemn ship of a man, and commenced to speak of “synergizing our asset-procurement protocols” and “leveraging inter-departmental communication streams to optimize resource allocation.” I stood there while the words washed over me, a great, warm, meaningless river of noise, and a peculiar sadness settled in my bones. Here was a man who had forgotten the plain names for things, who had traded the simple truth of a pen for a cloudy kingdom of important-sounding nonsense; and I could not help but feel I was watching a soul slowly burying itself under a mountain of its own fine words. It was a lonesome kind of spectacle.
