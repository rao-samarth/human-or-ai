Uncle Silas, his voice gone thick with pride and a little too much sherry, held court again by the fireplace, spinning out the old yarn of Great-Grandfather Alistair’s famous duel on the Natchez Trace. You could see the whole magnificent affair in his telling of it: the glint of moonlight on pistols, the cold nerve of a man defending his family's honor against some black-hearted scoundrel, a righteous shot that echoed through the swamp-pines and secured our name for all time. It was the story we had been raised on, the bedrock of our own small consequence in this world. And then Cousin Mary, quiet as a church mouse but armed with a terrible sort of factualness, slid a faded newspaper clipping across the damask tablecloth. The article made no mention of honor. It spoke of a drunken brawl over a crooked game of cards, and a clumsy, accidental discharge that put a hole in Alistair’s own foot. The silence that fell on that parlor was a heavier thing than any tombstone, for we were all witnesses to a hero dying a second, more permanent death, right there amongst the teacups.
