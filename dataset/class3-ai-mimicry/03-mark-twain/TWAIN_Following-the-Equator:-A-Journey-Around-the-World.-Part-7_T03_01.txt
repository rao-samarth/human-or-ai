The Sunday bell clangs out its summons, a regular and holy noise meant to convince a fellow that all is right with the world and his soul is accounted for. And yet, from my vantage on this porch, I see the truth of it in the patched trousers of the men and the perpetual worry etched around the women's eyes—a worry that no amount of scripture can smooth away. They shuffle along to hear about heavenly mansions, these good people, while their earthly ones leak and the winter woodpile is a sorry-looking affair. It seems a peculiar arrangement of Providence, to promise a man a feast in the next life whilst making him scrounge for crumbs in this one; it’s a brand of bookkeeping that would get a mortal man tarred and feathered for its plain and simple fraud. The whole enterprise strikes me as a kind of cosmic prank, and a mean one at that.
