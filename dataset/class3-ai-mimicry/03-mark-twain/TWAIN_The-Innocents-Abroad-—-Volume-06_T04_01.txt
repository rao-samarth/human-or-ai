Well, sir, when a man has spent the better part of a Tuesday morning attempting to decipher a company directive that was plainly written by a committee of ghosts from the last century—a directive that demands three separate signatures, in three different colors of ink, on a form that will ultimately be filed away in a cabinet nobody has opened since the great office flood of ’98—he begins to question the whole grand edifice of commerce. It’s a peculiar sort of madness. I put it to Henderson, who is a man of considerable authority and even more considerable attachment to procedure, that a simple electronic mail, taking all of ten seconds to compose and send, might accomplish the same end with a savings of time, ink, and general sanity. He looked at me as if I’d suggested we replace the foundation of the building with gingerbread. He said the Form 7-B has been the cornerstone of our inter-departmental communication protocol for fifty years. I reckon that’s the problem right there; a cornerstone is a mighty poor tool for sending a message, being heavy, silent, and generally immovable.
