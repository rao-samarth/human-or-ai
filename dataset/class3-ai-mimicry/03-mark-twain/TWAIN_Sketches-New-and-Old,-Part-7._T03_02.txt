The new councilman, Abercrombie—who’d been educated somewhere back East and acted like he’d swallowed a dictionary for breakfast—got to his feet to address the simple matter of the broken hitching post. He called it an "exigent deficiency in our municipal equine-tethering apparatus," and proceeded to orate for a solid quarter-hour on the "socio-historical significance of such utilitarian installations" and the "paramount necessity of a robust perpendicular timber." You could feel the good sense just evaporating from the room while he jawed on about it. Finally, Old Man Hemlock, who was deaf as the post in question, leaned over and hollered, “Is he for the new post or against it?” And that, right there, was the whole of the question. All that grammatical smoke and thunder boiled down to what a five-cent nail and a strong back could have settled without a single syllable wasted.
