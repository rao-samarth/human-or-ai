A man can get a powerful education in the various breeds of humanity just by watching the goings-on in a commercial house, and he don't have to pay a lick of tuition for it. You take young Mister Finney, a fellow with more thunder in his voice than a summer storm; he attacks his business like a terrier shaking a rat, slamming ledgers and shouting telegrams until the very windows rattle with his industry. By noon, he is sweating and triumphant, having accomplished a great deal of noise. And then you have Mister Ishikawa, who sits by the window, a man so placid and still you might mistake him for a piece of the furniture if he didn't occasionally sip his tea. He’ll look at a single piece of correspondence for an hour, his face showing no more emotion than a porcelain doll's, and a body would reckon he was the laziest man in the state. And yet, at the day’s end, you find his accounts are settled and his shipments are halfway to China, all done by some sorcery of silence that is a complete and confounding puzzle to a straightforward man.
