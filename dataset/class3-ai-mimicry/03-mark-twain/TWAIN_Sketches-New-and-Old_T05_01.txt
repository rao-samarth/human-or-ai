I found myself locked in a most unholy duel with a self-service cashiering device, a contraption of glass and blinking lights perpetrated upon an unsuspecting public. My opponent was a simple head of cabbage; a vegetable of no particular ambition, yet this machine treated it with the suspicion due a counterfeiter. “Unexpected item in the bagging area!” it shrieked, its voice the very essence of digital accusation. A small woman behind me tittered into her handbag. I lifted the cabbage, presented it again to the unblinking red eye—a futile offering to a tin god—and the calamity repeated itself. A righteous fury, the kind usually reserved for tax collectors and crooked politicians, began to boil in my veins. I leaned in close and whispered, “Listen here, you mechanized cabbage-hater,” at which point the woman’s tittering became a full-throated laugh, joined by the grocer himself. It seems a man’s private war on progress can be another’s public entertainment.
