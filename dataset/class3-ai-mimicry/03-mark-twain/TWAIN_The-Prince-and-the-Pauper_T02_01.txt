From the window of our railcar, I saw a spectacle of commerce so fine it would make a king blush—a mansion of white stone and glass perched on a hill, looking down upon the world as if it owned the very sunlight that glinted off its ridiculous cupolas. And right at its feet, huddled together like shivering cattle, was a village of shacks that looked as if they’d been built from the mansion’s leftover scraps and firewood. Now, a preacher might tell you this is all part of some grand and mysterious celestial plan, where one man is blessed with a gilded cage so another might learn the sterling virtue of want. It seems to me a mighty inefficient system for distributing virtue. If Providence was so keen on handing out lessons in humility, it’s a wonder it didn’t just make everybody poor to begin with and get the whole tedious business over with at once.
