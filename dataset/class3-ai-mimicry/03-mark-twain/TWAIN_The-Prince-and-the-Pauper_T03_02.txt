I confess I once held the popular opinion in this town that when a man’s fortunes turn sour, it’s the Almighty settling a private account for all the public to witness. I’d watch a neighbor, say a man like old Abernathy, get knocked flat by some calamity, and I’d nod along with the gossips, convinced it was the wages of some secret foolishness coming home to roost. It’s a comfortable and righteous perch, judging the drowning man from the safety of a riverboat—awfully easy to holler about his poor swimming. But a man ain’t truly equipped to understand the desperation of going under until he’s swallowed a gallon or two of that same muddy water himself. After you’ve felt that cold panic, that burning in your own lungs, you find you haven’t got the stomach for passing judgment anymore; you’ve only got a mind to throw the poor devil a rope.
