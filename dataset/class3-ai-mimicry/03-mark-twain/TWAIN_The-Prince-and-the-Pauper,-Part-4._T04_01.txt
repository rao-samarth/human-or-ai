The portly fellow, a banker whose chiefest misery had been a poorly-chilled bottle of champagne, went on at some length about his profound connection to the less fortunate souls his charity was meant to uplift. He puffed out his chest and spoke of “walking a mile in their shoes”—a mile, I wager, he’d expect to be paved, swept, and have a carriage waiting at the end. I finally had to interrupt his sermon. “Begging your pardon, sir,” I said, leaning in close enough to smell the brandy on his breath, “but a man who has only ever read the menu cannot claim to know the first thing about genuine starvation. You can study the theory of a blizzard from the comfort of a warm library, but that knowledge will not stop your teeth from chattering when you find yourself caught in one without a coat. Your pity is a fine and handsome thing, I’m sure, but it’s a counterfeit coin—it looks the part, but it won’t buy a man a crust of bread.”
