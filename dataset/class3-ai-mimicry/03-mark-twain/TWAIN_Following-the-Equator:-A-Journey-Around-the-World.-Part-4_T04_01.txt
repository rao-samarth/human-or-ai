I was conducted through the grandest avenues of that foreign capital, where polished stone and gilded spires reached for a heaven with which they plainly had no acquaintance. The fine ladies and gentlemen promenaded in their silks, their laughter like the tinkling of tiny, hollow bells, and they paid no more mind to the gaunt-faced men who built their palaces than they would a stray dog in the street. They toasted to progress and enlightenment, their crystal glasses held aloft, while just beyond the gaslights, a commerce of souls and broken backs was being traded for the very stones beneath their feet. It is a peculiar sort of savagery, is it not?—to build a cathedral to God with stones cemented by human misery, and then to kneel inside and piously pray for the salvation of all mankind. Why, a cannibal is at least honest in his appetites; he does not dress his meal in a tuxedo and call it philanthropy.
