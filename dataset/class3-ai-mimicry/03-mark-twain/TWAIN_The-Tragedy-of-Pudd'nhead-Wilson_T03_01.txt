It’s a curious thing to see how quickly a man’s station in life can be peeled off him, like the skin off a boiled potato. Out on Silas Blackwood’s porch, there sat the Judge, a man so full of his own importance he likely strained his suspenders just by breathing, and next to him the town’s most pious banker, who figured his ledger was a direct transcript from the angels. They were dispensing wisdom like a leaky barrel dispenses rainwater—slow and mostly useless. Then, from behind the smokehouse, came a sow with the devil himself riding her back, squealing a declaration of war on all mankind. Well, sir, the Judge’s legal opinions vanished in a flash. He vaulted the railing with a yelp that would shame a coyote, his fine coat snagging on a rosebush. The banker, forgetting all about interest rates and eternal salvation, scrambled up a trellis so fast you’d think he saw a foreclosed mortgage at the top. The pig, you understand, hadn’t read their credentials; it saw only two sacks of meat and bone in its way, which shows a hog’s opinion is sometimes the only one that ain’t built on pure folderol.
