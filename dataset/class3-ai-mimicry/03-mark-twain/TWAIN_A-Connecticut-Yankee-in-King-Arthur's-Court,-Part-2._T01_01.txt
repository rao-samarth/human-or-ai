There is a certain kind of man, generally the sort who sells things for a living, who will tell you the new telegraphic wire strung betwixt our town and the capital is the very pinnacle of human improvement. He will puff his chest and speak of commerce and the instantaneous transmission of vital intelligence—all the high-sounding notions that possess a fellow when he wishes to impress the postmaster. But I have observed that for every ounce of good tidings that comes ticking over that line, a full pound of misery follows close behind it. A bank has failed in the city before our own teller has even counted the morning’s cash; a cousin has taken ill three counties away; a war has been declared on some continent we couldn't find on a map. We have not so much conquered distance, it seems to me, as we have merely invented a more efficient and punctual courier for sorrow, delivering it fresh and piping hot right to our doorsteps when yesterday’s grief would have had the common decency to spoil on the long journey.
