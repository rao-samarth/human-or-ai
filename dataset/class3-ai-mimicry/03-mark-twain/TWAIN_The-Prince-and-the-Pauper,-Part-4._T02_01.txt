Well, it ain't every day a man finds his prize melon patch in such a state of pure ruination, but there was the culprit—a scrawny boy no older than ten, with melon juice and guilt all over his face. The righteous fury I’d been nursing all the way from the porch began to simmer down to a perplexing curiosity. It was a hot afternoon, the kind that boils the sense right out of a man, and the boy looked as if he hadn't seen a decent meal in a month of Sundays. I had a whole smokehouse full of bacon and a cellar groaning with preserves, and here was this little heathen risking a thrashing for a bit of sweet water. It struck me that doling out a hiding for a crime born of plain, honest hunger is a fool's errand. So I fetched a spoon and told the boy if he was going to steal a melon, he ought to do it proper and finish the job before the flies got to it, a piece of logic that seemed to satisfy us both a good deal more than a hickory switch ever could have.
