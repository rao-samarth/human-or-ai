The clock downstairs has just struck two, and the house is as quiet as a sinner on judgment day. I find my mind wanders best at these hours, when the world has the good sense to hold its tongue. You see, there’s a brand of pity in this world that is all polish and no substance; it’s the sort you find in a man who has always had a full plate and a warm coat, and he clucks his tongue at a shivering beggar as if it were a performance. But I tell you, true understanding—the kind that makes a man reach into his own near-empty pocket for a stranger—ain’t born in comfort. No, sir. It is forged in the miserable fires of your own want, when you’ve stared your own ruin in the face and seen how thin the line is between your respectable self and the poor devil in the gutter. It’s only then you learn that a hand up is worth a thousand well-wishes.
