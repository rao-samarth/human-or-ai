Old Man Hemlock picked up my certificate, holding the thing betwixt a thumb and forefinger as if it were a dead fish. “Well now,” he grumbled, his spectacles sliding down his nose, “ain’t that a handsome piece of sheepskin? Cost you four years of misery and your father a small fortune, I’d wager.” He handed it back with no ceremony whatsoever. “You take that document, son, a thing you near went blind studying to procure, and you figure you’ve climbed the highest peak in the territory. I will tell you a plain truth, however—that paper is nothing more than a ticket. It’s your paid admission to the real show, the one where the lessons are taught by the cruelest schoolmasters of all: bad luck and other people. You’ve finished the preface, is all; the book itself is a confoundedly long and difficult read. Now, stop admiring your own signature and fetch me the Henshaw file.”
