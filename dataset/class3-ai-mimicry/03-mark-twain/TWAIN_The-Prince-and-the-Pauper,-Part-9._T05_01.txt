I reckon the law is a mighty fine thing for keeping folks in line, but sometimes it’s as sensible as a woodpecker in a petrified forest. Just the other day I saw Constable Miller—a man who’d write you a citation for breathing too loud during a sermon—with his hand clamped on young Billy Aiken’s collar. The boy, who ain’t got two nickels to rub together, had pocketed a biscuit from the baker’s window sill, and Miller was puffing up his chest about statutes and public ledgers and the sanctity of commerce. It was a whole lot of thunder for such a small storm. Then the baker himself, ol’ Mr. Henderson, stepped out. He didn’t shout; he just looked at the constable’s grip and said, “Let him go, Abe. I left that one out there for him. A man’s got to balance his books, I suppose, but a boy’s empty stomach ain’t a debt to be collected so harshly.” Miller sputtered, his rule book suddenly feeling a bit thin, and let the boy scamper off. A man made of pure rules is a brittle thing, but a little charity seems to make him stronger somehow.
