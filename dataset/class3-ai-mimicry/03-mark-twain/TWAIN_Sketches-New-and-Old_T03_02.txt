My neighbor Jedediah had gone and acquired one of those newfangled automatic corn-shuckers, a contraption of such prodigious complexity that its instruction manual was thicker than a church bible and twice as full of damnation. It was guaranteed, the salesman swore upon a stack of legal papers, to shuck a bushel a minute with the pull of a single, elegant lever. Well, Jedediah pulled that lever with a flourish, and the machine gave a shudder, a groan, and then with a sound like a thunderclap, it launched an ear of corn clean over the barn and into the widow Henderson’s prize-winning pumpkin patch. We spent the better part of the afternoon trying to coax it back to its senses, consulting diagrams that looked like a spider’s fever dream and tightening bolts that had no earthly purpose. By sundown, we’d managed to get it to shuck exactly three cobs—mangling two of them into a pulpy sorrow—before it choked on its own gears and expired. Jedediah went back to doing it by hand, and I reckon he was a good deal happier for it, having discovered that progress is often just a more expensive way of getting less done.
