A man watches the endless parade of carriages rattle down the cobblestones, and he can’t help but notice the peculiar anatomy of importance in a great city. You’ll see a fellow, whose chief accomplishment in life was to be born, lean out his window with an air of profound ownership, as if he’d laid every stone himself and personally trained the pigeons not to despoil his hat. The world makes way for him, not because he is wise or decent, but because his father was. It’s a kind of inherited gravity. But then you might see a simple candlemaker settle a vicious argument between two cart drivers with such plain, unvarnished fairness that the whole street corner goes quiet to listen. That humble man, with wax under his fingernails, commands a respect the other fellow has to purchase with his name, and I know which currency holds its value when the accounts are truly settled.
