There is a particular species of history manufactured in an office, which bears only a passing family resemblance to the events it claims to chronicle. The week itself had been a spectacle of pure, unvarnished calamity—a symphony of dropped crates, misplaced invoices, and a singular incident involving young Peterson and a pot of ink that had no business being anywhere near the quarterly figures. This was the raw ore. From it, Mr. Abernathy, our chief clerk, was tasked with smelting a shining ingot of Progress. He would take up his pen and, with the judicious pruning of a few unfortunate verbs and the wholesale invention of a successful new procedure, construct an edifice of flawless operation. The final report, you see, was never meant to be a photograph of what happened; it was a handsome portrait of what *should* have happened, and once it was typed and bound, it became the only version of the tale anyone had the sand to remember.
