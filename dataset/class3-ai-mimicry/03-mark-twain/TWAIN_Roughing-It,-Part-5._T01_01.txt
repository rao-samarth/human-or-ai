You must understand, my friend, that the worth of the paper is scarcely the point. A man gets a notion—a whisper of a rumor, a wink from a fellow he trusts—that a patch of worthless swampland is the next paradise, and he will mortgage his soul to own a piece of it. He does not stop to think; thinking is the enemy of such an enterprise. His neighbor sees him running and begins to run himself, for fear of being the only man left standing still when the riches are handed out. Soon the whole town is in a dead sprint, chasing a fiction they all tacitly agree to believe, each man’s faith bolstered by the desperate faith of the next. They are not buying a future, you see; they are simply buying a temporary reprieve from the terror of being left behind. It is the most expensive purchase a man can make.
