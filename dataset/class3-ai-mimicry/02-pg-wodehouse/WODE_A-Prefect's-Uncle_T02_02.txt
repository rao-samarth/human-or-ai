My Aunt Dahlia, a woman who could stare down a charging rhinoceros and make it apologise for kicking up dust, cornered me by the potted ferns with a look of grim purpose. “A word about young Thomas,” she began, omitting the usual pleasantries. “This business with the Pinkerton boy is getting out of hand. Something about a newt and a cricket bat. You were at school once; what is one to do?” A sticky wicket, if ever there was one. I recalled my own frightful run-ins with a lanky specimen named Wiggins. “Well, Auntie,” I said, attempting a tone of worldly wisdom, “the thing about these youthful animosities is that they’re rather like bad sherry. Frightfully potent at first, you see, but they tend to mellow with age. The key, I’ve always found, is a masterly inactivity. Let the chaps stew. Perhaps one will deposit a frog in the other’s bed, the score will be considered settled, and they’ll be firm chums by tea-time.” She continued to fix me with that gimlet eye, plainly unimpressed by my strategic genius.
