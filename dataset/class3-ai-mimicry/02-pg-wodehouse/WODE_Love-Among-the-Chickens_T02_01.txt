The essential difficulty, you see, was Pringle. In any right-thinking establishment, a fellow wishing to exchange a pleasantry with the absolute angel who presided over the invoices department could simply amble over and get on with it. But our office manager, a blighter with a face like a disappointed bulldog and the soul of a particularly zealous parking warden, had turned her corner of the floor into a veritable fortress. My first attempt, a rather cunning ruse involving a feigned and desperate need for a paperclip of a specific, non-existent calibre, was scuppered before it even left the blocks. Pringle materialised from thin air, it seemed, proffering a whole box of the dashed things with a look that suggested he knew precisely what I was up to and would be reporting it to a higher authority at his earliest convenience. A sticky wicket, absolutely, but one must persevere; a new and far more subtle stratagem, this one concerning a 'mislaid' fountain pen, was already beginning to percolate in the old bean.
