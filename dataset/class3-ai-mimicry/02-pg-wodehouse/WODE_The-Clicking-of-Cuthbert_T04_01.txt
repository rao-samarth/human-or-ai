I had always mentally filed young Reginald Pootle under ‘Amiable Blank’, a chap whose deepest conviction was that a fellow ought to part his hair on the left, but I was forced to re-catalogue him entirely that afternoon in the tea-room at Sotheby’s. Some ruddy-faced buffer, a man who looked as if he’d been hewn from mahogany, had just dismissed the entire school of French Impressionism as ‘foreign daubs’, and a strange light entered Reggie’s eye. He rose slowly, a forgotten scone clutched in his fist, and the words began to pour from him. It was a Niagara of pure, unadulterated feeling. He spoke of light, of colour, of the shimmering soul of a haystack at dawn, his voice, usually a mild bleat, soaring with a strange, ringing authority that made dowagers lower their lorgnettes and strong-willed waiters pause mid-teapot. For three solid minutes, he was not Reggie Pootle, the chap who collected matchboxes, but a veritable crusader, a roaring apostle for Monet and Manet, and we all sat stunned, realizing we had been hobnobbing with a human volcano all this time without ever seeing the smoke.
