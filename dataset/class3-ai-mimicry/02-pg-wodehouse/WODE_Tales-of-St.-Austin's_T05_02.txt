As Uncle Mortimer’s voice continued its steady drone, a sound not unlike a distant and particularly disgruntled sawmill, I found myself doing a bit of deep thinking. One tries, of course, to maintain a suitably chastened expression when the family exchequer is being discussed—chin down, eyes respectfully on the Axminster—but the old grey matter churns on regardless. It struck me then, with the force of a wet sponge hurled by a competent hand, that this whole ghastly business with the patent self-warming teacosy had not been merely a spot of frightful luck. No, it had been a full-dress, orchestra-in-the-pit demonstration of my own spectacular nincompoopery. Hitherto, I'd always viewed these little financial shipwrecks as rummy cosmic jokes, but suddenly the penny dropped with a clang. The chap steering the vessel, the blighter who’d aimed it squarely at the rocks while whistling a jaunty tune, had been none other than yours truly. A sobering thought, that. Dashed sobering, in fact.
