My dear chap, you ask what I’m up to, and I must report that life at Ploverleigh has taken a decidedly rum turn. The proximate cause is young Cecil, who has been chafing somewhat under the iron rule of his Uncle Godfrey, a man whose smile, when it appears, looks like a crack in a tombstone. Godfrey, you see, had nurtured a prize cucumber for the local show—a cucumber he spoke of with the sort of hushed reverence usually reserved for royal visits. Well, it seems Cecil felt this cucumber was getting above itself. The night before the great event, the vegetable vanished, and in its place on the velvet cushion sat a single, rather defiant-looking banana, accompanied by a small card reading, “Gone tropical. Don’t wait up.” The ensuing uproar when Godfrey made the discovery was of a quality and volume that caused the starlings to abandon their nests in the west chimney. One can only hope the old boy’s blood pressure returns to a simmer by Michaelmas.
