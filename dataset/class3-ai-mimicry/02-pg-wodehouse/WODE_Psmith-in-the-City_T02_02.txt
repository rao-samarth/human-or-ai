I appreciate your position, Major, I really do. The path is clearly marked, isn’t it? A chap is meant to pop on the correct collar, adopt the approved facial expression for viewing quarterly reports, and generally merge with the background like a well-behaved chameleon. It’s the done thing. But when a fellow's very soul rebels at the prospect—when his inner man, so to speak, puts its foot down and refuses to be shoehorned into a life of ledger-balancing—what's to be done? One can't simply tell it to pipe down and think of the dividends. It's a matter of principle, you see. To surrender the very thing that makes one distinct from the next cove in a bowler hat would be a form of spiritual suicide, and a dashed messy one at that. I may be a lone bassoon in an orchestra of violins, sir, but by Jove, I intend to play my note.
