My dear chap, you were asking after young Pilkington and his great foray into the world of commerce. Well, the entire enterprise has rather come a cropper, I’m afraid, and all due to a flash of what the poor blighter mistook for genius. You see, he concocted a new filing system for the firm, a frightfully intricate affair involving coloured tabs and some sort of cross-referencing scheme based on the astrological signs of the board members’ wives. To prove its mettle, he chose the all-important Abernathy contract as his demonstration piece, tucking it away in what he assured old Abernathy himself was its new, hyper-efficient home. The moment of truth arrived, Abernathy bellowed for the document, and Pilkington, with the air of a magician about to produce a string of sausages from a hat, strode to his cabinet. Dashed unfortunate, then, that he’d forgotten whether Mrs. Abernathy was a Leo or a Pisces, a distinction upon which the entire bally system hinged. The last I saw of him, he was frantically leafing through a star-chart while the guv’nor, turning a rather vivid shade of plum, threatened to have him personally audit the firm’s paperclips for the next decade.
