I’ve always found that the chaps who run things possess a peculiar knack for speaking a language that sounds frightfully important while signifying absolutely nothing, and my new boss, a bird named Finsbury, is a master of the art. He summoned me to his office this morning, a room so modern it looked like the inside of a milk bottle, and started going on about the necessity of “actualising our vertical integrations.” He had the sort of earnest, bulging-eyed expression a frog might wear if you told it a shocking piece of gossip, and he waved his hands about a good deal. I nodded sagely, trying to look as if I actualised a vertical integration or two before breakfast every morning, but the old bean was a complete blank. He then said we needed to “incentivise our synergistic throughput,” at which point I simply gave up. I just murmured, “Right-ho,” and hoped he wouldn't ask me to spell it, feeling that the most synergistic throughput for me would be a swift exit followed by a restorative luncheon.
