Dash it all, the blighter was a veritable phantom! I lunged left, my net swishing through empty air like a spectral lacrosse stick, then pivoted right, nearly taking a header into a patch of what I suspected were cowslips. It was a proper chase, a full-pelt, heart-in-the-mouth affair that left one breathless and invigorated. A rummy sort of business, really, when you considered that only a fortnight ago my most strenuous activity involved stapling memoranda in triplicate and ensuring the Henderson account’s figures didn’t give the senior partners a collective apoplexy. That was a different kind of pursuit, you see—a ghastly, soul-withering marathon from one grey Tuesday to the next, with the only prize being the privilege of doing it all again on Wednesday. Give me a fiendishly evasive Purple Emperor any day; at least when you missed, you only looked a fool to the daisies.
