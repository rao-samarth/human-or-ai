It’s a rummy business, when you stop to ponder it—this whole affair of simply not giving up. I look at this rose garden now, a thing of beauty and a joy forever and all that sort of rot, and find it dashed difficult to reconcile with the chump who started it. That fellow, I recall, was more of an artist in the business of chucking in the towel; if a thing wasn't a breeze from the word go, he'd be off to the nearest hammock with a stiffish brandy. The early days here were a proper sticky wicket, all thorns and blighted buds, enough to make a chap question his fundamental sanity. Yet, somehow, I gritted the old teeth and ploughed on, day after bally day. And now, blow me down if I haven't become the sort of cove who knows his aphids from his elbow. A reformed character, what? Positively stalwart.
