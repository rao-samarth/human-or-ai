It is a peculiar thing, and one that often assails the thoughtful man when he finds himself rattling through the shires in a third-class carriage, how the essential substance of humanity remains stubbornly the same, no matter the backdrop. One gazes out upon a field wherein a stout party in corduroys is wrestling with a recalcitrant gate, his brow furrowed with the sort of deep, existential care that one usually associates with having forgotten a vital wedding anniversary. Back in the metropolis, his counterpart—let us say a slick-haired young man in spats—is likely experiencing the very same spiritual anguish, only his gate is a formidable club doorman and the field is the stony heart of some damsel he wishes to take to the pictures. It leads one to a rather profound conclusion: whether your particular spot of bother involves a prize-winning pig that’s gone off its feed or a financier who’s gone off your latest speculative venture, the fundamental sensation of being well and truly in the soup is, at its core, a universal constant.
