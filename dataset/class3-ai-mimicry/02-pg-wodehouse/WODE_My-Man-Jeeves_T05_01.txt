It was at the Abernathy garden party that young Reginald, operating under the spectacularly flawed assumption that he possessed a light and witty touch with the dowager class, elected to open a conversation with his hostess. He proceeded, with a cheerfulness that would have seemed excessive in a music-hall comedian, to compare her prize-winning delphiniums to the sort of thing one might find sprouting from a forgotten jam-pot. A glacial quiet descended upon the croquet lawn, of a kind so profound you could almost hear the earthworms reconsidering their life choices. This, I saw, was not a matter for brute force but for delicate, almost surgical, intervention. A quiet word with a footman concerning the sudden and urgent need for champagne near the rose bushes, a strategically engineered coughing fit to draw attention to the far gazebo, and a casually floated theory to a nearby Bishop on the horticultural benefits of rustic neglect were all that was required. The crisis, which a moment before had loomed like a thundercloud, simply evaporated, leaving behind only the faint, lingering scent of Reginald’s cluelessness.
