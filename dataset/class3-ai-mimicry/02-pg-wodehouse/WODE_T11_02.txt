My dear Cuthbert, it is now some ungodly hour when only the owls and the butlers are astir, and a fellow’s mind turns to the deeper questions. I’ve been observing our host, Sir Roderick, and I’ve concluded that there’s a species of invisible chalk line drawn around certain persons. When that chap Pootle, the one who made his pile in dog biscuits, was holding forth, Sir Roderick listened with the sort of pained civility a man reserves for a faulty drainpipe—necessary, but not to be encouraged. Yet, ten minutes later, in wanders young Freddie Fitzwilliam, a cove who famously can’t afford his own socks, and the old boy practically fawns on him, clapping him on the back and offering him the sort of cigar one normally keeps for visiting royalty. It’s not a question of cash, you see; it’s some other, unspoken currency. Some chaps are simply born inside the club, as it were, while others, no matter how much they jingle, are left on the doorstep wondering why the bell doesn’t work. A rummy state of affairs, if you ask me.
