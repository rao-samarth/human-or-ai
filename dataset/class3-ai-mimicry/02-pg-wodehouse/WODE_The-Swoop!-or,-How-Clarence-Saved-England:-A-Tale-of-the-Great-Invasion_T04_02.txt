One found oneself drifting through the evening’s festivities with the sort of muted spirit usually reserved for a Monday morning interview with one’s bank manager. Around the punchbowl, a small cluster of chaps, who ought to have been discussing the rather decent watercolours on the walls, were instead huddled over the early edition of some dreadful illustrated sheet.

It was all rather rum, this modern appetite for the shrieking headline over the steady, quiet fact of things. You felt the whole affair had rather missed the point, leaving one with a dashed empty feeling, as if you’d ordered steak-and-kidney pudding and been served only the steam.
