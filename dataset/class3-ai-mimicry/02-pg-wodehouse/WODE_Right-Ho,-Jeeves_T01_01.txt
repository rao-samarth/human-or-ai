The train rattled on, making a sort of mournful music that suited the mood down to the ground. It is a dashed peculiar feeling, I found myself thinking, to have waded into a perfectly stable situation with the sole object of improving it, only to leave it looking like a dropped jelly. One sees two people, you understand, not quite hitting the right note together, and it seems the simplest thing in the world to step in and, with a deft touch here and a quiet word there, act as the tuning fork. My own efforts, however, appeared to have had the effect of a spanner dropped into a grand piano during a recital. The resulting silence from both parties was ghastly, far worse than the original discord. Looking out at the grey, drizzling fields, I couldn't help but feel that some chaps are simply not built to be conductors of life’s orchestra; they are, at best, the fellow in the back who coughs at the crucial moment.
