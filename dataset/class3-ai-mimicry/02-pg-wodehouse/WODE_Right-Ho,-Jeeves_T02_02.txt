It was during Lady Agatha’s annual musicale, an event generally considered a high-water mark for organised suffering, that I witnessed a quiet masterpiece of generalship. Young Freddie Pilkington, a chap whose brain-pan seemed to contain little more than fluff and the odd sporting regulation, had conceived a truly ghastly scheme to liven up the proceedings by releasing a brace of white doves during the soprano’s high C. One needed no special gift of prophecy to foresee the ensuing chaos—the shrieking, the fluttering, the inevitable collision of bird and chandelier. Indeed, the very air crackled with impending doom. Yet, as the fateful moment approached, Freddie was seen to be gently but firmly steered toward the conservatory by none other than old Carmichael, his uncle, who engaged him in a seemingly vital discussion about the migratory habits of the common garden snail. The soprano hit her note unmolested, the chandelier remained intact, and the doves, one later learned, were enjoying a generous portion of birdseed in a cage at the back of the house. It was a simple, bloodless victory, a triumph of quiet forethought over loud, feathered imbecility.
