My dear Cuthbert, you ought to have been here last night; the brain-power on display was enough to short-circuit a lighthouse. Young Percival, whose own intellect is of the sort that struggles to get its boots on the right feet, was lecturing a small, trapped-looking group on the 'metatextual dissonance of the modern teacake'. I gathered, between yawns, that this was something frightfully significant. All around him, earnest young women with severe haircuts and chaps who looked like anxious storks were murmuring about dialectical materialism and the inherent symbolism of a misplaced doily. It was the sort of high-minded affair where, if you so much as mentioned the rather spiffing score in the afternoon's cricket match, you’d be looked upon as a microbe that had somehow blundered into the Royal Society. It was all a bit much for a simple fellow, I can tell you, and I retreated to the library for a quiet browse of the sporting gazette.
