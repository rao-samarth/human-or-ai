The little fellow in the middle of the street crossing was, one had to concede, giving it the old college try. Vested in a rather tight-fitting blue uniform and an air of self-importance that would have seemed excessive in a proconsul, he waved his arms with the decisive snaps of a man directing an invading army. His face, a study in outraged beetroot, was set in the grim lines of a chap who has discovered a slug in his salad and is holding the waiter personally responsible. He would inflate his chest, purse his lips for a piercing toot upon his whistle—a sound immediately swallowed by the city’s roar as a minnow is by a whale—and then point a quivering, white-gloved finger at some citizen who had failed to toe the line. The citizen, however, invariably proved to be a master of the art of not noticing, and would simply continue on his way, leaving the little official revolving on the spot, a sputtering teapot of indignation in a world that had criminally mislaid the milk jug of deference.
