Young Algernon felt his soul curdle in a most unpleasant fashion, much like milk left out during a thunderstorm. His orders, delivered that morning by an aunt who bore a striking resemblance to a disgruntled eagle, had been crystal clear: he was to corner old Blevinsworth of the Blevinsworth Jam fortune and not release him from his conversational clutches until the cheque for the Dower House’s new roof was practically signed. It was a sacred trust, a matter of familial honour, and all that sort of rot. And yet, across the shimmering ballroom floor, he spied Penelope, the apple of his eye and the jam in his doughnut, being clearly mesmerised by the ghastly patter of that lounge lizard, Cecil. To abandon his post would be to invite the full force of Aunt Honoria’s wrath—a terrifying prospect—but to stand by while Cecil worked his dubious magic was, frankly, more than a fellow could be expected to bear. The whole ghastly business put a chap in a proper pickle.
