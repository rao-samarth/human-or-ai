The whole kerfuffle, as I later pieced it together, sprang from young Cecil’s unfortunate habit of hearing what he expected to hear rather than what was actually said. Tasked by his aunt with retrieving the prize boar for the annual village fete—a simple enough directive for a fellow with all his mental faculties firing correctly—he had instead processed the instruction as “fetch the prize bore.” Consequently, while a magnificent pig named Percival was left cooling his trotters in a distant sty, the esteemed Major-General Flitch, a man whose anecdotes about tiger-hunting could anaesthetise a charging rhinoceros at fifty paces, found himself being ceremoniously escorted toward the festivities. The Major-General, naturally assuming he was to receive some long-overdue award for services to the community, puffed out his chest and beamed with a radiance that could have powered a small lighthouse. It was, all things considered, a rather sticky wicket, but one from which the village extracted a solid gold chuckle that lasted well into the winter months.
