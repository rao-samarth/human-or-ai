My dearest Mildred, you enquired after the great marrow affair, and I must report that Uncle Roderick is still breathing fire and brimstone. He remains utterly convinced that young Perkins next door is the fiend responsible for the dastardly act of nocturnal sabotage upon his prize-winning vegetable, and his mind has turned to what he considers a wholly appropriate counter-stroke—namely, introducing a squadron of particularly voracious snails into Perkins’s prize-winning delphiniums. I ventured to suggest that this course of action, while emotionally satisfying, strayed a trifle from the straight and narrow path of what one might call equitable retribution. He, of course, sees it as the only decent thing for a wronged man to do, a swift and personal balancing of the celestial books. Still, one can't help feeling there's a world of difference between that sort of thing and the measured, impartial verdict a committee of chaps might hand down. It all boils down to who’s holding the scales, I suppose—the fellow whose marrow has been nobbled, or some disinterested blighter with no dog in the fight. A dashed tricky business, what?
