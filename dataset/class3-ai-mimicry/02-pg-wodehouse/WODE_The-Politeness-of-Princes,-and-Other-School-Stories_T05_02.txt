So there I was, old man, peacefully perusing a slim volume of verse on a park bench, when this absolute monolith in a uniform—a creature seemingly constructed entirely of indignation and brass buttons—hove into view and began making noises like a faulty steam-whistle. It appeared that my dog, a genial terrier of spotless character named Pongo, had committed some unpardonable sin against a municipal flowerbed. I attempted to reason with the fellow, pointing out that Pongo was merely admiring the petunias, a well-known trait in the more artistically-inclined members of his breed. This, I can tell you, was rather like attempting to quell a volcano with a polite cough. He began to swell visibly, his face taking on the hue of a ripe plum, and launched into a diatribe on civic regulations that drew a small but distinctly entertained crowd from the nearby tea-pavilion. I daresay we brightened their afternoon considerably; one simply doesn’t get that sort of free theatre every day.
