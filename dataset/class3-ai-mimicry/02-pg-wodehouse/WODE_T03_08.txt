I found myself wedged between a potted fern that tickled the ear and old Lady Twingecombe, whose hearing aid emitted a low, continuous whistle like a distant kettle coming to the boil. It was, in short, a tight spot, made all the tighter by my Uncle Eustace, who was at that very moment holding forth at the far end of the table. He was well into the anecdote concerning myself, a stolen bathtub, and the Bishop of Plimsoll—an account which, I might add, had been embellished with each retelling until it bore as much resemblance to the original mild incident as a charging rhinoceros does to a pet hamster. To let it stand would be to brand myself for all time in the eyes of this assembled company as a sort of bathtub-nicking buffoon. No, a fellow simply can’t have that sort of thing said about him, not if he wants to be able to look his club’s head waiter in the eye ever again. It strikes at the very foundations. One has to make a stand, even if it means interrupting a man in full, booming sail and causing a frightful scene with the sherry trifle.
