It was well past the witching hour, and a rummy sort of stillness had settled over the ancestral pile, but sleep remained a distant shore. The source of my nocturnal agitation, a beastly tweed waistcoat, lay draped over a chair, looking for all the world like a dead badger. My aunt, a woman who considered a splash of colour to be the first step on the slippery slope to outright bolshevism, had insisted upon it for the Vicar's impending tea-and-buns shindig. 'All the right sort of young men are sporting them,' she had boomed, fixing me with that gimlet eye of hers. And there, don't you know, was the nub of it. The very thought of being willingly absorbed into the grey, homogenous mass of 'the right sort of young men'—a dreary procession of fellows who likely thought a risqué thought once in 1922 and had been apologising for it ever since—was enough to give a chap the heebie-jeebies. No, I decided, giving the waistcoat a final, disdainful prod. Tomorrow, the canary-yellow cravat with the purple spots would get its outing. A fellow must draw the line somewhere, what?
