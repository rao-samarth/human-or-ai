The moment young Filbert pressed the button marked 'Commence Projection', the contraption on the table, a new-fangled device that was supposed to revolutionise the quarterly report, emitted a sound not unlike a cat being introduced to a cold bath against its better judgement. Old Man Hemlock, a chairman whose smile was a rare and terrifying spectacle, began to tap a silver pen on the mahogany, each tap a miniature drumbeat of doom. It was then that Perkins, a well-meaning soul from Human Resources whose primary function in the office was to be a well-meaning soul, decided to intervene. With the sort of breezy confidence that so often precedes a cataclysm, he gave the projector a hearty slap on its flank. The machine, resenting the familiarity, promptly coughed up a cloud of acrid smoke and projected a single, blurry image of what appeared to be Perkins’s holiday snaps—specifically, a close-up of a prize-winning marrow—before expiring with a faint, apologetic sigh. One felt for Filbert; it was a sticky wicket, and he hadn't the bat for it.
