Young Bertram found himself in what the poets would call a pretty pickle, pinned against a tobacconist’s window by the sheer, unyielding mass of humanity that constituted a Tuesday afternoon on the Strand. The chief obstacle, a large, beefy specimen of manhood who seemed to be under the impression that shouting ‘Make way!’ would cause the crowd to part like the Red Sea, was only making matters worse, a sort of human traffic-jam in and of himself. While this animated pillar-box bellowed himself puce, Bertram, with the quiet resourcefulness of a chappie who has spent more time with books than with dumb-bells, simply spotted a dropped glove a few feet ahead. A quick, polite ‘Pardon me, sir, I believe that’s yours!’ aimed at a gentleman beyond the obstruction did the trick. A small channel opened—a brief window of opportunity. Bertram nipped through it with the agility of an eel in a hurry, leaving the bellower to conduct his one-man shouting match with the indifferent metropolis. The world, he reflected as he resumed his course, wasn’t such a bally muddle after all if you just used the old bean.
