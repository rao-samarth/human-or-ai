Staring out at the village green, a sort of clammy sensation began to make its presence felt about the old spinal column, and I don't mind admitting it. It was the Aunt Agatha situation. Not that she was here, thank goodness—the mater had packed her off to Harrogate to take the waters—but her letter, sitting on the mantelpiece, radiated a sort of chilly disapproval that you could feel from across the room. She was expecting me to “make a good impression” on the local squire, a formidable sort of buffer, by all accounts, who judged a man by the cut of his plus-fours. The trouble was, my man, Billings, in a moment of what I can only describe as profound cerebral collapse, had packed the checked pair, the loud ones that practically yodel at you from the wardrobe. To appear before the squire in that sort of leg-wear would be tantamount to slapping him on the back and calling him "Sport." The entire social fabric of the county was hanging by a single, brightly-coloured thread. It was enough to put a chap off his breakfast kipper.
