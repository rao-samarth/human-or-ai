The countryside was whizzing by in a rather agreeable green smudge, but young Cuthbert, sitting opposite, was taking no notice whatsoever, being far too busy simmering over the Sidcup affair. He maintained, with a certain amount of fist-clamping, that what he planned for this blighter wasn't merely getting his own back, but was, in fact, the administration of a long-overdue dose of cosmic equity. It struck me as a rummy sort of business, this, because the scheme he’d outlined—which involved a pot of glue and Sidcup’s prize-winning homing pigeon—seemed to differ rather profoundly from the simple matter of seeing a chap get his proper comeuppance. One feels like the scales are being balanced by some unseen hand, you see, while the other feels an awful lot like you’re the one tipping the scales with a thumb and a half. The chap who has just had his best hat trodden on is seldom, I’ve found, the most impartial judge of what constitutes a fitting sentence for crimes against headwear, and it becomes dashed difficult to know where fairness stops and simply biffing a fellow back begins.
