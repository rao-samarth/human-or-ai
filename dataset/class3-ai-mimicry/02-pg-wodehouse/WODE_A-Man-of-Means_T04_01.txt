It was a rummy sort of business, watching old Uncle Percival navigate the Strand. No sooner had his wallet—a monstrous affair of crocodile skin, positively bulging with the ready—made a brief appearance than the populace seemed to materialise out of thin air. One chap with a frightful moustache wanted to sell him a patent for unsinkable boots; another was convinced Percy needed to finance an expedition to find a new type of moth, and a third, a rather alarming-looking blighter, simply followed him with a hopeful expression and an open palm. They swirled about him like wasps round a jam-pot, each with a scheme more barmy than the last. I waved from across the street, but he was far too engrossed in his new-found companions to notice. It just went to show what a popular and engaging fellow the old fruit was, really, to command such immediate attention from absolute strangers.
