It is in the small hours, when the last guest has finally been prized from the chesterfield and sent on his way, that one falls into a properly philosophical mood. One begins to see the whole bally show for what it is—a sort of intricate dance where everyone is concentrating frightfully hard on not treading on anyone else’s toes, and consequently ends up looking like a flamingo with a sudden attack of the staggers. Consider old Boffington getting into a state about the missing decanter of port; a man who advises chancellors on fiscal policy, mind you, looking for all the world like a bereaved spaniel simply because his post-prandial tipple had gone astray. It’s these little glimpses behind the curtain, when the solemn old bird reveals the squawking gosling within, that truly fortify the soul against the general bleakness of things. Without them, we should all be frightfully sensible, and what a ghastly state of affairs that would be.
