I had always considered old Boffin, my uncle’s head gardener, to be little more than a sentient pair of corduroys with a strong opinion on slugs. He would nod, touch his cap, and grunt in what I took to be the rustic dialect for ‘Yes, sir,’ or possibly ‘It’s going to rain, you blithering idiot.’ It was only when I chanced to suggest a rather clever new pruning technique I’d read about—something involving a more democratic approach to the stronger stems—that the man truly came to life. The effect was electric. He dropped his trowel, fixed me with a glittering eye I hadn't known he possessed, and for a solid three minutes delivered a peroration on the sacred duties of the rosarian that would have made a barrister blush. It was a Niagara of Latin names, talk of apical dominance, and dark prophecies concerning black spot, all delivered with the fire of a prophet who has just seen the abyss yawn. I stood corrected, feeling rather like a small newt that has offered swimming lessons to a shark.
