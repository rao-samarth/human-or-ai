I was minding my own business over a pot of tea and a well-buttered scone at a little establishment off the Strand, the sort of place where the muffins know their station, when my attention was rather drawn to the conversation at the neighbouring table. Two young chaps, all side-partings and confident opinions, were casting a critical eye over a new arrival—a small, blinky sort of specimen, the kind of fellow you feel ought to be kept under a glass dome, who was pottering about in a suit that looked as though it had been slept in by a fairly restless elephant. "Complete non-entity, what?" murmured the first, and the second agreed that you wouldn't trust the blighter to post a letter without ending up in Shropshire. It was at this precise moment that a large, fearsome-looking woman, who bore a distinct resemblance to a disgruntled battleship, steamed into view, clearly intent on delivering a fourteen-inch salvo, only for the blinky cove to step forward, murmur something brief and inaudible, and cause the entire dreadnought to execute a smart turn-about, beam benevolently, and sail peacefully from the premises. The jaws of the two critics had dropped to a point where they were in imminent danger of scooping up loose crumbs, which just goes to show you can't always tell what's under the bonnet simply by kicking the tyres.
