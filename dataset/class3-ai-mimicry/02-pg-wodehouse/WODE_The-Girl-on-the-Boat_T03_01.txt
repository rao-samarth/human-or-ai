It was one of those Sunday afternoons that seem to be composed entirely of digestive biscuits and quiet desperation. From the armchair where she held court, Aunt Dahlia’s sister—a woman who looked as if she had been carved from a particularly unyielding piece of mahogany—was explaining the correct way to appreciate opera, a subject on which her knowledge was, to put it charitably, on the slim side. She used words like *tessitura* and *verismo* with the grim confidence of a small boy brandishing a water pistol, while Uncle Percival, who had the intellectual horsepower of a sleeping dormouse, nodded sagely. A fine drizzle had begun to mist the windowpanes, blurring the garden into a watercolour of greens and greys, and a profound sort of weariness settled upon my soul. The whole affair felt less like a family gathering and more like a frightfully earnest, if poorly rehearsed, play in which everyone had forgotten why they were on stage in the first place.
