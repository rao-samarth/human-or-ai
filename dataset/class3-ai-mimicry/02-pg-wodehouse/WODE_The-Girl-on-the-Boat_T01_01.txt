It struck me then, as the grandfather clock in the hall wheezed its way towards three in the morning, that the entire enterprise of the heart is conducted on principles that would get a chap cashiered from any respectable business. One does not, after all, select a new motor-car based on the soulful quality of its headlamps or a vague feeling that its chassis possesses a certain poetry, what? No, one kicks the tyres and inquires sternly about its mileage. Yet here we are, expected to hitch our wagons for the full, bumpy duration to another human being based on little more than a fetching dimple or a shared antipathy for modern poetry. The whole affair is a positive minefield of illogicality, a system seemingly devised by a committee of sentimental lunatics. It’s the sort of thing that makes a man feel that the only truly rational companion in the wee small hours is a substantial splash of soda in a glass of something fortifying.
