It was well past two in the morning, an hour when all decent chaps are supposed to be getting their eight hours, but sleep, I found, was a dashed shy commodity. The image of Cuthbert beaming over his glass of celebratory port, having apparently secured the doting favour of Aunt Agatha and her not-inconsiderable fortune, kept replaying behind the old eyelids like some ghastly theatrical revue. One had to grant the man a certain flair, I suppose, if you’re the sort who admires the slick efficiency of a vacuum-cleaner salesman closing a deal. But to see Aunt Agatha, a woman who could spot a forged ten-shilling note from across a foggy lane, positively melting under that patent-leather smile of his—it was enough to make one ponder the fundamental injustices of the cosmos. I mean, what had this Cuthbert fellow ever done, beyond inheriting a robust chin and a knack for remembering which teacakes gave her the vapours? It fair curdled the soul, it really did.
