It’s a rummy sort of business, standing here amidst the general maelstrom of humanity, watching the chaps with purposeful expressions dash hither and yon. To the casual observer—say, that stout party currently trying to hail a taxi with the fury of a thwarted warlord—I daresay I present the picture of a fellow who has rather lost the plot; a mild, blinking cove whose chief ambition is to avoid being trodden on by a horse. One can practically hear them thinking, “There goes a soul who’d crumple at the first sign of a cross-eyed Pekinese.” And yet, beneath this placid exterior, the inner man is as solid as a butler’s conscience. The foundations, you see, are sound. While the world fusses and fumes, convinced it’s all a frightfully important to-do, I find I possess a quiet, un-budge-able certainty that is really quite comforting, much like finding an unexpected ten-shilling note in an old waistcoat pocket.
