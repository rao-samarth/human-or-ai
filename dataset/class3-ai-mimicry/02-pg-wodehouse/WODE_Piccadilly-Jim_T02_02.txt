It was one of those evenings in the shires when the world seems to have paused for breath, the sun sinking behind the elms like a well-fed bishop retiring for the night. I watched a lone beetle trundling across the flagstones, a chap with a clear objective and no nonsense about him, and it struck me as a rum sort of business, this human scramble. All that jostling and elbow-work to get one’s photograph in the glossy weeklies; the frightful expenditure of energy simply to be nodded at by some pop-eyed peeress who wouldn't know you from Adam's off-ox a week later. The beetle, you see, had it right. He wasn't trying to impress the other beetles or get his name put up for some august institution in Pall Mall. He just wanted to get to the other side of the stone, and it occurred to me that there was a certain quiet dignity in that which you didn't often find in the drawing-rooms of Mayfair. A dashed sight more, if you asked me.
