It strikes a fellow as a singularly rum business, this whole enterprise of establishing that one did not, in fact, do the thing one has been accused of doing. As I watched my Uncle Algernon holding court by the fireplace, pinning poor Cuthbert to the wall—metaphorically, of course, though Algy looked game for the real thing—over the small matter of a purloined bottle of port, I couldn't help but ponder the mechanics of it. One can state one's case, naturally, with all the trembling earnestness of a schoolboy explaining a broken window, but what is that against the granite certainty of the accuser? It is, when you get down to brass tacks, a matter of attempting to prove a negative; one is asked to produce concrete evidence of an event that never occurred, a task that would baffle a far brainier specimen than poor old Cuthbert, who at that moment looked precisely like a goldfish that has been unexpectedly informed of its eviction.
