“I say,” I ventured, attempting to deflect the conversation towards the less strenuous topic of the weather, “this railway carriage does jiggle a bit, doesn’t it?” My companion, a ferociously energetic cove from the Americas named Finch, merely waved a dismissive hand, his gesture nearly upsetting the porter’s entire tray. “Forget the jiggle, buddy, think of the leverage! We install a small, automated shoe-shining device under every seat—coin-operated, of course. We call it ‘The Go-Getter’s Gloss!’ It’s the future in footwear!” He beamed with a voltage that could have jump-started a dead omnibus. The notion of introducing whirring brushes and flying polish into the already chaotic proceedings of public transport struck me as an idea that only a certified chump would entertain. “But the frightful mess?” I mumbled feebly. “My dear man,” he boomed, leaning in with a conspiratorial zeal that was frankly unnerving, “there’s no mess in a disruptive vertical market! Only profit! Are you in or are you out?” I could only blink, feeling much like a placid garden snail being consulted on the finer points of aeronautics.
