I was comfortably ensconced in my usual armchair at the club, observing the final, tense moments of an arm-wrestling contest between old Reginald Fitzherbert and a new cove named Stoker. Now, Fitzherbert is a man whose upper arms suggest a close and personal relationship with a blacksmith’s anvil, while Stoker had the general build of a chap who’d be winded by a strong sonnet. The thing was a foregone conclusion, of course, and Stoker’s knuckles were duly introduced to the mahogany with a soft thud. But the rummy part was what happened next. Fitzherbert, the conquering hero, got a few polite nods, but young Stoker—the fellow who’d been comprehensively squashed—was suddenly the centre of a cheering mob. Blighters were patting his back, forcing brandy-and-sodas upon his person, and burbling about his "pluck." It was dashed peculiar; Fitzherbert had won the battle, no question about it, but a glance at his rather sour face told you he knew perfectly well he’d somehow managed to lose the war.
