It is a peculiar state of affairs, I must confess, when a fellow sets out on a simple railway journey with no grander ambition than to reach his destination without having his hat sat upon, and finds himself instead completely pipped at the post by the sort of sentiment he has always dodged with the agility of a nervous mongoose. The catalyst was a mix-up over a tea-trolley—a fairly cataclysmic affair involving a spilt beverage and a flying scone—which brought me into the orbit of a girl with a surprisingly logical mind and a laugh like tinkling bells. One would not have thought that a shared ordeal involving a stern-faced conductor and a dab of jam on one's waistcoat could lay the foundations for what the chaps who write novels call the tender passion. And yet, as she calmly explained why the company’s policy on pastry-related incidents was fundamentally flawed, a curious warmth began to suffuse the old frame. It was the sort of sensation that suggested my heretofore placid existence was about to become dashedly complicated, and, rummy as it seemed, the prospect struck me as absolutely first-rate.
