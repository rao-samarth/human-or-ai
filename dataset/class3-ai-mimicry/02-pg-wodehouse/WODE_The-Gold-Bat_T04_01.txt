I was ambling through the high street of Little Wimple-in-the-Marsh, contemplating a restorative pint, when I bumped squarely into Percy Fothergill, a chap I hadn't clapped eyes on since we were both battling algebra at St. Jude's. He immediately brought up that dashed awkward incident involving the Vicar's prize-winning marrow, and I had to put him right on a few points. I've always maintained that our actions on that front were grossly misunderstood by the powers that were. It wasn't, as the Headmaster so coldly suggested, a simple case of 'wanton hooliganism'. Far from it. A fellow from a rival house had cast a rather beastly aspersion on our dormitory's collective courage, and when a challenge like that is thrown down, one doesn't simply write a stiff letter to the editor. No, a gesture is required; a grand, symbolic act. The fact that the only available symbol was a twenty-pound vegetable and the act involved catapulting it through the window of the Botany classroom was merely a logistical detail. One has one's obligations, after all. To let such a slur pass would have been, well, simply not done.
