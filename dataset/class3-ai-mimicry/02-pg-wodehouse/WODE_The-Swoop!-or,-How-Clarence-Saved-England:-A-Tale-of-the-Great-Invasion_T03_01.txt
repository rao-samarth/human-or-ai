My dear chap, you simply wouldn't credit the state of things over here. Trying to navigate Piccadilly is like wading through treacle, only the treacle is made of human beings utterly lost to the world. And what, you ask, is the cause of this city-wide paralysis? Some momentous affair of state? A spot of bother in the Balkans? Not a bit of it. It’s all down to a dashed little paper puzzle called ‘Quad-Box’, a thing of grids and numbers that seems to have addled the collective intellect. I saw a portly bishop on the steps of his club, pencil trembling with fervour, completely ignoring a fellow of the cloth who was trying to ask him the time. Even the cabbies are at it, squinting at their little booklets between fares, causing the sort of traffic snarls that would make a seasoned explorer give up and go home. The whole nation, from peer to postman, has gone barmy over it, and a fellow can’t even get to his lunch without tripping over some cove deep in numerical contemplation. It’s all frightfully rum.
