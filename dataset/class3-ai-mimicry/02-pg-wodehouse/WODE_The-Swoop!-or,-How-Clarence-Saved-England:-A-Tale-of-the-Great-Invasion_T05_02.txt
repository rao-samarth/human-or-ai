I say, old man, you simply wouldn’t have credited the scene at Aunt Mildred’s luncheon on Tuesday, a proper shambles if ever there was one. The source of the agitation was her prize bulldog, Montgomery, who had somehow managed to get his head wedged firmly in the ornate cat-flap, a predicament which left his formidable back end thrashing about the vestibule like a loose cannon. Uncle Reginald, a man whose solution to most crises involves shouting, was making the poor brute’s ordeal considerably worse, while Cousin Bertram was suggesting we apply butter, a notion that seemed both impractical and deeply upsetting. The whole affair was reaching a frightful crescendo when who should sort out the muddle but young Algernon, the pallid nephew who collects ferns and is generally considered to be a bit of a wash-out. Without a word, he fetched a tin of sardines from the pantry, opened it with a quiet pop, and waved it under the bulldog’s nose. The animal, forgetting its troubles in a flash, gave one mighty, fish-inspired heave and shot out of the flap like a cork from a bottle. It just goes to show, what?
