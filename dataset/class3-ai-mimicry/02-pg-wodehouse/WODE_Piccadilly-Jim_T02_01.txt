My eye, as I took a restorative turn about the deck, was caught by the frightful contortions of young Percival Hemmingsworth in his dogged pursuit of Lady Agatha Cram. He was hovering about her deckchair like a particularly anxious bee that has misplaced its hive, laughing at jokes that hadn't even been properly launched and leaping to retrieve fallen knitting with the sort of high-octane zeal one usually reserves for rescuing damsels from burning buildings. It struck me as a rum sort of business, this whole enterprise of shinning up the social pole. One expends a fearful amount of energy, contorts the features into a rictus of bonhomie, and for what, precisely? To earn a nod from a dowager who, if you passed her in the street tomorrow, would likely peer through you as if you were a lightly-frosted windowpane. Honestly, it all seemed a lot of unnecessary exertion when a fellow could simply find a quiet corner with a detective story and a suitably refreshing beverage.
