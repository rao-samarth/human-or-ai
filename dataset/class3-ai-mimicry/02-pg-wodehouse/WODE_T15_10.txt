Young Barmy Fotheringay, who until recently had considered the strenuous lifting of a teacup his primary form of exercise, had suddenly discovered his life’s purpose at a bustling intersection just off the Strand. He’d taken to supplementing the efforts of the new electric traffic signals with a series of what he called 'interpretive hand gestures', convinced that the motorists required a more personal, human touch. Cabbies swerved, omnibuses honked, and pedestrians scattered like startled sparrows, but Barmy saw none of it; his entire being was focused on orchestrating the perfect, harmonious flow of conveyance. He was a man transformed, his face alight with a beatific glow as he conducted the magnificent, if largely imaginary, symphony of the crossroads. One couldn’t help but feel that, despite the odd near-miss with a delivery bicycle, the chap had never been happier. It was, I reflected, a rather splendid thing to see a fellow so thoroughly gripped by a wholesome, civic-minded passion.
