The train, having evidently decided it had seen enough of the French countryside, came to a shuddering halt that sent my valise crashing down upon a crate of what sounded suspiciously like chickens. The carriage erupted into a cacophony of squawks, indignant muttering, and the sort of high-pitched wail usually reserved for the discovery of a mouse in the soup. Amidst this rather trying state of affairs, I caught sight of the girl from the second-class compartment, Miss Pringle. While a formidable aunt of hers wrestled with a fallen birdcage, she was simply regarding the chaos with a look of serene amusement, as if the whole to-do were a jolly bit of theatre staged for her benefit. She caught my eye and offered a small, conspiratorial smile. “Bit of a sticky wicket, isn’t it?” she murmured over the din. It was then that a profound truth hit me with the force of a runaway omnibus: a girl who could smile like that while a hen was flapping about her ankles was, quite frankly, the only sort of girl a fellow ought to consider marrying.
