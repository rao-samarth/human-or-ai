It is a curious psychological phenomenon, often observed in quiet corners of the shires, how a single, seemingly trivial act of defiance can set a whole community alight. For years, the village of Upper Bimplington had endured the horticultural dictates of Major-General Sir Roderick Flitch, a man who believed that all garden gnomes ought to be painted a uniform battleship grey. His word, on this and other matters, was law. It fell to young Percy Pringle, a mild-mannered fellow whose chief ambition was to perfect a soufflé, to cast the first stone, as it were, by painting his personal gnome a rather cheerful and wholly non-regulation canary yellow. A hush fell upon the village green. Sir Roderick was seen to puff out his cheeks like a distressed pouter pigeon, but before he could erupt, old Mrs. Higgins had produced a pot of vermilion for her own gnome, and the tide had turned. By evensong, the place was a riot of colour, and the Major-General's grey tyranny was quite overthrown.
