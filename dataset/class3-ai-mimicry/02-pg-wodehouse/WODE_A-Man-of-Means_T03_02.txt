It was well past midnight, and the house was as silent as a chap who’s forgotten the punchline, when the solution came to me in a flash of what I can only describe as pure, unadulterated intellect. The guv’nor’s beastly little mechanical bird had stopped chirping, you see, a state of affairs that had cast a frightful gloom over the breakfast table for a solid week. I’d been tinkering with the dashed thing for an hour, poking its inner workings with a cocktail stick and what-not, when I happened to trip over the hearthrug—a rather regrettable rug, all tassels and ambush—and sent the contraption flying. It landed with a most unmusical thud, coughed up a stray collar-stud that had apparently been jamming its gizzard, and immediately burst into a song that sounded suspiciously like a sea shanty. A lesser man might call it a fluke, but I knew better; it was a simple case of applying kinetic force with calculated imprecision, a masterstroke of deductive engineering, if you will. A fellow really has to have his wits about him for this sort of thing.
