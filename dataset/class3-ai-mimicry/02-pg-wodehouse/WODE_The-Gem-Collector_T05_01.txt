There are moments in a fellow’s life, generally cropping up during some species of family conclave, when the soul begins to cry out for a bit of the old vim and vigour. As I sat wedged between a potted fern and my Great-Aunt Maude, who was holding forth on the subject of liniment, it struck me with considerable force that my existence was rather short on what you might call dramatic incident. The most perilous undertaking on the immediate horizon was the navigation of the tea-tray, a fraught business at the best of times, but hardly the sort of thing a chap writes home about. One reads of chaps scaling mountains or foiling conspiracies in far-flung locales, their days chock-a-block with brouhaha and derring-do. Meanwhile, my own personal Everest was the challenge of avoiding a second helping of my aunt’s notoriously leaden scones. It was, I reflected, a bit of a swizz.
