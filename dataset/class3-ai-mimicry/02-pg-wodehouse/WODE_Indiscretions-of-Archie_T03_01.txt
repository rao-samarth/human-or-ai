Freddie found himself wrestling with the old conscience, a bout for which he felt distinctly out of training and which was causing a nearby matron to peer at him with frank disapproval over her teacake. "But Binky, old man," he urged, his voice a low thrum of agony, "the whole enterprise has a certain flavour, don't you know. A bit off. One can't simply go about persuading perfectly sound chaps that their prize-winning roses require daily serenades from a string quartet—not for a fee, at any rate." Binky, a practical soul who regarded moral quandaries as a form of unnecessary exercise, merely shrugged. "The stipend, Freddie, the stipend. Think of it." And Freddie did think of it; he pictured a life free from vexing tailors' bills, a life of plenty. Yet, on the other hand, he pictured the stern, disappointed face of a prize-winning rose, wilting not from neglect, but from the sheer shame of it all. It was a dashed tricky spot for a fellow to be in.
