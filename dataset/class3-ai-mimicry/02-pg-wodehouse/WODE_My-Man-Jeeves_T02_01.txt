It is an odd business, and one I have often pondered while reclining in a deckchair on some sun-drenched lawn, how a certain species of gentleman, blessed with a fortune that renders the concept of a hard day’s work a mere literary curiosity, will go to extraordinary lengths to invent his own troubles. Take my host, Sir Reginald, a man who had not so much as buttered his own toast since leaving the nursery. He spent the entire morning in a state of high dudgeon, pacing the gravel and gesticulating wildly, not over some impending financial crisis, but because his prize-winning goose had apparently developed a ‘disrespectful honk’. One might suppose that a life unburdened by genuine strife would lead to a placid, zen-like calm; instead, it seems merely to create a vacuum which the mind, despising a void, feels compelled to fill with the most Grade-A, top-hole nonsense it can concoct.
