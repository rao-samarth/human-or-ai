The matter of the misfiled Bingleton dossier had reached a point of particular crispness, with old Mr Abernathy’s steely gaze—a thing of ice and chisels—fixed firmly upon young Cuthbert Finchley. Cuthbert, for his part, felt a bit like a rabbit who, having popped up for a breath of fresh air, finds himself the sole focus of a convention of stoats. He knew, with the ghastly certainty that accompanies such moments, that the true architect of this administrative calamity was not himself but young Percival Simmons, who was at that very moment doing a passable imitation of a blancmange caught in a high wind. To speak up would be to cast poor Percy, already skating on the thinnest of professional ice, directly into the outer darkness; to remain silent, however, meant allowing his own meticulously polished standing within the firm to be tarnished beyond all recognition. A chap’s good name, he reflected grimly, was a fragile bauble. And so, squaring his narrow shoulders, he met Abernathy’s glare and meekly accepted the verbal lashing, choosing the role of hapless bungler over that of the common snitch.
