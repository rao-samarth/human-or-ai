It strikes a fellow, you know, particularly when rattling along in one of these continental expresses where the very upholstery seems to frown upon frivolity, that there exists a certain cosmic equilibrium to be maintained. One observes, for instance, a gentleman in the corridor whose moustaches alone are sufficient to curdle milk at twenty paces—a man so steeped in his own consequence that he practically sloshes. In such moments, one feels a higher calling, an almost spiritual nudge, to perform some small service for the universe, such as the swift and imperceptible transposition of the luggage tags on his portmanteau and that of the unassuming little curate opposite. It isn't malice, you understand; far from it. It is merely a gentle corrective, a reminder from the unseen powers that a chap who looks like a Roman emperor condemning a gladiator to the lions ought not to be entirely sure that his spare spats will end up in Nice rather than Novosibirsk. It simply restores the proper order of things, what?
