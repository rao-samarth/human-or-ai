It is a peculiar feature of the human biped, I have often found myself reflecting—usually at some ungodly hour when the house is as silent as a locked library—that a life of placid contentment is a thing he will actively flee from. You would think, what, that a chap who has secured a comfortable chair, a decent supply of tobacco, and a reasonable certainty that no one will be presenting him with a bill before breakfast would be as happy as a clam at high tide. And yet, there is this odd, twitchy instinct to go and poke the sleeping lion, as it were; to see if the placid waters can’t be stirred up into something a bit more bracing, like a tidal wave. The quiet life, you see, is all well and good in theory, but some internal engine seems to demand a spot of bother, a soupçon of peril, a definite risk of landing oneself squarely in the consommé. It's a dashed rum business, and one that has been responsible for more hasty departures through french windows than all the jealous husbands in Surrey.
