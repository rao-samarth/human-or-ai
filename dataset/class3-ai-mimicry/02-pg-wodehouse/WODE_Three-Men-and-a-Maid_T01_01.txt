It became clear to even the most modestly-furnished intellect that a spot of deft manoeuvring was required if I was to have a word with Penelope. She was shimmering near the potted ferns, you see, but the route was guarded by her Aunt Agatha, a woman who possessed the warm, approachable charm of a customs official suspecting contraband. My strategy, conceived in a flash of pure genius, was to create a diversion involving a spilled cocktail and a feigned apology—a classic, yes, but effective. I began my approach, moving with what I felt was the lithe stealth of a leopard, only to find my path blocked by young Bertram, who chose that precise moment to launch into a dreadfully dull story about his new motor-car. The upshot was that by the time I’d disengaged myself, Penelope had been cornered by that ghastly chap with the monocle, and all my brilliant scheming had resulted in was me standing alone by the cheese straws, a broken man.
