It has often struck a thinking man, when observing the goings-on in a place like Little Wibbley-on-the-Marsh, that the intricate and frequently ill-advised stratagems of the young are less a sign of a depraved character and more a sort of cosmic balancing act, rather like a dose of salts for the village constitution. Without the occasional purloined policeman's helmet or the sudden appearance of a goat in the organ loft, the civic soul would, I suspect, simply ossify, congealing into a dreary sort of torpor. The elders, you see, require a periodic jolt to remind them that life is not merely a matter of parish council meetings and the proper cultivation of prize-winning marrows; it is a vibrant, chaotic affair, and the local lads, with their convoluted plots involving string, treacle, and a surprising amount of impromptu engineering, are simply the appointed agents of this universal truth, sent to keep the arteries of the community from hardening. It’s all frightfully necessary, when you stop and think about it.
