The whole ghastly mix-up, Freddie realised as a stout constable began to take a more than professional interest in the proceedings, stemmed from a single, ill-advised shout across a bustling thoroughfare. He had been tasked by his Aunt Agatha with a simple mission: locate a certain Wilberforce, a chap with a face like a troubled pudding, and instruct him to "fetch the hat." A simple enough charge, you might think, but in the general din of traffic and whatnot, what Freddie had actually bellowed was something that sounded suspiciously like "ditch the cat." Wilberforce, a man of nervous disposition who happened to be transporting his prize-winning Persian in a wicker basket, took this as a direct and rather sinister command from some unknown underworld kingpin. The ensuing panic, which saw the basket launched into the arms of a startled bishop and the cat making a new home in the man’s mitre, was a thing of beauty if you liked that sort of thing. Freddie, however, did not. He just wanted the ground to open up and offer a chap a bit of blessed peace and quiet.
