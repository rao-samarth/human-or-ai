Mulling it over in the wee, small hours, with only the hoot of a distant owl for company, it strikes a chap as dashed peculiar that the most important regulations governing one's conduct—the sort of thing that separates the true pal from the absolute rotter—are the very ones nobody ever bothers to write down. You won't find them in any school handbook, not sandwiched between ‘Regulation 8: No Unauthorised Feasting’ and ‘Regulation 9: All Tacks to be Removed from Master's Chair.’ No, this is a deeper, more fundamental sort of law. It's the silent understanding that you take the blame for the broken window, you create a diversion when old Biffy is climbing back through the dormer, and you absolutely, under any circumstances, never, ever reveal that the Headmaster’s prize-winning roses were fertilised with your aunt’s particularly potent sherry. These aren't mere suggestions; they are the iron-clad pillars upon which civilisation, or at least the reasonably chummy coexistence of fellows, is built. A chap just knows.
