It seemed to young Reginald a scheme of the most cunning and water-tight construction, the sort of masterly ruse one hatches after a particularly good breakfast. The objective was simple: to prise a fiver from his Aunt Agatha, a woman who parted with cash with the same cheerfulness a limpet shows when being introduced to a crowbar. His plan, therefore, was to feign a sudden and overwhelming passion for the study of mosses, a dreary subject upon which his aunt was a noted, and frankly rather tedious, authority. He began by sighing soulfully over a patch of the green stuff on the garden wall, remarking on its intricate beauty, only to see the old dear’s eye gleam with a terrifying, fanatical light. Before Reginald could so much as mention the need for a new magnifying glass, she had seized his arm, declared him a kindred spirit, and was steering him towards the library for a two-hour lecture on the reproductive cycle of the Sphagnum cristatum. It was, he reflected glumly, a stiff price to pay.
