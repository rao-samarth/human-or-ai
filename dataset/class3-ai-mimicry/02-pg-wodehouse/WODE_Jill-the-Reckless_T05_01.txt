It is, I have often found myself reflecting at these formal gatherings, a profound error to take a fellow entirely at his face value—especially when the face in question belongs to a man like Sir Roderick Plumley, who currently resembles a benevolent walrus that has just been tipped off to a particularly succulent herring. One sees the gleaming monocle and hears the booming laugh that makes the chandeliers tremble, and one promptly ticks him off in the old mental ledger as a top-hole specimen of the hearty, no-nonsense squire. Yet, a deeper acquaintance reveals a soul so utterly devoted to the collection of miniature porcelain frogs that he would cheerfully bilk his own grandmother out of her last shilling for a rare speckled model from Upper Silesia. The glossy exterior, you see, is frequently little more than a cunning bit of window-dressing, designed to distract the casual observer while the real, and often rather rum, business of the establishment is conducted quietly inside.
