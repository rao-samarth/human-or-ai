I was lodging these sentiments aloud over a pot of what passed for tea in this rather grim establishment—a place where the scones seemed to have been designed by a committee of pessimists—when my companion, young Barmy Fotheringay, clapped me on the shoulder with a force that nearly sent my crumpet airborne. "Chin up, old horse!" he boomed, with a grin that could have melted glaciers. Now, Barmy is one of those chaps who, if you chucked him into the middle of a Siberian winter with nothing but a pair of spats, would immediately start organizing a tobogganing party and betting on the fastest icicle. The day was a study in grey misery, the sort that makes you want to curl up with a good book and not uncurl until May, yet here he was, beaming like a lighthouse, completely impervious. A nearby cove, who had been morosely inspecting his teacup as if it owed him money, actually flinched at the sheer voltage of Barmy’s good cheer. It’s a rummy thing, but when you have a pal like that, even the most frightful Tuesday starts to look a bit more rosy around the gills.
