I must confess, sir, that when word got out that old Mr. Pringle had come into his rather spectacular inheritance, it was as if someone had sounded a gong for every species of bounder and enterprising cove within a fifty-mile radius. The front office, usually a tranquil sea of potted ferns and hushed reverence, suddenly took on the aspect of a particularly boisterous market day, with chaps touting everything from self-darning socks to shares in dubious Patagonian pickle farms. And while I grant you that allowing the fellow with the patent non-squeak shoehorn to get as far as your inner sanctum was, in retrospect, a bit of a bloomer, I ask you to consider the man’s sheer plausibility. He had an eye that glittered with sincerity, a moustache that simply cried out for trust, and a sob story concerning a widowed aunt that would have made a statue weep. One is hardly steeled for that sort of frontal assault before one has even had one’s morning cup of tea.
