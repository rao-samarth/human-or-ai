It is all very well for the chaps who write improving books to warble on about the soul’s fortitude, but as I rattled through the French countryside, it struck me that the genuine article rarely announces itself with a flourish of trumpets. No, the real stuff, the inner grit that separates the men from the mice, is far more likely to be demonstrated in some minor, unheralded skirmish. I’ve always held that the true test of a fellow’s spine isn’t found when facing down a charging bison—a thing one so seldom has to do—but in the smaller, stickier wickets, such as resolving to order lunch in a language one has only recently been introduced to via a slim pamphlet. The potential for making a complete hash of it is enormous, of course, and the waiter had the look of a man who had judged and condemned lesser mortals for far smaller crimes. And yet, one must have a dash at it. One must simply square the shoulders and plunge ahead, for if a chap shrinks from the prospect of mangling a request for *pot-au-feu*, what hope has he when life lobs a truly tricky googly his way?
