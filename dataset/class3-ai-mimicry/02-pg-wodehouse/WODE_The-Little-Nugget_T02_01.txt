Young Cuthbert, my sister Agatha’s pride and joy, was currently demonstrating what she called ‘letting him find his own boundaries’ by attempting to teach the cat to play the ukulele. The cat, a stout creature of firm principles and a short temper, was not a willing pupil, and its opinion was being expressed in a series of noises that would have made a hyena wince. I had suggested, in a mild sort of way, that a chap’s boundaries might reasonably be drawn somewhere short of armed conflict with the household pets, but Agatha had simply smiled that serene, maddening smile of hers. She held the rum notion that to thwart the little blighter’s creative impulses would inflict some frightful, deep-seated harm upon his delicate psyche. The net result, of course, was that while Cuthbert’s psyche remained spectacularly un-dented, the cat’s was in tatters, the ukulele was a write-off, and my afternoon snooze was quite off the table.
