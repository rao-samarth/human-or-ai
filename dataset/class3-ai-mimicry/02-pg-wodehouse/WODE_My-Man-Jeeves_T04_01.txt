There is, I've always maintained, nothing quite like the clickety-clack of a continental express to soothe a spirit that has recently been put through the wringer. A fellow sits back, watches the French scenery whizz by like a particularly speedy panorama, and finds the whole beastly affair involving Honoria and her insistence on daily poetry readings beginning to fade like a cheap suit in a downpour. It's a curious thing, really; one moment you're convinced the heart has been shattered into a thousand irreparable pieces, the next you're contemplating the luncheon menu with the keen enthusiasm of a schoolboy spotting a tuck-box. It just goes to show that while the path of true love may be strewn with the emotional equivalent of banana skins, the sun always pops its head out eventually, dries the pavement, and reminds a chap that there's always a rather topping new horizon just around the bend.
