It has always been a source of quiet, scientific interest to me, this business of the fellow who, by virtue of having paid the gas bill, assumes a sort of divine right over the household’s minor affairs. One observes him, for instance, laying down the law on the precise angle at which a teacup must be placed upon its saucer, and one can’t help but marvel at the sheer, unadulterated pepper in the man’s soul. There he goes now, padding about the darkened hallway in a dressing-gown that has seen better days, his expression that of a Roman emperor inspecting the aqueducts, all because he suspects someone has left a biscuit crumb on the conservatory floor. The truly rummy part is the absolute conviction behind it; the unwavering belief that the universe itself would wobble on its axis if his edicts were ignored. It is a performance of immense gravity, this midnight patrol, yet its purpose is so magnificently trivial that one feels less like a cowed subordinate and more like a naturalist observing a particularly pompous species of beetle.
