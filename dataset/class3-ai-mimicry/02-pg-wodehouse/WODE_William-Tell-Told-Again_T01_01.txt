I found myself, late in the evening with the embers doing their bit in the grate, pondering the singularly rum business of dealing with the Big Cheese who has gone off the rails. You know the sort of cove: starts off reasonably enough, but before you can say ‘pip-pip,’ he’s commandeered all the best armchairs, put a tax on breathing, and generally made himself a thorough-going nuisance. Now, the question that presents itself to the thoughtful man is what prompts the ordinary specimen to rise up and give the blighter the old heave-ho. Is it some lofty, soul-stirring love of liberty one reads about in books? Or is it, as I suspect, more akin to the simple, elemental fury one feels upon discovering that someone has snaffled the last of the marmalade? It seems to me that the whole grand affair, when you boil it down, is less about high-flown principles and more about the fundamental human right not to be perpetually annoyed. It’s a sticky wicket, no doubt, but one must play one’s stroke.
