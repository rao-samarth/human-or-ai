Until that Tuesday, Bertie had considered the village of Pipsley-on-the-Wold a location designed principally for the cultivation of mud and melancholia, a sentiment that deepened considerably upon finding himself shin-deep in the former while attempting to retrieve his hat from a particularly malevolent thorn bush. It was a moment of profound spiritual crisis; the soul felt bruised, the trousers were a write-off, and a cold drizzle was beginning to make its intentions known. He was, in short, at his lowest ebb. It was then that a voice, clear as a bell and twice as cheering, remarked, "That's a proper pickle you're in." He looked up to see a girl with eyes the colour of a summer sky and a smile that seemed to single-handedly take issue with the prevailing gloom. She extended a hand, not to help, but to offer him a biscuit from a small paper bag. And as he took the biscuit, a simple digestive, something rearranged itself within Bertie’s heart with a distinct and seismic jolt, suggesting that Pipsley-on-the-Wold might, against all available evidence, contain the very secret of human happiness.
