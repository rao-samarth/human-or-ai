I know what you’re thinking, Agatha, and I concede that a nephew discovered at three in the morning, looking for all the world like a drowned marmot that has recently had a dalliance with a coal scuttle, is not a sight to gladden the maternal—or, in your case, auntly—heart. But before you reach for the smelling salts and the family solicitor, you must understand my position. Until this evening, I was a listless bauble, a mere puff of smoke in a tweed jacket, my sole daily quandary being whether to brave the kippers or stick to the safer ground of toast and marmalade. Life, in short, was a bit of a pallid wash. And then—whoosh!—the downstairs cistern elected to give up the ghost with the sort of dramatic finality one usually associates with the final act of an opera. It was a crisis, a proper deluge, and as I waded into the fray with a bucket and a distinctly inadequate sponge, a strange new feeling took hold. I was no longer a decorative accessory; I was a man with a mission, a bulwark against the tide, and frankly, I haven't felt so alive since Pilkington minor put the frog in the headmaster's inkwell.
