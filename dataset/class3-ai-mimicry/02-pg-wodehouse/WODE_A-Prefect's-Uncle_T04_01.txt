My dear chap, you must understand that the matter is entirely out of my hands. When a fellow gives his solemn word, particularly to a female relative with the disposition of a hornet and the memory of an elephant, he can't simply wriggle out of it like a worm on a hook. It simply isn't done. I admit, the prospect of smuggling my Aunt Penelope’s prize-winning Pekinese—a creature I have long suspected of being a malevolent spirit in a fur coat—across the channel in a hatbox is not one I relish; in fact, the very thought turns the blood to a sort of chilled consommé. But the promise was made, and a Higginbotham, for all his other failings, does not go back on his plighted troth. It is the bedrock, the very foundation, upon which our otherwise rickety family name is built. So you see, my hands are tied, and I shall require the loan of your largest and most breathable topper.
