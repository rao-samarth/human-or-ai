As the French countryside whizzed by the carriage window, a chap couldn't help but ponder the rummy business of the human heart. Take young Boffo, for instance. The family had him all but shackled to the daughter of some frightful steel magnate—a girl with a face like a suet pudding and the conversational skills of a reserved halibut—when, dash it all, he ups and elopes with a lass who juggled for a living. The aunts, of course, have been having fifty-seven varieties of apoplectic fit, and I’ve received no fewer than three telegrams demanding I 'talk sense' into the blighter. But frankly, I haven't the heart for it. I saw Boffo just before he legged it, and the poor fish looked positively incandescent with bliss, a sight you’d never get if his future consisted of discussing tariffs over the breakfast marmalade. It does make one think that perhaps chucking the whole ghastly rulebook into the nearest ditch is precisely the ticket, what?
