The senior partner, a Mr. Bivens, whose jowls suggested a long and mournful acquaintance with gravity, loomed over my desk and decanted the sort of task that curdles the very soul—the quarterly review of inter-departmental invoicing protocols. A sticky wicket, if ever there was one, and the sort of thing that could blot out the sunshine for a fortnight. A direct refusal, of course, was out of the question; it simply isn't done. Instead, I gave the old bean a glittering smile and assured him I was his man, absolutely, but that to do the job properly, one must first holistically re-contextualise the core data streams. It would be imperative, I explained, to conduct a preliminary meta-analysis of the pre-existing procedural paradigms to establish a baseline for proactive synergy. Bivens, who had likely just wanted a simple list with numbers on it, blinked rather like a toad surprised by a sudden sunbeam. He made a soft, gurgling sound, muttered something about ‘circling back on that’, and oozed away, leaving the invoicing protocols to fester in peace for another day.
