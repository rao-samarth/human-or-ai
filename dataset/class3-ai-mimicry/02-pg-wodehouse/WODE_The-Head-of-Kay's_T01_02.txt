Look here, Headmaster, I'm not the sort of chap to go about introducing gastropods into another fellow's prize-winning vegetable as a general rule; it simply isn't done. But you must appreciate the circumstances. A Southwood man had been observed, not ten days prior, applying a rather noxious-smelling fertilizer to our Head of House’s petunias—an act which, in the delicate political climate of St. Crispin’s, was tantamount to a declaration of war. What, then, was a loyal Northwoodian to do? We couldn’t very well let the slur stand. It became a matter of honour, a question of preserving the very fabric of our establishment against these frightful bounders. The marrow, a truly magnificent specimen destined for glory at the village fête, presented itself as the only logical, indeed the only gentlemanly, theatre for our rebuttal. It was a regrettable necessity, you see, but a necessity all the same.
