You see, my dearest Cynthia, the entire affair is in what you might call a state of advanced stickiness. When a fellow gives his word—particularly when he gives it to a formidable aunt who holds the purse strings and has a glare that could curdle milk at fifty paces—he is, to put it frankly, in the soup. It isn’t that I don’t think Beatrice a perfectly splendid girl; she’s as solid as the Bank of England and has a laugh like a friendly retriever fetching a stick. But one’s heart, you know, is a rummy sort of cove, and it pays absolutely no attention to binding agreements made over tea and seed-cake. It has, in short, toddled off in your direction and refuses to come to heel. And so I find myself caught, a wretched fly in the amber of familial obligation, when all I want is to buzz off with you to some quiet corner of the map. What, I ask you, is a poor blighter to do when his sworn duty points one way and his entire soul has packed its bags and is trying to hail a taxi in the other?
