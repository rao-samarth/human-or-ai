The telegram had arrived with the breakfast kipper at Crewe, and its contents had rather taken the gaiety out of the morning marmalade. My formidable Aunt Dahlia, it seemed, had conceived a sudden and imperative need for my presence at Biddle-on-the-Wold to vet the floral arrangements for the vicar’s garden party. To a fellow whose soul was soaring towards a week of unadulterated golf with Freddie Finch, the summons came as a bit of a stinker. I mean, what to do? A simple fib—a sprained ankle, say, or a sudden bout of the pip—was one thing, but to ignore the imperial command entirely was to skate on the thinnest of ice over the deepest of ponds. One false move, and the quarterly allowance, that beautiful, life-giving stream of cash, would be frozen at its source. It was a straight choice between a future of blighted servitude under the ancestral roof and a glorious, sunlit liberty fraught with the distinct peril of having to earn one's own bread and butter. A proper braintwister, if ever there was one.
