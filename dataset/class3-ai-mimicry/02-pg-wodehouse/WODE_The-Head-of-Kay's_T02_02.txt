I was trying to give my full attention to a rather superior crumpet in a quiet little tea-and-bun shop when a bit of a barney kicked off at the next table, spoiling the whole mood. A whiskery old cove, the sort who looks as though he was born in a stiff collar and probably chairs a committee for the preservation of something frightfully important, was taking exception to a bright young thing with hair that defied gravity. Apparently, the lad had propped his feet up on an empty chair, a crime which, in the old boy’s view, ranked somewhere between high treason and using the wrong fork for the fish. The youngster, instead of apologising profusely and slinking away, simply gazed at the ceiling and began to whistle a jaunty tune. It’s always a rum business when the chaps with the rulebooks collide with the chaps who use the rulebooks for kindling; it never seems to end with handshakes and mutual respect, but rather with a good deal of spluttering and a distinct chill in the air.
