"It's a frightful bind, Freddie, an absolutely frightful bind," boomed Uncle Hubert, sloshing a bit of port onto a priceless rug. He resembled, at that moment, a benevolent walrus that had just been served a bad oyster. "One hires a fellow to manage the investments, you see. Sound chap. But then the fellow needs a staff, and his staff needs an office with a view, and before you can say ‘quarterly dividends,’ you're hiring another chap—a sort of super-comptroller—just to keep an eye on the first chap’s chaps! It's an absolute pyramid of salaried coves, and I'm at the bottom, footing the bally bill for the whole dashed structure. My man, Pringle, now tells me the super-comptroller is suggesting an advisory committee to oversee *him*. Where does it end, I ask you? It's enough to make a fellow chuck it all and go live in a shed." Aunt Dahlia merely sighed and began dabbing at the port stain with a napkin, a manoeuvre she had perfected over forty years of marriage.
