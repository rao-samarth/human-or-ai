Of course, I said, addressing the formidable set of my Uncle’s shoulders, it’s not the base allegation of having snaffled the silver butter-dish that truly stings the soul. A chap can weather that sort of thing. What really puts the lid on it, what truly makes a fellow’s blood simmer, is the ghastly implication that I possess the sort of Machiavellian intellect required for the job. It presupposes a level of strategic cunning which, as you’ve frequently noted, I have spent a lifetime studiously avoiding. Honestly, this whole business of trying to establish one’s spotlessness to a tribunal that has already polished the black cap feels rather like attempting to explain the offside rule to a particularly stubborn garden gnome; one’s points are met with a stony silence and an unnerving, glassy stare.
