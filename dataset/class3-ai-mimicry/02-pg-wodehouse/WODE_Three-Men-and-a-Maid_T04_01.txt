The air in the drawing-room at Pellingham Manor was thick with a low-grade, simmering panic, the kind you get when the chef has used the wrong sort of parsley in the garnish. Aunt Millicent—not the good one, the other one—had cornered poor Freddie by the potted ferns, her expression that of a basilisk who has just witnessed a catastrophic breach in cocktail-hour etiquette. The cause of the disturbance, it transpired, was that the new footman had a tendency to breathe audibly through his mouth, a state of affairs she considered a direct and personal affront. Freddie, for his part, was scarcely listening; his entire soul was consumed by the ghastly realisation that his left trouser-crease had lost its razor-sharp integrity sometime after the salmon mousse. Between the sibilant footman and the flaccid trouser-crease, it was a wonder the very foundations of the house didn't give way under the sheer, unadulterated strain of it all. The elder Pellingham simply stared into the middle distance, his world rocked by the frightful news that his best hybrid tea rose had been classified as merely ‘commendable’ at the village fete.
