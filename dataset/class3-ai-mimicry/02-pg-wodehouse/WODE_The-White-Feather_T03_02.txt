One is constantly told, usually by aunts with improving literature to hand, that a firm chin and a steady eye are the hallmarks of a chap who can look a charging rhinoceros in the face without so much as a blink. Take that stout blighter by the luggage trolley, for instance. To the casual observer, he was all granite and purpose, a man who undoubtedly wrestled bears for sport before breakfast. And yet, what was the actual state of play? A simple miscommunication with a porter—a mere trifle concerning the whereabouts of a hat-box—had reduced this titan of commerce to a quivering jelly. His commanding baritone had become a sort of squeak, his face had taken on the particular shade of puce one associates with badly boiled beetroot, and he was flapping his hands about like a penguin trying to take flight. It just goes to show you that a man’s backbone is often constructed of far less stern stuff than his jawbone, a fact the rhinoceros probably knows perfectly well.
