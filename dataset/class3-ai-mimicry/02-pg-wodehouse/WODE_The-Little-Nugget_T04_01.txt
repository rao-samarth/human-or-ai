I suppose, if you were to press me on the matter—and I see by your grim expression that you jolly well intend to—the exact moment the entire apple-cart went sideways was when the Dowager Marchioness’s toupée took flight, propelled by a sneeze of cyclonic proportions from old Fitzwilliam. The thing landed squarely in the trifle, a rather ghastly sight, precipitating a species of social Armageddon. Assorted shrieks rent the air, butlers staggered as if struck by lightning, and my Cousin Edgar chose this precise instant to begin a spirited lecture on the failings of the silver standard. It was, in short, a first-class shambles. Yet, it was then, as I cast a wild eye about for the nearest exit, that I saw her. She wasn’t shrieking or lecturing; she was merely watching the toupée sink into the custard with a small, amused smile, and I confess, something inside me went ‘thwump’. It was a sensation not unlike being coshed by a velvet-wrapped blackjack, and I knew, with a certainty that defied all logic, that the game was up.
