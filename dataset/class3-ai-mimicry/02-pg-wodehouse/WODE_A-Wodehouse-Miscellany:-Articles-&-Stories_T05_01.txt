The Vicar, a good man but one whose jaw tended to set like cement when confronted with what he considered parishioner laxity, cornered me by the petunias. He had the air of a prosecuting counsel who has just spotted the defendant attempting to tiptoe from the courtroom, and his gaze was distinctly bleak. It transpired that my donation of a slightly chipped ceramic birdbath to the annual church fête had caused the sort of subterranean rumblings that precede a volcano. Apparently, Mrs Higgins, she of the prize-winning dahlias and a temperament to match, had earmarked that precise spot for her jam stall. "My dear boy," the Vicar began, his voice a low thrum of sorrowful accusation, "one cannot simply deposit a birdbath—chipped or otherwise—willy-nilly. It upsets the entire ecosystem of the fête. It is, if I may be so bold, an act of pure, unadulterated chaos." I shuffled my feet, feeling that to be branded an agent of chaos over a bit of pottery was coming it a bit strong, even for a Tuesday.
