It was at my cousin Agatha’s rather starchy engagement party that I witnessed what you might call a meeting of two worlds, and a fairly bumpy meeting at that. Her fiancé’s uncle, a stout party from the shires named Geoffrey, had cornered a sleek young fellow from the City whose hair appeared to have been permanently shellacked into place. Geoffrey, with the earnest glow of a man explaining a profound truth, was detailing the only proper method for discouraging a fox from one’s hen-house, a method involving, if I heard correctly, a gramophone and a series of loud sea shanties. The City chap, who plainly believed a fox was something one only saw draped over a lady’s shoulders, wore the glazed expression of one listening to a lecture on advanced trigonometry in a foreign tongue. When Geoffrey concluded with a hearty, “Works a treat, eh? Better than any of your new-fangled alarms!”, the young man merely nodded faintly, looking as if he were in dire need of a stiff restorative and a swift taxi back to a world where the only predators were on the stock exchange.
