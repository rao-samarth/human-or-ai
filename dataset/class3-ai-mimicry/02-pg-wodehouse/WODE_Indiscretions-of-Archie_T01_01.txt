The peace of the afternoon, a rather decent and well-behaved sort of peace involving drifting clouds and the gentle snoozing of one’s uncle in a deckchair, was suddenly torpedoed by the arrival of young Chester F. Biddlesworth, a cousin recently imported from the United States. Where a normal cove might amble, Chester seemed to operate on some sort of internal combustion engine, zipping across the lawn with a sheaf of papers and a look of fearsome purpose. He stopped short by the petunias, barking into a wireless telephone about leveraging assets and maximising quarterly outputs, a stream of verbiage that sounded utterly unhinged to a chap whose chief ambition for the day was to see if Cook had made any of those little cucumber sandwiches. It was as if a typhoon had decided to take up residence in the herbaceous border, and a particularly noisy, business-minded typhoon at that. One could only blink, adjust one’s tie, and hope he didn’t try to syndicate the sundial.
