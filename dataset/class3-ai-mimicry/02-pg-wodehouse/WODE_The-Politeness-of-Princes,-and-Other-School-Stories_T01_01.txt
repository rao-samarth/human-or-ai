It’s a rummy thing, the way the sight of a certain sort of cove can instantly curdle the claret and turn an otherwise perfectly acceptable evening into a species of purgatory. There, across the sea of boiled shirt-fronts, was Reginald Pilbeam, looking just as smug as he had the day he’d beaten me to the scripture prize by a single, measly point—a point awarded, I still maintain, for his wholly insincere essay on the virtues of humility. The man was a positive blot, a human poison-ivy, and seeing him now, lapping up some anecdote from a stout party with a monocle, brought it all rushing back. One’s entire school career, it seemed in retrospect, had been a long and bitter struggle against the forces of Pilbeam, a constant battle of wits and wiles where the blighter always seemed to emerge, smirking, with the silver cup. It was enough to make a chap forswear formal dinners altogether.
