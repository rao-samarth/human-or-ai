It was during that rather trying railway journey between Calais and Monte Carlo, with nothing to gaze upon but Frenchmen gesticulating over their lunch-baskets, that my cousin Marmaduke was visited by one of those flashes of inspiration which so frequently land the instigator in the soup. His eye had fallen upon a portly gentleman opposite, a fellow whose walrus moustache and general air of disapproving of the universe simply cried out for a spot of what Marmaduke called 'psychic disturbance'. The general idea, you see, was to attach a pocket-handkerchief to a length of string, dangle it just out of the blighter’s line of sight, and give it the occasional ghostly wobble, thereby introducing a little spectral interest into his otherwise drab existence. The initial stages went off like a dream, with the moustache twitching in a most satisfactory manner, until the string, with a malevolence one rarely sees in inanimate objects, chose to snag itself firmly upon the emergency communication cord. There followed a frightful screeching of brakes, a flurry of agitated guards, and a general impression that Marmaduke’s career as a practical joker was, for the foreseeable future, at a bit of a dead end.
