My dear Cuthbert, you’ll be relieved to hear the Great Marrow Crisis has been averted, and young Boffo is no longer contemplating a sudden flit to the colonies. His scheme, you’ll recall, was to win the village fete’s vegetable competition, thereby impressing his formidable Aunt Agatha into stumping up the cash for his latest harebrained venture involving self-peeling bananas. The snag, of course, was that Boffo knows as much about horticulture as a parrot knows of Euclid, and his prize specimen had achieved the size and general aspect of a rather dispirited gherkin. Things looked bleak, I can tell you. It was then, just as the poor blighter was about to throw in the towel, that I was struck by a flash of pure, unadulterated genius. A quick trip to old Higgins’s farm, a discreet transaction involving a truly gargantuan squash destined for pig-feed, and a bit of judiciously applied mud—well, the thing was a walkover. The judges were agog, Aunt Agatha was floored, and Boffo is now the proud, if slightly fraudulent, holder of a small silver cup. It just goes to show, old man, that where boneheaded optimism fails, a little bit of grey matter, properly applied, can work absolute wonders.
