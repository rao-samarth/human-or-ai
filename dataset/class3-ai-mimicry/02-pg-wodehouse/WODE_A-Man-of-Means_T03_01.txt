It was one of those soft, grey evenings in the country when the world seems to hold its breath, and a fellow, if he’s of a ruminating disposition, can’t help but take stock. From my wicker chair I surveyed the placid duck pond and the orderly rose bushes, all of it somehow mine, and felt the familiar sense of bafflement descend. I tried, as I often did, to trace the chain of events that had led a chap of my distinctly limited wattage from a state of general penury to this rather agreeable conclusion, but the links were nowhere to be found. The whole business had the air of a complex mathematical equation that, through some cosmic error in addition, had produced a simple, happy result. One felt less like the architect of one’s fortune and more like a pleasantly surprised passenger who, having boarded a train bound for a bleak industrial town, finds he has arrived instead at a sunny seaside resort, with no clear idea of how the driver managed to get so comprehensively lost.
