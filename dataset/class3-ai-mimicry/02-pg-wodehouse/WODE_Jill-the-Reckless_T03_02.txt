It was at the precise moment our express to Brighton drew level with the down-train to Chichester that my cousin Augustus, a chap whose brain-pan generally contained little more than fluff and the odd sporting result, announced his intention of effecting a transfer. He had, it seemed, spotted a Pekinese in the opposite carriage that looked 'a bit down in the mouth,' and felt it his solemn duty as a gentleman to offer it a slice of his Battenberg cake. I had just opened my mouth to point out several salient flaws in his logic—not least of which being the twenty-foot drop and the distinct possibility of becoming jam on the Sussex countryside—when he was gone. With a cheerful 'Toodle-oo!' and a flash of plus-fours, he simply launched himself into the void, a man who, when confronted with a chasm between common sense and a dashed silly impulse, invariably chose to take a running jump. He was, in short, the sort of cove for whom a half-baked plan was always infinitely superior to no plan at all.
