It was one of those evenings that make a chap question the fundamental benevolence of the universe, with the pater's eye fixed upon me from across the conservatory like a lighthouse beacon warning ships off a particularly rocky bit of coast. I was, to put it frankly, corked. Pinned down. He had that firm, resolute set to the jaw which meant he'd received his marching orders from the mater and intended to see that I didn't so much as sidle towards the French windows for a breath of air. The situation looked bleak, I grant you, until old Biffy Biddlesham cornered my esteemed parent and launched into the opening stanzas of his celebrated anecdote about the faulty carburettor. A notoriously long and winding narrative, it afforded precisely the sliver of opportunity a resourceful fellow requires. Ducking behind a substantial potted palm and executing a sort of sideways shimmy that would have done credit to a nervous crab, I made a clean break for it, breathing the sweet air of liberty as Biffy’s drone faded behind me. A dashed close-run thing, but all’s well that ends in a discreet exit.
