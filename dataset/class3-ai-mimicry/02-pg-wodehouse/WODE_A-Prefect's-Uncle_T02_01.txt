Well, Headmaster, you put it to me directly, so I suppose a chap must spill the beans. It wasn’t, strictly speaking, a case of malice aforethought regarding young Blicester’s prize-winning newt. It was more a question of sustained and intolerable provocation; a last stand, if you will, for the honour of the Fourth Form. When a fellow has to endure, day after day, another fellow’s insufferable crowing about the superior lustre of his amphibian’s warts—and in front of Matron, no less!—well, a breaking point is inevitably reached. The matter of the tadpole substituted for the newt was, I concede, an act of pure desperation. But consider the provocation! He had likened my batting stance to a flamingo with a stomach ache. It was a purely defensive manoeuvre, sir; a swift, surgical strike against a rising tide of Blicesterian smugness before it engulfed us all.
