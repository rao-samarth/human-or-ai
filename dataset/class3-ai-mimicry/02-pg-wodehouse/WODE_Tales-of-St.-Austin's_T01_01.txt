The scene at Paddington was, to put it mildly, a bit of a maelstrom. My hat had gone south, my ticket was playing hide-and-seek in a waistcoat I was fairly sure I'd left at home, and a porter with the genial expression of a disgruntled bulldog was making ominous noises about my luggage. I was, in short, sunk. It was at this precise moment, when the world seemed darkest and the 3:15 to Market Snodsbury an impossible dream, that a voice like a foghorn boomed across the platform. 'Good heavens, Barmy! Still haven't mastered the simple art of catching a train?' It was Cecil 'Stiffy' Plimsoll, a chap I hadn't clapped eyes on since we'd put a frog in the French master's inkwell a good fifteen years prior. Before I could so much as utter a plaintive bleat, he had collared the porter, located the ticket in my breast pocket (of all the dashed places), and bundled me into a first-class carriage with the efficiency of a sheepdog herding a particularly dim-witted lamb. We were off, and it was as if no time had passed at all.
