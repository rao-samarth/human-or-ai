The air in the dining room had grown distinctly chilly, a rather impressive feat considering the roaring fire and the sheer quantity of port that had been put away. Cuthbert himself, having just been publicly denounced by his Aunt Honoria as a feckless drone and a blot on the family escutcheon for the minor crime of attempting to patent a self-peeling banana, was looking rather like a wilting lettuce. One might have expected his betrothed, the gentle Annabel, to have edged her chair a discreet foot or two away from the newly-minted pariah. Instead, she gave his hand a firm squeeze under the tablecloth—a squeeze that spoke volumes of defiance and camaraderie—and then looked the gorgon-like aunt squarely in the eye with a small, sweet smile that was, in its own way, more formidable than a cavalry charge. Cuthbert, feeling this silent reinforcement, straightened his spine. The banana idea might be a wash-out, but he felt he could now face a legion of aunts with a light heart.
