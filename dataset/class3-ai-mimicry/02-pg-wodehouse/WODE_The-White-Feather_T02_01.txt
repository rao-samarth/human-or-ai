It’s a peculiar thing, but even in a sun-drenched foreign hotel where the waiters all look like brigands, the old rules still apply with a vengeance. A large, florid sort of cove at the next table caught my eye and gave me a hearty wink, as if we’d been chums since the nursery. Now, I’m not saying the man wasn’t a perfectly sound specimen in his own way—he probably paid his taxes and was kind to small animals—but one knew, instinctively, that he hadn’t been through the proper mill. There’s a sort of invisible signal, a quiet frequency on which certain chaps operate, and if you can’t hear it, well, you simply can’t. It’s not a matter of being a snob, you understand; it’s a simple question of social navigation, rather like knowing which end of a cricket bat to hold. Get that wrong, and you’re bound to cause a frightful muddle before the luncheon gong has even sounded.
