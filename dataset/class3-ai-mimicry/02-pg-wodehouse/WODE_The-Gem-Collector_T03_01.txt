It has often struck a ruminative cove, particularly when observing the species at a family get-together, that the finest minds are frequently undone by the sheer, unadulterated obviousness of a thing. One had only to witness my two uncles—one a captain of industry who could float a company on the back of a postcard, the other a Q.C. of terrifying repute—grappling with the heirloom music box that had fallen silent. For a solid hour after luncheon they brought to bear the full, crushing weight of logic, experience, and frowning concentration, all to no avail. Then, my young cousin, a guileless stripling whose mental energies were generally devoted to wondering what was for tea, wandered over, gave a forgotten lever a casual nudge—a lever they had dismissed as purely decorative—and the thing tinkled back to life. It does rather suggest, what, that the whole complex business of adult cerebration is merely a highly polished method for overlooking the button that is right under one’s nose.
