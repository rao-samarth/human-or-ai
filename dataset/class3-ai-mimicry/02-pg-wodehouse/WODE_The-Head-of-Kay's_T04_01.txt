It is a rummy sort of feeling, and one I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, when the marrow in one's bones turns to a sort of chilled blancmange. This sensation visited me with frightful force the moment I realised the quarterly report I had just confidently dispatched to the desk of our formidable chief accountant, a Mr Atherton, was not, in fact, the quarterly report at all. It was, rather, a sheaf of papers on which I had been sketching out ideas for a humorous musical revue, the central character of which bore a striking and, I now saw, a deeply ill-advised resemblance to Mr Atherton himself, particularly in the matter of the ears. The man was a positive demon for probity and correct form; to have him clap his eyes on a libretto in which a character named "Mr Fatherton" sings a lament about misplacing his abacus was a prospect too ghastly to contemplate. Something had to be done, and dashed quickly, for the good name of Pickering was at stake, not to mention the continued employment of its sole bearer.
