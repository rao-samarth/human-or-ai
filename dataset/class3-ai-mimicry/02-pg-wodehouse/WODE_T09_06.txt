Old Witherbottom cleared his throat, a sound not unlike a distant foghorn announcing doom, and I felt my collar suddenly shrink a full size. He was holding the quarterly analysis—the very document upon which my future at Finch & Fitchfeather was precariously balanced. The snag, you see, was that the document was pure Pilbeam from cover to cover; I had merely biffed my own name onto the title page in a moment of what I believe the chaps in white coats call temporary insanity. As Witherbottom began to wax lyrical about its "unprecedented insights," a small but exceedingly persistent voice in my head began to shout blue murder. It advised me, in no uncertain terms, to leap onto the conference table and confess all, thereby becoming the office pariah. I tried to silence the little blighter with a mental biscuit, but it was having none of it, continuing its tirade as my smile became a fixed, ghastly rictus. The whole situation, I decided, was decidedly sticky.
