Strolling through the thick of it all, with the hooting of taxi-cabs providing a sort of grim, modern symphony, I happened to spot the object in question. It was a pocketbook, a rather plump and prosperous-looking specimen of its kind, which had evidently parted company with the waistcoat of a stout party who was now forging ahead, blissfully unaware of his loss. A swift, decisive voice within me—the sort of voice that usually pipes up when the rent is due and the coffers are bare—suggested a simple scoop-and-vamoose manoeuvre, and I must confess, the idea had a certain rosy charm. Why should a fellow who could clearly afford such magnificent tailoring be immune to the occasional spot of redistribution? But then another, feebler voice, sounding suspiciously like my Aunt Mildred after a bad round of bridge, began to prattle on about honour and doing the proper thing. It was a dashed nuisance, really. One moment, I was a simple chap enjoying the city air; the next, a walking debating society on the verge of a frightful moral headache.
