One is frightfully prone, I find, especially in the grim theatre of commerce, to docket a chap based on the merest externals. Consider Abernathy, our head of Finance—a man whose face appears to have been chiselled from granite by a sculptor who bore him a personal grudge. To observe him dissecting a quarterly report, you’d assume his soul was a cold, hard thing, composed entirely of decimals and disdain. You wouldn't, for all the tea in China, suspect a softer side. And yet, during that frightful snafu with the Billing department, when young Perkins was visibly wilting under the heat, it was Abernathy who quietly slid a glass of water onto his desk with a murmur of, “Steady the buffs.” It is a rum business, really. It rather suggests the interior of a man is a far more complicated bit of machinery than the simple, forbidding casing would have you believe.
