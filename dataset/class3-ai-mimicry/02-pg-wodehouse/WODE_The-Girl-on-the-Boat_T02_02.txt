The root of the shambles, you see, lay in the rather airy-fairy description of the fellow I was meant to collar: "a cove of commanding presence, sporting a magenta tie." Well, I ask you! In the thick of Regent Street at lunchtime, you could hardly swing a cat without clocking at least three coves of commanding presence, all of whom seemed to have a penchant for magenta neckwear. I selected the most promising specimen—a vast, bewhiskered buffer who looked as if he breakfasted on broken bottles—and sidled up to deliver the code phrase. "The penguin," I murmured discreetly, "is feeling decidedly off-colour." Instead of the expected reply, the man’s eyebrows shot up like startled grouse; his face took on the purple hue of a ripening plum, and he bellowed, "Constable! Seize this anarchist! He's just insulted my prize-winning horticultural entry!" It was at this precise moment that I spotted the *actual* chap I was looking for, waving cheerfully from across the street, his own tie a rather timid shade of mauve. A sticky wicket, all in all.
