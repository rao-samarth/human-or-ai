It was well past the hour when a sensible cove is generally tucked up in his cot, dreaming the dreams of the pure in heart, but there I was, creeping about old Barmy’s library like a cat burglar with a particularly active conscience. You see, the whole rummy business hinged on a promise—a dashed silly promise, to be sure, extracted from me by young Algernon over a spot of lunch when my guard was down and the steak-and-kidney pie was at its most persuasive. He’d fixed me with those big, sad, spaniel eyes of his, and before I knew what was what, I’d sworn to retrieve an incriminating photograph from his uncle’s desk. And a fellow can’t go back on his word, can he? It simply isn’t done. One doesn’t let a pal down, not even when it involves risking the roaring displeasure of a retired colonel who is known to keep a loaded elephant gun by his bed. It's the sort of thing a chap just *does*, so I hitched up my trousers and crept on.
