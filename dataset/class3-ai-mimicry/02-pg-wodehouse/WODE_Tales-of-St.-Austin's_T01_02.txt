I was listening with one ear to some frightful old duffer proposing a toast to the annual accounts when my eye fell upon poor Gerald, slumped opposite. He was gazing into his glass of lukewarm claret with the fixed, tragic stare of a man who has just been informed that his prize-winning marrow has been disqualified on a technicality. The years since we’d been booted out of old Pemberton’s academy, after that dashed unfortunate business with the catapult and the Senior Dean’s top hat, seemed to melt away like snow in June. There he was, not the prospering solicitor the club circulars claimed, but simply Gerry, the same hapless soul who always got stuck on the stickiest of wickets. A profound and rather startling sort of ache took hold of my waistcoat—a sudden, fierce loyalty that made me want to vault the table, grab him by the lapels, and inform him that the old guard was, as ever, reporting for duty. Whatever the ghastly trouble, one felt with an absolute certainty, he wouldn't be facing the bowling alone.
