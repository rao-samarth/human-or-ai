You ask, sir, precisely how the unfortunate memorandum regarding your proposed flamingo-themed casual Friday was prevented from reaching the august eyes of the Chairman. A direct recall, you see, would have been rather like trying to un-ring a bell—it only draws more attention to the initial clang. The situation, I confess, called for a more nuanced approach. I therefore took the liberty of instigating what the IT department now refers to as 'The Great Coffee Spill of Tuesday Morning', an event which necessitated a full, building-wide network shutdown for emergency maintenance. During this manufactured lull, I was able to access the central server—with a password I happened to acquire from a talkative technician over a shared appreciation for cryptic crosswords—and delete the offending document entirely. By the time the system was restored, the Chairman’s only concern was the lamentable state of the breakroom carpet, and your little dispatch was but a forgotten phantom in the machine. A simple application of controlled chaos, sir.
