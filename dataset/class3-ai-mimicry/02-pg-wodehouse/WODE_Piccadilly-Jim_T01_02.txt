Surveying the scene from my strategic position by the potted ferns, I found my gaze drawn—as a moth is drawn to a particularly dubious candle flame—to my cousin Bertram. He was, at that precise moment, holding forth to the impressionable Millicent Hemlock on the subject of early Mesoamerican sculpture, a topic on which his actual knowledge could have been comfortably inscribed on the back of a postage stamp with room to spare for a short limerick. It struck me then, with the force of a gentle but persistent nudge, that the entire enterprise was fundamentally unsound. One constructs a matrimonial alliance, if one is to construct it at all, on a bedrock of shared interests and mutual esteem, not on an elaborate Olmec-themed fabrication that is bound to shatter the moment old Sir Gregory, her father and a fiend for museums, asks a pointed question about basalt quarrying techniques. The whole affair, I concluded with a sigh, was less a courtship and more a ticking bomb with a wedding-bell chime.
