It is one of the city’s more trying peculiarities, I’ve always felt, that the moment a man’s waistcoat begins to strain at the buttons and his jowls achieve a certain pendulous gravity, he develops an irresistible urge to direct the general traffic of human existence. You see them everywhere, these self-appointed prefects of the pavement, booming out pronouncements on everything from the proper way to board an omnibus to the moral failings of the younger generation. It’s not so much that a young cove actively wishes to cause a fuss, you understand; rather, it is a fundamental law of nature, like apples falling downwards, that when confronted with such a purple-faced monument to self-satisfaction, one is simply compelled to introduce a spot of targeted mischief into the proceedings. This is the universe’s quiet little joke, a necessary pin applied to an over-inflated bladder, ensuring that the general equilibrium of things isn’t irretrievably capsized by the sheer weight of one blighter’s opinion of himself.
