My uncle Godfrey, a man who could find grounds for profound disquiet in a perfectly poached egg, was explaining to anyone who would listen—which at the moment was mostly a potted palm—that the nation was on the brink. One gathered from his hushed, urgent tones that hordes of chaps in peculiar hats were at that very moment oiling their muskets with a view to popping across the water and disturbing the peace. It has always struck me as a rum sort of notion, this expecting a fellow in some distant foreign capital to abandon his daily routine, which I imagine is just as full of vexations as one’s own, for the specific and rather tiring purpose of rearranging one’s political geography. The entire enterprise seems frightfully inconvenient for all concerned. I couldn't help but feel that if these alleged aggressors did finally make an appearance, they would take one look at the state of the village plumbing, decide the whole thing wasn’t worth the bother, and be back on their boat before you could say “knife.”
