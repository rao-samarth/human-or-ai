The spectacle unfolding on the corner of Regent Street was one of those rare treats that make the daily grind worthwhile, a perfect exhibition of man’s heroic struggle against his own two left feet. Young Percival Hemmingway, a fellow whose intentions were as pure as the driven snow but whose coordination was that of a dizzy camel on roller skates, had been tasked with distributing handbills. His chosen technique—a sort of flailing, windmill-like motion that owed more to abstract dance than to effective marketing—had thus far succeeded only in startling a poodle and causing a cascade of leaflets to settle, like defeated birds, upon the bonnet of a stationary omnibus. One particularly zealous lunge, aimed at a portly gentleman minding his own business, instead connected with a newsboy’s sack, sending a flurry of evening papers into the air. Percival froze, a statue of pure, unadulterated failure, and one felt that while the cause of ‘Dr. Thripp’s Patent Hair Restorer’ had suffered a mortal blow, the universe, on the whole, was a brighter, more comical place for his efforts.
