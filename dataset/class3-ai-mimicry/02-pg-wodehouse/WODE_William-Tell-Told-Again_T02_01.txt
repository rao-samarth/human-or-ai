Mr. Grimsdyke, our esteemed Head of Accounts and a man who looked as if he had been suckled on a dill pickle, was in full cry. He had cornered poor Biffy by the water cooler and was giving him what-for in a voice that could have stripped paint, something to do with a misplaced invoice. The rest of us were doing our best impressions of terrified mice, hoping the storm would pass. It was, in short, a sticky wicket. Then, a sound emerged from the corner—a sort of diffident cough. It was Pilbeam, the quiet fellow from Purchasing, who usually moved with the stealth of a cat burglar apologising for treading on the good silver. He had risen to his feet. “I say, Grimsdyke,” he chirped, adjusting his spectacles with a nerveless hand, “that’s quite enough of that. The invoice, you see, was my error entirely. Now, do pop off and stop bellowing like a distressed walrus, there’s a good chap.” A silence fell, thick enough to skate on. Grimsdyke’s jaw dropped, revealing a truly staggering amount of bridgework, and we all held our breath, waiting for the roof to cave in.
