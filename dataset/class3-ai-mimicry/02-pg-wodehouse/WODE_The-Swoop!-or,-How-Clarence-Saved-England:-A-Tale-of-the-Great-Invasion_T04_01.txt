Mr Porson, the editor-in-chief and a man whose waistcoat strained at its buttons like a ship’s rigging in a squall, regarded the typewritten sheet on his desk with the pained air of an uncle who has just been asked to explain the rules of cricket for the fifth time. The article itself was a perfectly sound bit of work, detailing some frightfully important but monumentally dull new drainage initiative down in Sussex. It had facts. It had figures. It had, in short, all the electrifying pep of a suet pudding on a rainy Tuesday. What the readership demanded, as Porson knew with the grim certainty of a man who has studied his circulation numbers, was not the sturdy beef of civic improvement but the fizzy champagne of human folly. Give them a duke who had absconded with a barmaid, or a society pet whose diamond collar had gone missing in mysterious circumstances, and they were happy as clams. This stuff about pipes, however, wouldn't shift a single extra copy; it was good, honest journalism, and therefore completely useless.
