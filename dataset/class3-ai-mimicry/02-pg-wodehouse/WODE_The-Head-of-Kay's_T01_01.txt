Watching young Timothy and his cousin squabble over the last of the cucumber sandwiches put me in a rather reflective mood, I must confess. One is cast back, you see, to a time when a simple difference in necktie colouring represented a chasm wider and more fiercely defended than any geographical border. Good heavens, the sheer, unadulterated passion of it all; a victory in some muddy field-based endeavour was a thing to be celebrated with smuggled ginger beer and song, while a loss—ah, a loss was a tragedy of almost Grecian proportions, plunging a chap into a gloom so profound that even the promise of extra pudding failed to lift the spirits. It all seems so terribly distant now, that earnest fury. The animosity that once felt so solid, so vital to one's very being, has since evaporated like morning mist, leaving behind only the faintest, rather wistful echo of a forgotten battle cry.
