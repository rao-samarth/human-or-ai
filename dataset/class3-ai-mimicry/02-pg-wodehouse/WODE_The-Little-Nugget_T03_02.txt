The initial issue arose when his confederate, the stout and willing Sidney, mistook the fire extinguisher for a battering ram, a miscalculation which resulted not in an open safe, but in a thick and billowy cloud of white powder coating everything from your prized rubber plant to the portrait of your sainted aunt. It was this, rather than the muffled thuds, that drew my attention; a man can only ignore his office suddenly resembling a baker’s storeroom for so long.
