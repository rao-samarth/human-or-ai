The village of Little Wittering had, until recently, been a perfectly agreeable sort of place, known chiefly for its suspiciously robust daisies and a general air of having been forgotten by the twentieth century, which suited its inhabitants down to the ground. This placid state of affairs was rudely interrupted when Beatrice Pounceforth-Crump, a woman whose fortune was exceeded only by her conviction that she knew what was best for everyone, decided the town square needed "a focal point of interactive whimsy." The result, unveiled last Tuesday, was a fountain that, instead of water, spurted lukewarm Bovril at unpredictable intervals. The idea, she explained to a baffled populace, was to provide "a nourishing surprise." Most villagers now take the long way around to get to the butcher's, and the local stray cat population has developed a rather superior and well-fed air. It just goes to show that when a person has nothing but time and money on their hands, their ideas are rarely worth the plumbing.
