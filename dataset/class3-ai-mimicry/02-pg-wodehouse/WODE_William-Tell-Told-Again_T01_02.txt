It was well past the hour when respectable owls knock off for the night, and yet here we were, young Biffy and I, huddled over the plans like a pair of conspirators in a tuppenny dreadful. The opposition, in the shape of Sir Roderick Finch, a man whose heart was constructed from the same sort of flinty material he intended to pave our village green with, had seemed a dashedly immovable object. For a week, gloom had descended upon the cottage. But then Biffy, after a thoughtful moment with his third crumpet, had produced this absolute corker of a scheme. It was a thing of beautiful, intricate madness, hinging on a misdirected flock of prize-winning geese and an anonymous tip-off to the local bird-watching society. As he sketched the final details, a warm glow began to suffuse the old spirit. One felt, with a surging certainty, that while chaps like Finch might have the big battalions on their side, we had the element of inspired lunacy, and in these sorts of dust-ups, that’s what invariably carries the day.
