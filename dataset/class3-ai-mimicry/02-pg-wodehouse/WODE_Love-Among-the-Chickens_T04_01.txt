The Dowager’s annual fundraising gala had, with the inevitability of a bad oyster, curdled into a first-rate fiasco. The string quartet had apparently entered into a suicide pact with their instruments, producing a sound hitherto only achieved by torturing a family of mandrills, whilst the guest of honour, a pugnacious Bishop, was now locked in a fierce and undignified struggle with a potted fern he insisted had insulted his wife. It was, in a word, ghastly. From across the maelstrom of flailing limbs and shattered crystal, I saw Alistair. He wasn’t panicking, nor was he, like so many others, making a beeline for the exits; he simply stood by the wreckage of the buffet, calmly inspecting a crushed vol-au-vent with the air of a seasoned archaeologist. He met my gaze and offered a small, weary shrug, a gesture that spoke volumes of exploded marquees and runaway prize pigs past. In that instant, amidst the shrieking and the sheer, awful ruination, a profound calm settled over me. Come what may—be it social Armageddon or merely a faulty pudding—one knew, with a certainty that bucked a fellow up no end, that one would not be facing the ghastliness alone.
