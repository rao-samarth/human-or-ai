I watched old Blevins present my 'Synergistic Outreach Paradigm' to the board, his chest puffed out like a pouter pigeon that’s just spotted an unguarded bag of seed, and found myself in a bit of a pickle. A lesser cove, one not forged in the crucible of the Lower Fourth, might well have sprung to his feet and cried foul, pointing out that the paradigm was jolly well his and Blevins wouldn’t know a synergy if it bit him on the leg. But one simply can’t, you know. There’s a certain code hammered into a chap from an early age—you don’t tell tales, you don’t sneak, and you most certainly don’t show up a fellow, even a bounder of the first water, in front of the top brass. So one sits there, nodding sagely and projecting an air of serene approval, while inwardly composing a rather blistering limerick about a manager from Nantasket. It’s dashed inconvenient, but there it is.
