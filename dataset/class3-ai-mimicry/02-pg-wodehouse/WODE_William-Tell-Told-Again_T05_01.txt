It was on the crossing to Boulogne that the general populace, so to speak, finally got its back up. The whole affair was lorded over by a purser who combined the genial charm of a dyspeptic bulldog with the administrative zeal of a chap who’s just discovered red ink. He’d been ticketing passengers for infractions like ‘unseemly whistling’ and ‘excessively jaunty walking’. The breaking point, if you can believe it, came over a biscuit. A small, unassuming man with spectacles, a Mr. Pringle, was about to dunk his digestive when the purser declared it a violation of deck-chair etiquette. Pringle looked at the biscuit, then at the purser, and with a quiet dignity that fairly took the breath away, he dunked it. A hush fell, then a sort of low cheer went up from the assembled invalids and holiday-makers. Before you could say ‘knife’, old General Fotheringay was leading a chant, and someone had hidden the purser’s hat. A sticky business, but it just goes to show what a biscuit can do in the right hands.
