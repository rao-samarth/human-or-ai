It must have been well past two in the morning when I found myself nose-to-nose with the portrait of Great-Uncle Ferdinand, a cove whose primary contribution to the family annals appears to have been a singular inability to look at a painter without adopting the expression of a startled halibut. And yet, this was the specimen, this very chap, who had been given the keys to the whole shooting match, expected to make weighty decisions and generally keep the ship of state from bumping into the furniture. The thinking, as I pieced it together in the silent house, was that because his father had been a dab hand at the job, the talent must have trickled down like jam through a sieve, landing squarely on young Ferdy. It struck me as a frightfully rummy system of organization, rather like entrusting one's prize-winning roses to a tortoise simply because its father had been a reasonably competent tortoise. Baffling, when you really gave the old grey matter a workout.
