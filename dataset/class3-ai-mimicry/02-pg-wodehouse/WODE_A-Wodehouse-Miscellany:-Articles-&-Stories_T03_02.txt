The pickle into which young Bertram had wedged himself was, it must be said, entirely of his own brining, having rashly informed his charming cousin Penelope that he was a dab hand with airborne objects—a statement promptly intercepted by the ever-attentive ears of his Aunt Beatrice. Now, with the entire drawing-room clamouring for a performance and three dinner rolls pressed into his trembling hands, the moment of reckoning had arrived, and a dashed sticky one it was shaping up to be. But just as despair began to settle like a wet Tuesday, a flash of pure, unadulterated genius illuminated the young chump’s mind. With the gravity of a high priest, he announced that his was not the vulgar, toss-and-catch school of juggling, but the far more cerebral ‘Conceptual Method,’ a daring new art form exploring the *potential* for motion. He then proceeded to arrange the rolls in a thoughtful pyramid on the mantelpiece, discoursing on their "gravitational harmony," an act of such sublime and baffling audacity that it silenced even Aunt Beatrice and earned him a look of sparkling admiration from Penelope, who, it turned out, rather preferred a quick wit to a clumsy juggler anyway.
