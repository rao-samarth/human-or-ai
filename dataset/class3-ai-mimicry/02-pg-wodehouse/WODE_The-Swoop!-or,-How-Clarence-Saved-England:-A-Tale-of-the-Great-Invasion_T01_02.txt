It struck me as dashed odd, as I surveyed the glittering assembly, that while the chaps in charge were making the very air tremble with their solemn pronouncements—all about the precarious nature of the national whatnot and the absolute necessity of pulling together—the actual pulling together in our immediate vicinity seemed exclusively concerned with the sherry trifle. Young Biffy was holding forth on the lamentable state of his tailor's buttonholes, while his aunt Agatha seemed on the verge of a seizure over a misplaced salt-cellar. One began to form the view that if the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse themselves were to clatter into the dining room, the prevailing sentiment would be less one of cosmic dread and more a pained critique of their muddying up the good carpet. It’s a peculiar sort of anaesthetic, I suppose, this dogged insistence on the miniature; a refusal to let the larger, more alarming spectres spoil a perfectly good slice of Stilton.
