Reginald P. Smallwood, a man whose charm was laid on with a trowel and whose conscience was about the size of a mustard seed, descended upon young Timothy Finch's desk like a vulture sighting a particularly plump and stationary lamb. Timothy, a guileless soul who believed that 'team spirit' was something akin to a sacred trust, looked up from his ledgers with a welcoming, dog-like expression. Smallwood proceeded to spin a yarn concerning a desperately sick aunt—an aunt who, if she had existed, would have been expiring on a bi-weekly basis for the last five years—and the absolute, soul-crushing necessity of his presence at her bedside. The long and the short of it was that the month-end reconciliation report, a beast of a document bristling with figures, simply had to be tamed. Would Timothy, as a personal favour of the most profound sort, see to it? Before the ink was dry on the unspoken agreement, Smallwood had vanished in the direction of the nearest sporting gazette and a quiet pint, leaving Timothy to wrestle with the numbers, his brow furrowed in the noble, if entirely misplaced, glow of self-sacrifice.
