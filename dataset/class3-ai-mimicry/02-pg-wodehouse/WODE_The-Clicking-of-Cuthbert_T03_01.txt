It was well past midnight, and the house had settled into that profound quiet which rather encourages a chap to do a spot of solid thinking. Young Etherington had been over for dinner, you see, and had spent the better part of three hours explaining some new-fangled continental theory—all about the Abstract Whatnot and the Subjective Something-or-other. Frankly, it strikes a fellow as a rum sort of business, all this mental heavy-lifting. Give me a clean drive off the first tee, where the ball either flies straight or it doesn’t, and there's no bally nonsense about its existential trajectory. A chap knows precisely where he stands with a cricket bat; if you miss the thing, you're out, and no amount of high-minded chin-wagging about the essential duality of the willow can alter the fact. There's an honest-to-goodness solidity to it all, a refreshing lack of bilge, which you simply don’t get from these blighters who treat conversation as a sort of intellectual wrestling match and expect you to applaud their dreary, high-brow somersaults.
