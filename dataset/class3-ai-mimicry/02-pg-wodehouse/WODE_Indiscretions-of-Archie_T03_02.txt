It was well past two in the morning, an hour when a chap’s mind, untethered from the day’s trivialities, tends to address the stickier problems of existence; in my case, the rather pressing matter of the evaporating exchequer. Aunt Agatha, in a letter penned with a nib that seemed to have been dipped in acid, had intimated that the time was ripe for me to embrace what she termed “a proper vocation.” The suggestion, one had to concede, possessed a certain grim logic, yet it failed to account for the central obstacle, which was my profound and carefully nurtured disinclination for anything requiring prolonged assiduity. I had, in the quiet of the armchair, considered the problem analytically. Becoming a secretary to some bigwig in the City seemed a possibility, until one pictured the sheer quantity of ink and paper involved. The whole business, I concluded after some moments of deep thought, was dashed inconvenient. A solution would undoubtedly present itself in the morning, probably after kippers.
