I had entered the boardroom that morning feeling, I don’t mind admitting, like a conquering hero returning from the wars with a particularly shiny bit of loot. My presentation on quarterly projections was, I felt, a masterpiece of the genre—witty, insightful, and sprinkled with just the right amount of intellectual seasoning to show the chaps I wasn't merely a pretty face. The word "pulchritudinous" had seemed the absolute *mot juste* for describing our profit margins. A bit of flair, what? It was then that old Abernathy, peering over his spectacles as if examining a peculiar beetle, gently pointed out that the word referred to physical beauty and had about as much to do with financial statements as a teapot has with astrophysics. The subsequent silence was not the appreciative kind. No, it was the thick, soupy sort of silence that fills a room when a fellow has just tried to tap-dance on a banana peel and achieved the inevitable result. I felt my soul shrink to the size of a disregarded pea.
