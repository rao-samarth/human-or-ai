It was a thing to make a senior partner pause and scratch his head, this sudden and unnerving metamorphosis of young Cedric Pilbeam. Hitherto a fixture known principally for his unique ability to spill tea on important contracts and for taking an hour and a half for lunch, Pilbeam had overnight become a veritable titan of industry. He arrived early. He stayed late. He even, on one memorable occasion, volunteered to collate the annual report. Baffled, I cornered old Weatherby in the hallway. “Weatherby, what in blazes has got into Pilbeam? Has a rich aunt left him a fortune conditional on him actually working for it?” Weatherby chuckled, a dry, rustling sound. “Richer than that, my dear chap. He’s been struck all of a heap by Miss Albright in reception. The poor young ass thinks that by becoming a model of commercial diligence, he might one day be worthy to ask her to the pictures. It’s a rum go, but it seems to have turned a perfect drone into a ruddy dynamo.”
