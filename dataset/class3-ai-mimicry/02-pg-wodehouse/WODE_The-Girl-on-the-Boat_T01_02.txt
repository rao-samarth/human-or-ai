Observing young Pilkington attempting to secure the affections of the vicar’s niece was an education in itself, a sort of masterclass in how not to do it. The poor blighter, normally a fellow of some limited sense, had transformed into a gibbering marionette whose strings were being pulled by a distinctly malevolent cosmic force. He’d spilled his drink, complimented her hat—which she wasn’t wearing—and was now explaining the intricacies of newt breeding with a feverish intensity usually reserved for chaps on the run from the constabulary. It makes one ponder the whole bally enterprise, this strange and frantic dance we are all expected to perform. One moment you are a rational being, capable of balancing a chequebook; the next, you are a babbling imbecile, all for the sake of a pair of bright eyes and the slim chance of not dining alone for the rest of your days. It’s a rummy business, and one can’t help but feel that some higher power is leaning back in its celestial armchair, thoroughly enjoying the slapstick.
