I watched old Biffy from across the expanse of damask and silverware, and a grim sort of fascination took hold. A whisker-twitching financier, the sort of cove who looks as if he was born wearing a spivvy tie, was murmuring sweet nothings about Argentinian silver mines into his ear. Now, Biffy’s a good egg—one of the best—but his grasp on finance is such that he probably thinks a dividend is a type of exotic bird. Yet, you could see the little wheels whirring behind his eyes, which had taken on a rather unholy glitter. The old conscience, that stout and reliable butler of the soul, was clearly being handed its hat and told to take the evening off. It’s a rum business, really; you can spend a lifetime cultivating a stiff upper lip and a sense of fair play, only to find the whole structure wobbles like a blancmange in a high wind the moment someone mentions a twenty-per-cent return.
