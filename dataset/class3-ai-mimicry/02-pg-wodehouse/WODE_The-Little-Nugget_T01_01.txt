It was one of those drowsy summer afternoons in Sussex when the only sensible activity is to find a deck-chair and let the grey matter gently simmer. I was doing just that when I caught sight of my Uncle Percy lurking by the rose bushes, a look of fevered concentration on his face that one usually associates with chaps trying to solve a particularly sticky crossword puzzle. The blighter, it transpired, had hatched a truly rummy notion involving the local snail population. Apparently, he’d read that a certain type of garden pest produced a slime frightfully valuable to a Parisian cosmetics firm, and his new brain-wave was to establish a sort of snail farm. He planned to encourage them with gourmet lettuce leaves, collect the proceeds in a jam jar, and then, as he put it, “retire to the Riviera.” The current phase of the operation involved him poking at a particularly large specimen with a twig, whispering words of encouragement. I closed my eyes. The lengths to which a fellow will go for a bit of the old unearned increment are, when you come to think of it, quite extraordinary.
