I caught sight of my Aunt Honoria across the glittering expanse of mahogany, and I must say the old dear looked as if she’d just been handed a telegram announcing the total collapse of the silver market. Her face, usually a placid landscape of well-bred contentment, had crumpled like a dropped blancmange, the lower lip quivering with a sorrow too deep for words. The source of this personal Armageddon, I soon gathered, was the new man, Perkins, who was at that moment committing the unspeakable solecism of decanting the Dow's '27 with his thumbs pointed—if you can credit such a thing—outwards. It was a sight to curdle the very blood. One felt that the foundations of a civilised society were rocking on their pins, that all was dross and ashes, simply because Perkins had failed to grasp some esoteric bit of bottle-juggling. A single, glistening tear traced a path through her expensive face-powder, a silent, tragic indictment of a world that had clearly forgotten how to handle its port.
