There is a certain species of fellow, one you invariably find tethered to a desk in the name of commerce, who approaches the annual Inter-Departmental Sales Drive with the sort of grim-jawed intensity generally reserved for chaps heading over the top at Ypres. Bartholomew in Accounts, a man whose spectacles seem to have been welded to his face at birth, has taken to glaring at young Perkins from Marketing as if Perkins had just made off with the family silver—all because the blighter managed to secure the Tilbury contract. They call it ‘friendly rivalry,’ of course, and speak of ‘playing the game,’ but the atmosphere is less that of a jolly good scrum on the playing fields and more that of two starving dogs eyeing the last sausage. One is expected to clap the victor on the back and murmur ‘Well played, old man,’ but frankly, what one really feels is an urge to advise both parties to have a nice cup of tea and a long lie-down. It’s all rather trying on the nerves, this business of winning a commemorative fountain pen.
