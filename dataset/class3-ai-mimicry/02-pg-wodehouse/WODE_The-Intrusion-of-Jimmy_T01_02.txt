I found myself rather trapped by the potted aspidistra, listening to my Uncle Peregrine hold forth on the lamentable state of the Basset-Finches. It seemed young Cyril Basset-Finch, despite a lineage stretching back to whichever powdered ancestor first cornered the market on decorative snuff boxes, had made an absolute hash of things by marrying a girl whose people, apparently, were in trade. Peregrine spoke of bloodlines with the sort of quivering reverence a chap usually reserves for a vintage port or a winning horse, his jowls wobbling like agitated blancmange. Meanwhile, I could see across the drawing-room the very fellow my new cousin-in-law, Bobbie, had brought along—a cheerful cove named Henderson who, I’m told, started with nothing but a spanner and a bright idea and was now a king of industry. Henderson was patiently showing my young nephew how to fold a napkin into a swan, a feat far beyond anyone in our family, and looking a dashed sight more of a gentleman than poor Cyril, who was at that moment trying to spear an olive with his tie-pin.
