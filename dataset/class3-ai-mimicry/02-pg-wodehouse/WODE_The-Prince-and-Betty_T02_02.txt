It had fallen to Uncle Alistair, as it always did on these occasions, to perform the high and sacred rite of opening the vintage port—a delicate business involving heated tongs, a feather, and the sort of grave concentration usually reserved for defusing an unexploded bomb. This solemn pageant was, however, rudely interrupted by young Cecil, freshly returned from a spell in America and fairly fizzing with what he called ‘streamlined solutions’. He produced from his pocket a ghastly nickel-plated contraption of springs and needles which, he announced with a beaming smile, could pop a cork using a puff of inert gas in naught-point-three seconds flat. Before the assembled company could do more than goggle like landed fish, a faint *pfft* was heard, the cork flew into a bowl of nuts, and the deed was done. Uncle Alistair, tongs still poised mid-air, wore the expression of a saintly bishop who has just witnessed a music-hall comedian juggle with the sacred relics. It was efficient, certainly. It was also, in a way that defied easy articulation, fundamentally blasphemous.
