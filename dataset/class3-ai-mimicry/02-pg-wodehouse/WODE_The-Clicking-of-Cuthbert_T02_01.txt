I’d always considered young Reggie a bit of a non-starter in the romantic stakes, what with his sole passion in life being the collection of antique doorknobs. A chap can’t exactly woo a girl, I’d reasoned, by pointing out the superior craftsmanship of a Georgian brass oval. But then Daphne fluttered into town, and blow me down if the two weren't suddenly thicker than thieves. I bumped into them outside the tobacconist's, and Reggie was practically incandescent, explaining with wild gestures how he’d located a rare Bakelite specimen from the nineteen-thirties. Instead of looking baffled, as any right-thinking person would, this Daphne gel was all agog, her eyes shining like newly polished knockers. She was apparently a fiend for escutcheons herself. It was a rummy sort of revelation, I can tell you; it seems the surest path to a fellow’s heart isn’t through his stomach, but via a mutual appreciation for utterly barmy bric-a-brac.
