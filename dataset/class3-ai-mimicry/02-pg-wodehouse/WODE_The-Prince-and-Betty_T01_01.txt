So that’s what you truly think of me, is it? That I am merely some sort of calculating machine in a fetching frock, ticking off the assets on a ledger while your uncle recites his perfectly ghastly sonnets. It’s a low blow, frankly, and a rummy sort of welcome to the family. I had rather imagined you saw something more in the arrangement—a flicker of warmth, perhaps, a modicum of honest-to-goodness fondness for the old dear—but I see now that was a dashed silly notion. You look at me and all you can see is the glint of the family silver reflected in my eyes, a walking balance sheet with an excellent dress sense. It isn’t the trust fund you mind, is it? It’s the appalling, unbelievable notion that someone could actually *care* for the man, saxophone and all, without a single thought for the consolidated stocks and shares. Well, it stings, you know. It stings like the very deuce.
