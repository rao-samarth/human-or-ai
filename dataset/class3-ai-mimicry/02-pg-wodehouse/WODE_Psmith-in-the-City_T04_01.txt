It was during the solemn, post-pudding phase of the evening, when Uncle Algernon had begun his annual sermon on the Decline of Practically Everything, that the call to action became simply too insistent to ignore. He had a voice like a foghorn that had been to a good school, and he was using it to pin us all to our chairs while he droned on about the ghastly lack of backbone in modern youth—waving his glass of sacred, decade-old port about to punctuate his points. A fellow can stand only so much, you know. It seemed to me then, in a flash of what I can only describe as tactical genius, that a bit of counter-laxity was precisely what the situation demanded. I cannot, to this day, explain the sudden, involuntary twitch that overtook my left elbow; one moment it was resting peacefully beside my dessert plate, the next it had shot out with the vim of a released spring, connecting squarely with the leg of the small table bearing Algy’s tipple. The resulting crash and clatter, I must say, did wonders for the conversational atmosphere.
