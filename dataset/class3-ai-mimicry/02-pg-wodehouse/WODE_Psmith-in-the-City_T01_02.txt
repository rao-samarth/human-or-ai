It's a rum sort of notion that strikes a chap from time to time, typically when observing the great daily migration of his fellow bipeds into the city's commercial heart. One sees them—a veritable legion of fellows in sober suiting—spill from the trains, each with a briefcase clutched like some sacred relic, and march with a sort of grim, purposeful listlessness towards their allotted desks. There, I suppose, they pass the sunlit hours shifting identical sheaves of paper from one tray to another, an activity whose ultimate purpose remains as veiled and mysterious as the private life of the common whelk. The whole thing has the distinct air of a complicated ritual performed for a deity who has long since popped off and forgotten to tell anyone. It all seems a frightfully circular bit of business, really; a grand, shuffling rigmarole designed to keep the trains running on time so that the same chaps can shuffle the same papers again on the morrow.
