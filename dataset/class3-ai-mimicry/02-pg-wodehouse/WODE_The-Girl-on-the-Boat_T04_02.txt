It was a truth universally acknowledged in the parish of Little Wittering that young Cuthbert "Cuffy" Dibble was a cove whose upper storey, to put it kindly, was sparsely furnished. His attempts to win the esteem of the local squire, a peppery gentleman of the old school, had hitherto been exercises in futility, generally culminating in Cuffy apologising for having inadvertently set fire to a prize-winning shrubbery or introduced a family of dormice into the pantry. And yet, there he stood on the village green, a beatific smile plastered across his face, clutching the blue ribbon for "Most Original Jam." It transpired that his concoction—a ghastly, bubbling brew born of a misread recipe and the mistaken inclusion of his uncle’s favourite chutney—had, by some miracle of chemistry, turned out to be the one thing that could tempt the palate of the chief judge, a visiting potentate whose taste buds had been notoriously jaded for years. The Squire was heard to emit a sound that was almost a grudging compliment, and Cuffy himself felt a warm glow, the sort of glow a chap feels when, after a long spell of being a general chump, he suddenly finds he’s accidentally done the right thing.
