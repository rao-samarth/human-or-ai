It was one of those grey, listless afternoons on the Calais-to-Paris express, when the soul tends to droop a bit and one contemplates the general futility of things. Across the carriage, a young fellow with a tie that screamed for attention was attempting to woo a rather lovely girl by pontificating on the merits of French wine, a subject on which his ignorance was as vast as it was palpable. He swirled an imaginary glass, tossing out words like ‘terroir’ and ‘bouquet’ with the desperate air of a man quizzed on irregular verbs. The girl nodded politely, her expression one of pleasant vacancy, until her eyes drifted to the window. Not at the fleeting poplars, but at the reflection of the quiet old bird in the corner seat, who was peering at a pressed flower in a little notebook with an expression of such profound and simple joy that it was like a candle being lit in a dusty room. The wine expert’s monologue sputtered and died, you know. You simply can’t compete with a chap who has genuinely found his buttercup.
