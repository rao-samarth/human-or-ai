Leaning on the stile and watching old Farmer Tregaskis mend a bit of his neighbour’s fence—a clear case of trespass, if you asked the local magistrate—I found myself tumbling into one of those deep, thoughtful states that usually only come upon a fellow after a particularly stiff sherry. It struck me as a rum sort of business, this whole affair of what’s right and what’s permitted. One has aunts, for instance, who wouldn’t bend a by-law to save a drowning kitten and yet possess souls that are, to put it mildly, on the shrivelled side of the prune. Then you have chaps like young Biffy, who seems to collect minor summonses the way other people collect stamps, but who would cheerfully charge a ravening lion to retrieve a dropped monocle for a perfect stranger. The whole thing’s deucedly complex; it’s as if the fellows who drew up the rules did a perfectly sound job on the big stuff, like murder and what-not, but rather blotted their copy-book when it came to the finer points of human decency.
