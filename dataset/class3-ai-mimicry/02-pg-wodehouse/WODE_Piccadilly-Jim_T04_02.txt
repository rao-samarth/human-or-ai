The scheme, as conceived by young Reginald Pootle in the jolting solitude of his third-class carriage, had seemed to possess all the earmarks of a master strategist at the top of his form. The simple objective was to convey a particularly pungent Stilton—a cheese expressly forbidden by his travelling companion, Aunt Dahlia, on olfactory grounds—to his host in Little Wigging. The solution, which had come to him in a flash of pure genius, involved sealing the offending dairy product within a hollowed-out travel tome entitled *A History of the Turnip*. What could be sounder? All proceeded swimmingly until the train lurched with exceptional violence, catapulting the book from the luggage rack. It landed with a hollow thud, sprang open upon impact, and skidded to a halt directly at the feet of his aunt, who had just entered, presenting her with the sort of ripe, cheesy spectacle that causes strong women to wobble and reach for the smelling salts. Reginald could only watch, a frozen statue of horrified imbecility, as she fixed him with that familiar gimlet eye.
