It was a dashed tricky business, this whole wooing affair. I had cornered Beatrice by the aspidistra, fully intending to press my suit with the sort of dogged determination Uncle Algernon always advocated. "A woman," he'd once boomed over the port, "is like a stubborn jar of pickles, m'boy. One must simply apply consistent, unyielding pressure." Yet, as I gazed upon the girl, a peculiar thought struck my cranium. She did not look like a pickle jar awaiting a firm hand; she looked more like a hunted fawn that had just heard the hounds baying and was contemplating a desperate leap through the conservatory window. A formidable aunt, observing the tableau from over her teacup, was beginning to resemble a hanging judge. The whole "never-give-up" spirit, so lauded in song and story, suddenly felt less like noble chivalry and more like being a first-class pest. Was one to soldier on, or beat a retreat and live to woo another day? It was a problem of the first water, and my brain, never the most muscular of organs, fairly creaked under the strain.
