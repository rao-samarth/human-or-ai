You would think, to hear the fellows on the wireless biffing on about it, that the entire country was about to slide gracefully into the sea, taking the national reserves and a good deal of the population’s stiff upper lip with it. A proper pickle, by all accounts. Yet, down in our sleepy corner of the world, the prevailing mood was less one of grim-jawed resolve and more one of mild irritation over the postman’s new schedule. The impending collapse of all we held dear, it seemed, ran a poor second to the great debate raging at the Dog and Duck as to whether young Pilbeam’s prize-winning rhubarb was, in fact, suspiciously oversized. One chap, a retired Brigadier with a nose that had clearly seen active service, went so far as to opine that while fiscal ruin was a dashed nuisance, the real threat to civilization was a vegetable of questionable provenance. It quite makes you wonder what it takes to get a chap’s dander up these days.
