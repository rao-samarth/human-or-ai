I was just explaining to Freddie, as we tucked into a scone at that little tea-shop off the square, the frightful stickiness of the whole human-race arrangement. You see, you get your chap who knows which fork to use instinctively and doesn’t need a blueprint and a team of engineers to navigate a formal dinner, and then you get your other sort of blighter who, if left to his own devices, would probably try to butter his roll with the sugar tongs. It’s a dashed rummy business, but there it is. The thing is simply bred in the bone, you know—a certain unmistakable what-not that separates the fellow who belongs in the members’ enclosure from the cove who looks more at home shouting at a passing omnibus. It isn’t a question of cash, you understand, but of a kind of fundamental wiring; some chaps are simply built to appreciate a decent port, and others, well, they just aren’t. Frightfully simple when you boil it down.
