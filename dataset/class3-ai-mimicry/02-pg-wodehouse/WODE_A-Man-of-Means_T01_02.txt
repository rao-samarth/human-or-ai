It was, in a word, a beastly impasse. I found myself pinned against the potted ferns by my two aunts, Honoria on the left and Millicent on the right, both eyeing me with the sort of purposeful glint a hungry stoat reserves for a particularly plump rabbit. The question at hand, you see, was which of their pet causes would receive the annual Ponsonby family donation: Honoria’s Society for the Betterment of Unemployed Butlers, or Millicent’s newly-formed League for Distressed Dachshunds. The entire pickle, I mused, was only possible because one’s coffers were, so to speak, uncommonly full. To favour the butlers was to earn a lifelong black mark from the dog-loving Millicent, whose disapproval manifested in terrifyingly sweet smiles; yet to fund the hounds would invite a snort from Honoria that could shatter glass. A blighter with an empty pocket, I reflected miserably, could have simply expressed his profound regret and nipped off for a sherry. Instead, I stood there, a financier on the rack, wishing desperately that I was just a simple, penniless sort of chap.
