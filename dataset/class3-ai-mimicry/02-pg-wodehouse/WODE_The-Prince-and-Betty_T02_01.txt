Lord Bumbershoot, a man whose profile always put one in mind of a startled pug that had just sat on a thistle, fixed his nephew Algernon with a glittering eye. "Filing cabinets? From some ghastly patent office in Philadelphia? You seriously propose to manage the Bumbershoot affairs—affairs which, I'll have you know, have muddled along perfectly well since the Conquest—using these metallic monstrosities and a system of coloured tabs?" Algy, who had unfortunately returned from his American tour with a brain fizzing with what he called 'streamlined methodologies', merely polished his monocle with infuriating calm. "It's all about efficiency, Uncle. No more rooting about for three days in that dusty old ledger of Grandfather's, the one young Mildred uses to squash spiders with. This way, you find the tenant receipts in a jiffy." His uncle's face, already a rich claret, deepened to a shade usually reserved for antique mahogany. To suggest the hallowed Bumbershoot Ledger was merely a spider-squashing implement, to be usurped by a mass-produced Yankee contraption, was an outrage that struck at the very foundations of civilized life. He puffed out his cheeks, looking for all the world like a pouter pigeon that had received the black spot.
