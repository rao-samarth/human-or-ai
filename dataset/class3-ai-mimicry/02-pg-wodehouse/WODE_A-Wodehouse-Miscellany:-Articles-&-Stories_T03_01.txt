The quandary facing young Alistair was, one must concede, entirely of his own construction. Having rashly guaranteed the vicar a prize-winning pumpkin for the annual village fête—a boast made in a moment of sherry-induced largesse—he now found himself proprietor of a vegetable so woefully undersized it would have blushed to find itself in a tureen of soup. A lesser man might have considered flight, or perhaps a sudden, convenient illness. Alistair, however, after a brief period of chin-on-fist contemplation that rattled the very rafters of his garden shed, was struck by an idea of simple, unadulterated genius. He procured a magnifying glass of startling power from the local tobacconist and mounted it on a handsome mahogany stand directly in front of the diminutive gourd. A neatly lettered card was placed beside the display: “For a closer appreciation of its perfect, concentrated form.” The judges, peering through the lens at what appeared to be a veritable behemoth of the pumpkin world, were roundly impressed by his innovative presentation and awarded him a special commendation for services to horticulture.
