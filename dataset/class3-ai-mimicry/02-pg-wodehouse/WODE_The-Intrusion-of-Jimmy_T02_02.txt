My dear chap, I feel I must warn you about the host’s brother, a certain Major Fotheringay, should you bump into him near the canapés. At first glance, the man is utterly formidable—jaw like a bulldog chewing a wasp, a moustache that could have taken a prize at Crufts, and the sort of glacial blue eye that suggests he’s mentally reorganising the British Empire. You’d peg him as a fellow who breakfasts on dynamite and wrestles bears for sport. But then he opens his mouth, and the entire imposing structure collapses like a badly made soufflé. After five minutes pinned against the wall, I assure you, the only empire he’s concerned with is the one ruled by his prize-winning guinea pigs, Basil and Cecil, and their dashedly intricate dietary requirements. It quite takes the wind out of a fellow’s sails, I can tell you.
