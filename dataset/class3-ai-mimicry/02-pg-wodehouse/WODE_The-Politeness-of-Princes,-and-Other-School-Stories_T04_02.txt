It is a peculiar and rather trying feature of club life that one is periodically forced to overhear the sort of sentimental guff that would make a hardened tortoise blush. Take the two specimens braying at each other over by the fireplace, for instance. To hear Perkins Minor tell it—his voice possessing the sort of carrying power usually reserved for foghorns—he and the chap with the unfortunate moustache had been locked in a state of chummy solidarity since a shared escapade involving a catapult and the matron’s prize-winning begonia. A noble brotherhood, he called it. What utter rot. This so-called sacred oath, forged in the fires of youth, is generally nothing more than a tacit agreement between two chaps who, having failed to impress anyone else in the intervening decades, find it convenient to have a reliable source for a loan and a willing ear for the same five anecdotes they’ve been trotting out since the Coolidge administration.
