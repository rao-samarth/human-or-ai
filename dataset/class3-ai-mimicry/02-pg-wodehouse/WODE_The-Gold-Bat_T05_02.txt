I was taking the air on a park bench, attempting to sort out a rather knotty problem concerning an aunt and her Pekinese, when the chap next to me began to unburden himself to his companion. It seemed he had been roundly done in at croquet that morning by, of all people, the local curate—a pink-faced specimen of the breed who apparently played with a ferocity one seldom sees outside the Coliseum. The aggrieved party spoke less of the defeat itself, which a fellow must bear with a stiff upper lip, than of the curate’s distinctly questionable method of coaxing his ball through the final hoop. A lesser man might have raged, but this chap merely sighed, concluding that while winning is all well and good, it’s the manner of the thing that truly separates the chaps from the bounders. And, having listened in, I found myself in complete agreement; there is a certain quiet dignity in being pipped at the post by an honest rival, but to be undone by clerical skulduggery is a bit thick, even before luncheon.
