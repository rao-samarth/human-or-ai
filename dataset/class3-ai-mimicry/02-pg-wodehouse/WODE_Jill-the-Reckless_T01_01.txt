One can't help but feel a bit of a philosopher, you know, when one finds oneself wedged into a tea-shop chair some fiend designed for a smaller species of man entirely, and obliged to eavesdrop on the chatter at the next table. The two specimens to my left, both of whom looked as if they’d been constructed from whalebone and disapproval, were dissecting the grave matter of some poor blighter named Cynthia who had apparently worn the wrong sort of hat to a garden party. You’d have thought from their expressions—the dropped jaws, the wide, horrified eyes—that the wretched girl had turned up with a live stoat on her head instead of a bit of felt and a feather. It was all frightfully solemn. I found myself wondering if they ever discussed anything that actually, well, *mattered*, before concluding that it was probably a dashed silly question to ask. The whole thing made one feel that if a meteor were to strike the earth, their first concern would be whether it clashed with their pearls.
