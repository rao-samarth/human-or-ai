It has often struck me, when observing the male of the species in the throes of a romantic entanglement, that his first impulse is not to approach the matter with a direct and manly candour, but rather to construct some elaborate and frightfully wobbly piece of stage machinery. One couldn't help but overhear the young blighter at the next table, for instance, outlining a scheme involving the engineered misplacement of a Pomeranian, the subsequent heroic recovery of said animal, and the resulting gratitude—and, one presumes, propinquity—of its female owner. It seemed a frightfully intricate bit of business, the sort of thing that requires more precision timing than a Swiss watch and is infinitely more likely to come a cropper. The fundamental flaw in these manufactured emergencies, you see, is that they fail to account for the essential chaos of life; the dog might bite the wrong person, the girl might have already left for her aunt's, or—most devastatingly—she might simply despise small, yapping dogs on principle. A sounder method, it has always seemed to me, is simply to stand near the subject and look hopefully pathetic.
