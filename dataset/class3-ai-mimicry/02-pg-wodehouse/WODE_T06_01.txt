It was at that precise moment, as I was steadying myself for a frontal assault on a scone, that the green-eyed monster, as I believe the expression is, nipped me smartly in the trouser-leg. For there, across the tearoom, was Penelope, laughing—a gay, tinkling laugh that I had always considered my personal property—at some ghastly bounder with a chin you could open tins with. A dark and noxious vapour seemed to fill my interior, a sort of spiritual indigestion that made the scone look suddenly malevolent. The fellow was leaning in, you see, practically breathing on her hydrangeas, while I sat marooned with my teacake, a forgotten man. A low, guttural sound, rather like a drain in its final death-throes, escaped my lips, causing a stout party at the adjacent table to start violently and spill tea all down his waistcoat. I hardly noticed; my whole being was consumed with a black desire to stride over and bean the blighter with the nearest sugar bowl.
