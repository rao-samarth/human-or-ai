It's a dashed peculiar business, this whole matter of forming a sound judgment of one's fellow man. Take the cove I shared a railway carriage with from Paddington, a rather stout specimen with a tie that was, if not precisely singing in the choir, at least humming the tune respectably. For the first hour, I found him a thoroughly good sort, full of what seemed to be unimpeachable views on the proper way to treat a sprained ankle and the utter folly of the modern novel. A sound egg, I thought to myself. And then, just as we were rattling past Slough, he happened to mention in an off-hand way that he’d spent his formative years at Market Snodsbury Grammar. Well, I ask you. The whole structure of his reasoning immediately collapsed like a badly-made jelly. You can’t, you see, place any real stock in the opinions of a chap who hasn’t had the basic principles of life hammered into him at a proper institution; his entire mental outlook is bound to be wobbly.
