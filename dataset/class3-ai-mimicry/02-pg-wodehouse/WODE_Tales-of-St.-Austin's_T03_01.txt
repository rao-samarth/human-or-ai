A rum sort of quiet had descended upon our little corner of the county, the sort of quiet that suggests a bomb might have gone off if only anyone had the energy to light the fuse. The birds still tootled in the ancestral oaks, and the sun shone with its customary indifference, but a distinct chill pervaded the air between Mortimer’s and Pringle’s. One simply didn’t fraternise. A chap from Pringle’s, spotting you across the quad, would suddenly discover a passionate interest in a dandelion, while our own lot would affect the stony gaze of men who have witnessed horrors beyond telling.

To see the Pringle’s contingent swaggering about, frightfully pleased with themselves, you’d think they’d single-handedly won the Great War rather than a simple bat-and-ball contest. It was a dashed awkward business, and one that made a fellow yearn for the uncomplicated society of newts and water-boatmen.
