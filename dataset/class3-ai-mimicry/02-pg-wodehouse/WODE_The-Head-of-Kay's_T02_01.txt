It’s a dashed rummy business, this business of being placed in charge of the young. I had been instructed by my Aunt Prudence, a woman who could out-stare a basilisk, to ensure that young Wilfred knuckled down to his holiday studies. The task, I can tell you, was rather like trying to teach a squirrel to knit. The moment I so much as breathed the phrase ‘irregular verbs,’ the blighter’s face would assume the pained expression of a saint who’s just been asked to sit on a thistle. He’d counter my stern pronouncements with a sudden, urgent inquiry about the migratory habits of the common garden snail, or feign a sneezing fit of such violence it threatened to unseat the family portraits. A fellow who has weathered the sternest glares from club committees and survived three of his sister’s amateur theatricals ought, by rights, to be able to quell a single small boy, but somehow the thing can’t be done. It fair makes you question the whole established order.
