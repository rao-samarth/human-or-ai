Reginald Pootle, having poured what he considered the very finest vintage of his soul into a slogan for Grimstone’s Gastronomic Sardines, felt the foundations of his world begin to wobble. He had presented his magnum opus—“A Silver Symphony in Oil”—with the sort of quiet pride a hen might feel upon laying an ostrich egg, only to have Mr. Grimstone, a man whose creative instincts had long since been pickled in brine, stare at it as if it were a suspicious-looking haddock. There followed a silence of the most profound and unnerving sort, the kind that usually precedes either the reading of a will or the announcement that the cook has absconded with the silver. Finally, the great man cleared his throat. "A bit much, isn't it, Pootle?" he rumbled, tapping a thick finger on the offending typescript. "Sounds less like lunch and more like something you'd get from a poet with a head-cold. We're selling fish, not fugues. Try again, but this time with more... well, you know. Oomph."
