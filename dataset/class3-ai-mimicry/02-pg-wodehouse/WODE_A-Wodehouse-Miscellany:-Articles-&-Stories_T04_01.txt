I quite see your point, Vicar, and I’ll be the first to admit that finding blue spots on the prize-winning marrow must have been a rummy sort of shock for the judging committee. But if you’re looking for what the chaps in the novels call a motive, you’ll have to look further than yours truly. My Uncle Reginald, you see, has lately developed the singular notion that vegetables are susceptible to low spirits, and he insisted the marrow in question was looking distinctly down in the mouth. The spots, he explained later with a frightening degree of logic, were a form of chromatic therapy designed to restore its natural bonhomie. I would, of course, have intervened, had not my Cousin Prudence at that very moment attempted to demonstrate her newfound ability to hypnotise chickens using only a teaspoon and a pocket handkerchief, a spectacle that rather commands one’s full attention. So while I may have held the ladder, the whole unfortunate affair stems less from malice and more from a general family trait of wanting to jolly things along.
