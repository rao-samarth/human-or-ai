My Aunt Dahlia, having concluded on the ferry that the local dialect was a rather shoddy bit of work designed purely to vex the visiting Englishman, was now attempting to convey the complexities of our luggage situation to a baffled-looking hotel clerk. Her method, which she’d apparently gleaned from a pamphlet on international amity, involved a series of staccato hand-jabs, a truly ghastly amount of smiling that stretched her face into a rictus of bonhomie, and a slow, loud enunciation of English words as if the poor fellow were not merely foreign but also a trifle deaf and dim-witted. The clerk, a man whose expression suggested he was mentally composing his letter of resignation, simply blinked. I, for my part, found it wisest to retreat to a nearby potted palm, affecting the air of a man who had never seen this woman before in his life. At such times, one can only marvel at the peculiar conviction held by certain relatives that the entire world is a stage for their own private, and profoundly witless, theatricals.
