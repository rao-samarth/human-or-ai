Young Pilbeam in Accounting, for instance, had constructed a ruse involving back-dated invoices and a fictitious Transylvanian syndicate that was so byzantine it would have given a seasoned diplomat a splitting headache. The sheer brain-power he was expending to convince old Mr. Abernathy that our firm had cornered the global market in novelty teacups could, if applied to legitimate channels, have probably earned him the coveted Christmas bonus twice over. But no. For some blighters, the simple, straight path is never as appealing as one fraught with peril, trapdoors, and the looming spectre of being summoned to the head office for a sticky ten minutes. I suppose the glittering prize itself is only half the fun; the other half is the sport of seeing if you can actually get away with a plan that has more holes in it than a colander in a hailstorm.
