There are times, and this was emphatically one of them, when the dedicated pursuit of the arts strikes a chap as a singularly bone-headed way to get through life. One sits staring at a blank sheet of paper, the old brain-pan having seemingly been emptied of all its contents and refilled with lukewarm porridge, while the Muse, that flighty female, is presumably off somewhere enjoying a Pimm's with a stockbroker. Outside, the city roars on, a ghastly symphony of motor-horns and shouting newsboys, each toot and bellow a mocking reminder that while you’re trying to find the perfect adjective for 'sunset', chaps with the souls of chartered accountants are raking in the doubloons hand over fist. It’s a dashed grim business, all in all, and gives one the distinct feeling that taking up a career in, say, professional newt-judging would have been a far sounder financial proposition.
