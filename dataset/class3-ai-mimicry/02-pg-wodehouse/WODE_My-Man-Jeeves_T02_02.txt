My host, a cove whose brain was generally understood to be on a permanent sabbatical, was staring into his ornamental pond with the sort of tense, furrowed brow a sapper might adopt when considering which wire to snip. The issue at hand, he explained after I had coughed politely for the better part of two minutes, was one of frightful social urgency concerning the fins of his new Japanese Koi. It seemed the Trotter-Spankleys next door had acquired a school of carp whose fins possessed a subtly superior iridescence, a development that had cast a positive pall over our man’s entire season. He spoke of ‘tonal integrity’ and the ‘crushing vulgarity’ of last year’s scales, his voice trembling with the gravity of it all, and I found myself wondering if a nicely aimed prod with a garden rake wouldn’t solve the problem for both of us—clearing his head, you know, and providing the fish with an unexpected luncheon.
