I was doing my best to wrestle with the club’s crossword—a fiendish bit of work involving a seven-letter word for an obscure Patagonian rodent—when a voice from the next table trickled into the old ear-hole. It belonged to Freddie Pilkington, a chappie whose intellect was generally considered more ornamental than useful. 'Take a dekko at that blighter by the fireplace,' he was murmuring to his guest, a fresh-faced lad new to our little circle. 'Looks like he breakfasts on paving stones and snarls at thunderstorms for a hobby, what?' The individual in question was indeed a formidable spectacle, all jutting jaw and beetling brow, the sort of fellow you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley unless you happened to *be* the dark alley. 'Well,' Freddie continued with a conspiratorial wheeze, 'that, my dear boy, is Algernon Spink. The nation's foremost authority on the emotional lives of garden snails. Apparently, they're frightfully sensitive.' I abandoned my crossword; some revelations are simply more important than Patagonian rodents.
