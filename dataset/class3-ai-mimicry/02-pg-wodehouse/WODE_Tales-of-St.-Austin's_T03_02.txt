It was one of those late hours when even the most boisterous of chaps has toddled off to the land of nod, and a fellow could sit by the dying embers of the fire and contemplate the larger things in life—the larger things, in this case, being the unmitigated cheek of Henderson's lot from across the quad, who had, by some lamentable fluke, pipped us to the post for the Cricket Shield. A lesser man might have brooded, gnashing the odd tooth. But as I surveyed the sleeping forms of my comrades—young Biffy snoring like a faulty gramophone, little Psmithers twitching as if dreaming of algebraic equations—a warm and buoyant feeling filled the old waistcoat. It was the sort of cast-iron certainty that tells you that while the opposition might currently have the silver, we had the spirit. Yes, by Jove, we had it in spades. Next term, I reflected, Henderson's swaggering crew wouldn't know what had hit them. We'd bounce back, brighter than a new sixpence, and that dashed cup would be back on our mantelpiece where it belonged.
