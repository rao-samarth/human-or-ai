Yes, I admit it all. As I stood there on the Persian rug, with Aunt Mildred fixing me with a gaze that could have soured milk at fifty paces, I knew the game was up. I had indeed forgotten to post her letter to the vicar regarding the annual village fête’s tombola prize. A frightful oversight, I grant you. But the prosecution, if I may call her that, fails to appreciate the mitigating circumstances. A chap had just received a rather shattering telegram, you see. My sock man in the Burlington Arcade—a fellow who understood my particular needs regarding argyle and ankle-cling—is retiring to the seaside to raise ferrets. Ferrets! The foundations of a gentleman’s wardrobe crumble, the very fabric of one’s daily comfort is torn asunder, and I’m expected to have the presence of mind for tombolas? I ask you, as a court of reasonable people, is it fair? Is it just?
