It’s a rummy business, this whole London scene, when you stop to think about it. As I watched the human tide surge past the club window, I spotted old Boffington, a man so rich he probably used ten-pound notes for kindling, steering along a chit of a girl who wore the sort of frozen smile you see on a fish at the market. A pure business transaction, if ever I saw one. And yet, not ten feet behind them, a young fellow in a rather shabby coat was gazing at a girl with a hat that had clearly seen better days, and the two of them were beaming at one another as if they’d just been handed the keys to the city. It gave a chap pause for thought. I mean, one can get frightfully keen on the old filthy lucre, and nobody enjoys an empty trouser-pocket, but when you weigh it all up, I’m not so sure I wouldn’t trade a hefty dividend for a slice of that sort of goofy, star-struck nonsense. Dashed if I wouldn’t.
