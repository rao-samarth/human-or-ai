I was minding my own business over a pot of tea at the club, wondering if it was emotionally possible for the chef to produce a crumpet that wasn’t a first cousin to a paving slab, when I couldn’t help but overhear the chap at the next table. A pallid sort of blighter, he was attempting to dazzle his female companion on the topic of rare orchids, spouting Latin names with the sort of wooden gusto one usually associates with a list of train times. The poor girl was trying to look captivated, but her eyes had glazed over something shocking. Then, from two tables down, a rosy-faced old cove began booming to his friend about the sheer, unmitigated joy of cultivating a new species of—what else?—orchid. He wasn't speechifying; he was simply fizzing, positively incandescent with delight over stamens and pollination and whatnot. In a tick, the girl’s head had swiveled toward the authentic noise, her expression brightening like a switched-on lamp. The first fellow was left high and dry, looking for all the world like a man who has just realised his prize-winning marrows are, in fact, cleverly painted cucumbers.
