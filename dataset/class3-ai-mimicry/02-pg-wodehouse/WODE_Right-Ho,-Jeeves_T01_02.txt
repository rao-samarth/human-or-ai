Cuthbert Murgatroyd, tiptoeing across the library carpet in a dressing-gown that had seen better days—and, for that matter, better dressing-gowns—felt the keen thrill of the seasoned conspirator. It had fallen to him, as the family’s resident man of action, to retrieve the small porcelain frog from his nephew’s desk before it could be used as evidence in what was shaping up to be a most unfortunate breach-of-promise case. Young Biffy, a good lad but one whose intelligence was more ornamental than functional, had clearly landed himself in the mulligatawny, and it required a cool head and a steady hand to fish him out. The fact that the frog was a treasured gift from Biffy’s Aunt Agatha and the supposed jilted party was merely the new parlormaid with a head cold was a detail that had entirely escaped Cuthbert’s notice. He prised open the desk drawer with the grim satisfaction of a surgeon, blissfully unaware that he was not so much lancing a boil as applying a poultice to a perfectly healthy shin.
