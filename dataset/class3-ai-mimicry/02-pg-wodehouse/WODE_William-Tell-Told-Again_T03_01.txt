It was one of those beastly London afternoons when the pavement is a seething mass of humanity, all shoving and bustling and generally behaving like agitated tadpoles in a jar. My son, young Timothy, was trotting happily beside me, clutching a strawberry ice that was his pride and joy, when a slab of a fellow—a cove with a face like a bulldog chewing a wasp—barged through the throng. The ice, naturally, went west, creating a pink catastrophe on the cobblestones. Timothy’s lower lip began to wobble, a sure-fire prelude to a vocal performance of staggering volume. The bounder merely grunted, not so much as a by-your-leave, and for a moment I stood frozen. But then I saw the tear, the single, glistening tear, making its lonely way down Timothy’s cheek, and something inside me snapped. A primeval instinct, a sort of paternal berserker rage, took the helm. I am not a fighting man—my constitution is better suited to a quiet corner and a cup of tea—but I tapped the brute firmly on his colossal shoulder, my knuckles fair rattling against the tweed.
