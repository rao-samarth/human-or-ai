It was a dashed peculiar state of affairs, one had to concede, for a young fellow like Percy Fitz-Simmons to be holding the reins of the village’s annual fête committee—a post usually reserved for chaps of a more seasoned vintage with bristly moustaches and a firm opinion on jam. With his own uncle unexpectedly called away to inspect a rare species of newt, Percy found himself suddenly responsible for everything from temperamental prize pigs to the structural integrity of the cake stall. A lesser man might have quailed, but Percy, bless his cotton socks, felt a peculiar sort of fizz bubbling up within him. Far from being a frightful chore, the whole business was bracing him like a cold plunge on a frosty morning. He discovered a hidden talent for placating rival marrow-growers and a surprising knack for organizing the three-legged race. It was all rather wonderful, really, proving that even when a chap is tossed into the deep end, he can jolly well learn to swim.
