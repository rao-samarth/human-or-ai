It was, I reflected as I rattled the unyielding brass knob for the seventh time, what you might call a sticky wicket. The door to my chambers remained resolutely bolted, and a perishing chill was beginning to creep up from the flagstones in a manner that spoke ill for the morning’s lumbago. A lesser man, finding himself marooned on the wrong side of his own threshold with his favourite plaid dressing gown and slippers locked within, might well have thrown in the towel—or, more probably, a bit of a tantrum. But it has always been a point of pride with me that when the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune start doing their worst, one simply braces the old shoulders and squares the jaw. The drawing-room sofa, a beastly affair stuffed with what felt like ancient cannonballs, awaited my weary frame. It wasn't ideal, not by a long chalk, but a chap simply had to find that inner reservoir of fortitude, that quiet dignity, and remind himself that things could be considerably more bally. After all, I might have spilled soup on my trousers earlier, which would have added a whole new layer to the ghastliness.
