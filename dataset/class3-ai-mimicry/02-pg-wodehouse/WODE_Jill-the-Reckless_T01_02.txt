It’s a peculiar business, this daily pageant along the city’s smarter pavements. You watch the chappies and the debs float by, all beaming at one another with the sort of high-voltage goodwill that could power a small train. "My dear boy, absolutely capital to see you!" one booms, while patently trying to recall which of the five hundred similarly tailored young men this particular specimen might be. The whole show is frightfully well-rehearsed, from the precise angle of a tipped hat to the carefully modulated squeal of delight upon spotting an acquaintance. It gives a fellow the distinct impression that if one were to peel back the layers of expensive tweed and silk, one wouldn't find a beating heart so much as a clockwork mechanism, wound up each morning with a key of pure, unadulterated what-ho. It’s all rather exhausting to observe, and makes one yearn for the straightforward honesty of a well-made beef sandwich.
