It was during one of those somnolent post-prandial sessions, when digestion is at its height and the will to argue at its lowest ebb, that my Uncle Reginald chose to deliver his annual address on the moral failings of modern finance. He had just reached a particularly fruity passage concerning the fecklessness of his own junior clerks when Percy, my cousin Mildred’s parrot, who had hitherto been a silent observer, cleared his throat with a sound like a rusty hinge and announced, “Utter bilge, old boy!” There followed a brief, electric silence. Uncle Reginald, a man whose profile could have been used to frighten birds from crops, swivelled a dangerous eye towards the cage, but before he could marshal his forces for a counter-attack, the feathered critic added, with a note of finality, “Put a sock in it.” It was at this juncture that I noticed young Mildred examining a spot on the ceiling with an air of profound, almost saintly, detachment, and I realised that the established order of things had received a nasty jolt from which it would not soon recover.
