Mr Abernathy, having wedged himself into a jam of the first water by promising the same prime contract to two separate commercial chappies, was now advocating a course of action that gave his dutiful assistant, Pilbeam, considerable pause. The guv’nor’s proposal—to inform the waiting Mr Fitzwilliam (of Fitzwilliam’s Finest Fedoras) that the entire third floor had been unexpectedly quarantined due to a sudden outbreak of a rare tropical fungus—struck Pilbeam as lacking a certain finesse. It wasn't so much the lie itself, for a certain elasticity with the truth was often required in the service of a superior so prone to social blunders, but its sheer, unadorned daftness. To obey was simple; to refuse was unthinkable. And yet, to proceed with the fungus narrative felt like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, with the added risk of the sledgehammer bouncing back and landing squarely on one’s own foot. A flicker of inspiration, cool and silvery, shimmered in Pilbeam’s mind—a far more elegant stratagem was forming, one that might just soothe both parties without resorting to phantom botany.
