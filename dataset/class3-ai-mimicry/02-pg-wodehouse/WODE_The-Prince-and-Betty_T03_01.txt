The delegation from Upper Pelling found young Lord Ashworth in the west conservatory, endeavouring to teach a parrot to recite limericks—a task for which neither party seemed remotely equipped by nature. It was a rummy business, when one stopped to give it the once-over. Here was a collection of horny-handed sons of the soil, their brows furrowed by grave matters of crop rotation and a truly diabolical drainage issue, seeking guidance from a fellow whose chief intellectual struggle that morning had been trying to remember on which side of the toast one spread the marmalade. That this amiable noodle, simply by being the direct consequence of the sixth Lord Ashworth’s brief but productive dalliance with the matrimonial state, was now the final arbiter of their fortunes was a state of affairs that might have given a thinking man pause. Fortunately for the general peace of mind, thinking men were in short supply, and Algernon had just remembered a particularly spicy one about a man from Dundee, which he felt the parrot absolutely had to master before luncheon.
