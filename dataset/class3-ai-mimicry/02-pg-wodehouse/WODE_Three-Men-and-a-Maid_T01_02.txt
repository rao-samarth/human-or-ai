You demand an explanation, Aunt Agatha, and while the spirit quails, the facts must be faced. The entire enterprise, I must admit, was predicated on a rather delicate chain of reasoning. The thinking, in a nutshell, was this: if I could contrive to get perched in the upper branches of your prize oak, feigning distress, young Annabel—who has, you know, a frightfully tender heart for all creatures in a fix—would be compelled to rush to my aid. It seemed a masterstroke at the time, a direct appeal to her gentler nature. What I had not budgeted for, you see, was the sheer slipperiness of the oak after a light drizzle, nor the fact that the gardener, a man with no poetry in his soul, would mistake my plaintive cries for those of a distressed cat and summon the fire brigade. It all goes to show that when a fellow’s intellect is clouded by a certain pair of blue eyes, his subsequent actions are liable to cause a thoughtful man to clutch his head and groan feebly.
