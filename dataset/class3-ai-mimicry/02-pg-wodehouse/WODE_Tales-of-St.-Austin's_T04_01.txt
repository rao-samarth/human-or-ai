I ran into young Freddie Pilkington on the eleven-forty-five to Brighton, and a more dejected-looking cove you would be hard-pressed to find outside of a chap who’s just backed the wrong horse in the two-thirty. He was slumped in his seat, regarding a passing sheep with a bleakness that suggested the animal had just delivered some frightfully bad news. It all came out over a lukewarm cup of railway tea: a rather sticky affair involving himself, Eustace Biffen, and a stationmaster with a pronounced dislike for high-spirited young men singing sea shanties on his platform. When the blue-uniformed authorities descended, it seems Freddie had executed a swift and silent fade-out, leaving poor Eustace to face the music alone. It was, I gathered from the crimson hue of Freddie's ears, a catastrophic blotting of the old copy-book. It’s simply not done. One stands by a fellow in a tight spot, particularly when the root of the trouble was one’s own idea—a foundational precept of civilised life hammered into one’s head long before quadratic equations. He knew it, the sheep probably knew it, and his soul was suffering accordingly.
