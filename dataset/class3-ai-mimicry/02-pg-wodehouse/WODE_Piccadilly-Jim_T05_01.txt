Sitting here on the old stone bench, with nothing more pressing on the agenda than to watch a fat bumble-bee investigate a hollyhock, a chap begins to see the flaw in young Chester's philosophy. A dashed energetic specimen from across the pond, Chester had surveyed this very scene and spoken, with a sort of wild, glittering eye, of ‘maximizing the pastoral experience’ and implementing a ‘leisure-based key performance indicator.’ It was all a bit much for the nervous system before luncheon. He seemed to view a quiet afternoon as a problem to be solved, a patch of inactivity that needed to be filled with go-getting and result-oriented relaxing, whereas I've always found that the best way to deal with a quiet afternoon is to simply let the bally thing be. It gives the old grey matter a chance to lie fallow, which, as any farmer will tell you, is frightfully important for the next harvest of half-baked ideas.
