It’s a rummy sort of business, I must say, when a fellow can’t pop out for a spot of lunch without finding half the city has gone distinctly dotty. The pavements were simply seething with chaps gesticulating at the sky, their faces wearing the sort of expression you see on a terrier that’s just spotted a particularly impertinent rat. Apparently, some cove had seen something suspicious—a dirigible behaving in a foreign manner, or perhaps it was a pigeon with an odd look in its eye; the reports were tangled—and the whole populace had immediately decided the game was up. I saw one stout party in spats trying to use a copy of the *Times* to board up a tobacconist’s window, a measure which struck me as unlikely to deter a determined foe. It all seemed a frightful over-reaction. If a chap can’t maintain a certain level of sang-froid in the face of a rumour, what, I ask you, is the bally point of having a stiff upper lip in the first place?
