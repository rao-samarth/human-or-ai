The Judge held forth at the mayor's table, his voice as rich and syrupy as the port wine staining his lips. He spoke of some poor scoundrel he’d sent up the river, and he called the affair a fine example of balanced scales and righteous consequence. But I watched the glint in his eye—a particular fire that a man don't get from balancing books, but from settling a personal account with a bit of extra weight on his own side of the ledger. The world has a high-minded name for when the law gets even for you, and a lower one for when you do the job yourself; but it seems to me the appetite is much the same. It’s only a question of who owns the gavel, for the man who gets to call his satisfaction ‘justice’ is simply the fellow who was clever enough to get the whole town to swing the hammer for him.
