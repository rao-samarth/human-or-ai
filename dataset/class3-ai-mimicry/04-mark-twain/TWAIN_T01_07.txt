My cousin Theodore, who possesses a soul otherwise dedicated to sensible accounting, got it in his head last Christmas to construct a gingerbread house of such architectural splendor that it would shame the county courthouse. He commandeered the kitchen with the grim authority of a riverboat captain navigating a fog, declaring the entire space a sovereign nation dedicated to molasses and gumdrop masonry. For a fortnight, the man was a tyrant; children were shushed, aunts were banished, and his poor wife was relegated to the role of a lowly hod carrier for peppermint sticks. And Lord, he finished it—a two-story confectionary marvel with spun-sugar windows that caught the light like a cathedral’s. He stood beside his creation, chest puffed out like a pouter-pigeon, expecting a torrent of applause; instead, he received only the profound and echoing silence of a parlor full of relatives he’d thoroughly alienated. A man can build himself a mighty fine castle, it seems, but find he’s locked all the people out.
