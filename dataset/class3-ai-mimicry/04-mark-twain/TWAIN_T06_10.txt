They want to know my grievance against ol’ Patterson, as if a man needs a signed and notarized document to account for a souring of the soul. It began, I can tell you, with no more than a new coat of paint on a picket fence—but that paint, a white so blindingly pure it seemed to mock the very sun, began to work on me a peculiar misery. I’d look upon his gleaming pickets, and suddenly my own respectable shingles looked like a pauper’s teeth. His rooster seemed to crow with a more prideful authority; his well water, I commenced to imagine, must taste of nectar and his Sundays of a more certain salvation. A man can abide his own patch of weeds, you see, but it becomes a genuine affliction—a biblical trial, even—when his neighbor’s garden blooms as if tended by angels themselves. And soon enough, a sickness of the spirit like that finds it needs a bit of company, so it crawls out of a man’s mouth in the form of a whisper and goes looking for other gardens to blight.
