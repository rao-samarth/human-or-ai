You see that specimen over there by the fountain—the one with the wild look and the sack of stale bread? He has arrived at the unshakeable conclusion that certain pigeons are in the employ of the mayor, acting as spies on the citizenry. A more pernicious and addle-brained notion has likely never taken root in a human skull, yet he pursues his investigation with the solemnity of a high court judge. He’ll stalk a particular bird for hours, jotting notes in a little book and muttering about treason, occasionally flinging a crust with a contemptuous flick of the wrist, as if to say, “Take your bribe, you feathered Judas!” The rest of this great metropolis, this grand hive of industry and swindlers, rushes past without a glance; but for him, the fate of the Republic hangs upon exposing the conspiracy of the common rock dove. It is a spectacle of such concentrated foolishness that one is almost compelled to admire it.
