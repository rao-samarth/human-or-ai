They proceeded to erect two entirely different commercial enterprises under the same roof, each believing the other to be engaged in a kind of deliberate, malicious idiocy. The result was not a disagreement, but a demolition, and a partnership of two decades was reduced to little more than a pile of lawsuits and mutual contempt, all fertilized by a half-dozen ill-chosen words on a sheet of company letterhead.
