Look here, it ain't the public hollering that worries a man, not really. A body can get accustomed to a town's worth of gossip and sideways glances; that's just noise, like a loose shutter in a windstorm. No, the real difficulty is the private accounting you're forced to undertake when the lights are out and there's nobody left to fool but yourself. It’s a pesky kind of arithmetic where you keep adding up the particulars of your own foolishness, and the sum is always the same—a figure so disagreeable it sours your breakfast before you've even had it. You can lie to the preacher, you can put on a tolerable performance for your neighbors, but the fellow who sleeps in your own skin—well, he knows the genuine article. He’s the one who keeps the ledger, and confound it, he never misplaces a single entry.
