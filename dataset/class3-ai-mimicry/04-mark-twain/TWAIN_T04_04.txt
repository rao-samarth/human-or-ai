A man’s true composition, I have come to believe, is a thing that cannot be rightly judged in the comfortable confines of a town, where the liquor is cheap and the talk is even cheaper. You must take him out where the conveniences are scarce and the road is long—that is the proper laboratory for such an experiment. I once traveled with a fellow who, in the city, was a fountain of grand declarations and back-slapping assurance; his loyalty was a coat he wore with great and showy pride. But when the rains turned the trail to a hog-wallow and our provisions dwindled to hardtack and bitter coffee, that coat began to look mighty threadbare. His promises, once so robust, became thin, complaining whispers on the wind. It is a curious fact of human nature that a man’s convictions are often directly proportional to the fullness of his belly, and when fortune turns sour, the most steadfast-seeming companion can curdle faster than milk in a thunderstorm.
