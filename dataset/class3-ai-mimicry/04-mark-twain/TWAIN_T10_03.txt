You watch old Henderson over there, holding court by the mercantile, and you might mistake him for a dispenser of pure, unvarnished information. He has a gift for it; he gives a man just enough of a fact to make him feel well-fed, all the while keeping the main portion of the meal locked away in the pantry. He’ll tell you the river rose three inches, which is so, but he neglects to mention it was after a month-long drought and is still ten feet below the flood line—a detail of some consequence. He carves off a convenient sliver of what happened and presents it as the whole carcass, leaving his listener to construct a monstrous beast out of a perfectly ordinary bone. It is a quiet and respectable sort of larceny, you see, stealing a man's good sense by simply failing to hand over the part of the story that would have saved it.
