There’s a peculiar science practiced in our town when it comes to delivering a piece of news, especially the sour kind. An unvarnished fact is a fearsome, wild thing, you see, and it isn't considered fit for polite company until it’s been properly tamed and groomed. Take the matter of the new town bell, which cracked clean in two on its very first peal. Did the councilmen admit they’d purchased the cheapest article from a swindler a county over? Heavens, no. That would be an act of unchristian coarseness. Instead, the Parson himself explained from the pulpit how the bell had sacrificed its own integrity in a burst of pure, pious enthusiasm for the Lord’s work—a martyr in cast iron. The congregation, bless their hearts, found this explanation so moving that they passed the collection plate twice to pay for its replacement, which I suspect will come from the very same bargain-bin foundry. A well-dressed fiction, it seems, will always outrun a naked truth, especially when the truth is headed uphill.
