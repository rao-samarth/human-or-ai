Uncle Phineas had the floor, as he generally did after the third helping of pot roast, and he was using it to hammer some sense into poor cousin Jedediah. “The sin, my boy,” he proclaimed, tapping a thick finger on the tablecloth for emphasis, “is not in being poor, but in the desperate and godless scramble to get rich without the dignity of labor.” Jedediah, who had lost a month’s wages on what he swore was a sure-thing trotting horse, could only stare at his peas. Now, it struck me as a curious point of theology that a man’s wager on a horse was a damnable offense, while the very same man—my esteemed uncle, for instance—could sink a fortune into a speculative land company promising to drain a mosquito-infested swamp in Florida and call it “a prudent investment in the nation’s future.” I reckoned the primary difference was that the horse, at least, had a fighting chance of finishing the race.
