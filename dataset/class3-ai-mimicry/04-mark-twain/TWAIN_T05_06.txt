A fellow can find himself in a peculiar sort of bind at a Sunday social, particularly when his own kin are the ones cinching the knot. There was Annabelle Perkins, a perfectly tolerable girl if you had a particular fondness for sensible shoes and conversations that never strayed north of the weather, and her father was explaining the magnificent prospects of a new smokehouse. My dear aunt was beaming at me with an expression that plainly said, “Secure the smokehouse, boy, and you secure your future.” It was a solid, dependable future, I reckoned, full of predictable suppers and well-cured bacon. But my mind, that treacherous vagabond, had already hitched a ride out of town with the fiddler's daughter, a girl whose own future was as uncertain as a river in springtime and whose laughter sounded a blamed sight prettier than any talk of curing meat. I stood there, nodding about hog futures and smiling like a simpleton, feeling my own prospects split right down the middle—one half smelling of hickory smoke and propriety, the other of road dust and a song I couldn't get out of my head.
