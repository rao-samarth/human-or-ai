To see young Thatcher in the barber’s chair, you’d have thought the razor was aimed at his very soul instead of his chin-whiskers. He was a picture of pure misery, and the reason for it was sitting right in his coat pocket—a one-way ticket to some godforsaken territory out west. Old Man Hemple, whose only notable journey had been from his front porch to the general store, was holding forth on the subject. He declared it was Providence; the boy’s pa had built a fine business, and it was the boy’s preordained duty to step into it, plain and simple. But the town cooper, a man who’d lost two fortunes and was cheerfully starting on losing a third, slapped his knee and cackled. He said a fella’s life is a river he’s got to navigate himself, and if he wants to steer his boat straight over a waterfall—well, that’s the grandest liberty a man possesses. Thatcher himself just stared at his reflection, pale as a spook, looking like a man who’d just discovered the oars to his boat were made of soap and the current was flowing in both directions at once.
