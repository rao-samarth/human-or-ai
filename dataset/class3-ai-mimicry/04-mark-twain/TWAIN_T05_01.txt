Now, you listen to me and stop all that confounded fretting. I know what the town expects, and I know what promises feel like—they’re like anchors, and a fellow feels mighty virtuous for carrying them around, even if they’re dragging him straight to the bottom. A man's word is a fine and solid thing, I’ll grant you that; it’s the bedrock he builds his house on. But what good is a house, I ask you, a fine and proper house with a locked front door, if the soul of him is shivering outside in the rain? It strikes me that the highest calling, the one that straightens a man’s spine for good, ain’t about keeping a ledger of obligations that’ll sour his own milk for forty years. It’s about figuring out how to build a gate in the fence, not tear it down—to find the one path where your feet and your heart are walking in the same blessed direction. That ain’t selfishness; that’s just plain, honest-to-goodness navigation.
