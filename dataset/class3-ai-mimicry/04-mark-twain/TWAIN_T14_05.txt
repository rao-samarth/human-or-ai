Young Finnerty stood over the type case, sweating like a parson at a horse race, wrestling with a line of lead as if it were the devil's own scripture. He had it in his head that by setting down one particular truth about Mr. Gable’s feed-and-seed business—a small, mean truth, but a truth all the same—he was performing an act of monumental justice that would straighten the crooked path of our whole town. I watched him, and it struck me what a grand piece of humbug a man can sell himself—this notion that his own two hands are on the tiller of his circumstance. Why, he was no more than a stray leaf caught in the main current, spinning about with great purpose and conviction, all the while being hustled downstream toward the same damnable waterfall as the rest of us. He could set the type or melt it down; it made no matter. The presses would run, the paper would be delivered, and the whole affair would end up lining a birdcage, same as any other.
