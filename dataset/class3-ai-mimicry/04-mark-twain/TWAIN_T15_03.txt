Now, I see the looks on your faces—every last one of you, from Cousin Jebediah down to little Martha—and I am persuaded you believe my reason has taken a permanent holiday. But not one of you ever took a moment's true contemplation of that singular paving stone by the rosebushes. It wasn't merely out of place; it was an affront, a calculated insult to geometry and good Christian sense. For weeks it tormented my waking hours and haunted my slumber, a grey tyrant squatting in the walkway, its corner cocked at an angle that suggested a kind of geological insolence. I would pace the veranda until dawn, plotting its downfall; I would reason with it from the window, pleading for it to just settle itself proper. And when no amount of civilized petitioning could right the blasted thing, a man is left with but one recourse. So I fetched the crowbar and the sledgehammer. It lies now in a thousand righteous pieces, and I am finally at peace. Why you should choose this particular moment, with the devil finally evicted from our property, to hold a tribunal is a mystery that quite escapes me.
