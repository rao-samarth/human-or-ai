For three days, the Professor had been lecturing us on everything from Egyptian pottery to the moral failings of the grasshopper, and the other passengers in the stagecoach swallowed it whole. I, however, had taken his measure. As the coach gave a particularly violent lurch, I leaned over the space between us. "Professor," I says, my voice low enough so as not to carry, "a man who knows so much about so many things ought to know the difference between a quartz lode and a common piece of river rock." Well, sir, a curious change came over that man’s face; the scholarly benevolence drained right out of it, like water from a leaky bucket, leaving behind the cheapest sort of scoundrel you’d ever hope to avoid at a card table. He didn’t say a word—didn’t have to. The man he’d built for our benefit had evaporated into the heat, a flimsy ghost made of hot air and ten-dollar words, and all that was left was a common grifter with nowhere else to go.
