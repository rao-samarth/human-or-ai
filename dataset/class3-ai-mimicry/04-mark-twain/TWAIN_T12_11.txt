We were all gathered on Aunt Elspeth’s porch for her annual celebration of surviving another year, a feat which grew more impressive with each passing season, and the conversation was as peaceful as a sleeping hound. That is, until the subject of the old creek-bottom parcel came up between my cousins, Silas and Jebediah. Now, this was a miserable patch of land, good for raising rocks and little else, and for twenty years neither man would have traded a plug nickel for the whole consarned thing. But then some whisper got loose—a rumor about a railroad surveyor finding a seam of something valuable—and suddenly that useless dirt became a matter of profound principle. I sat there watching these two fellows, who’d shared a crib in their infancy, contort their faces and invent all manner of righteous claims; you’d have thought the Ten Commandments were chiseled on that bedrock, and each man was the sole prophet appointed to defend it. It does beat all, how the mere scent of a dollar can make a man forget every decent thing he ever knew.
