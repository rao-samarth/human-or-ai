The clock on the mantel had struck three, an hour so disreputable even the mice had retired for the evening, and yet here I was, candle in hand, on a crusade against a sound. It was a tiny click, a faint and irregular *tick-tack* that had begun its campaign against my sanity somewhere around suppertime. At first, I had dismissed it as the house settling—the idle musings of a loose shutter. But now, confound it, the noise had taken on a personality; a sly and conniving little demon residing in the walls, who knew precisely when I was on the verge of sleep before launching its next attack. I had already dismantled half the parlor and pried at a floorboard until my fingers were raw, all to no avail. A man can endure war, and pestilence, and even a three-hour sermon, but subject him to a persistent, unknowable noise in the dead of night, and you will find the very bedrock of his reason ground down to a fine and useless dust.
