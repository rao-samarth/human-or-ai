Amos shuffled back to his high stool, his face the color of spoiled milk, and he wouldn't meet my eye for a good long spell. He just fiddled with a blotter, pushing it back and forth like it was the most perplexing conundrum a man ever faced. I knew well enough what old Abernathy had been up to in that private office of his; he’d been sharpening an axe and looking for a convenient neck to try it on, and the books for that disastrous shipping venture had my signature scrawled all over them just as much as Amos's. "He offer you my position, did he?" I asked, keeping my voice low. Amos flinched, a sure-fire confession right there. "He said a man has to look out for his own prospects," he mumbled, finally looking up. "And I told him," Amos said, his voice finding a bit of iron in it, "that a man's prospects ain't worth a plugged nickel if he has to sell out the fellow who taught him how to calculate 'em."
