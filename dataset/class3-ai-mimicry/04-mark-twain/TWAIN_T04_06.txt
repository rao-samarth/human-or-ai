Henderson sat there behind my old desk—for it was his desk now, along with the title on the door—looking as sanctimonious as a deacon caught raiding the collection plate. He tried to muster a look of solemn regret, but his eyes had the triumphant glitter of a squirrel who’s just buried the last nut of the season. A fellow’s word, I’d always reckoned, was a kind of currency; some men dealt in gold, others in lead, but Henderson, it turned out, printed his on tissue paper, good for one use before it dissolved in the first sign of rain. He’d jawed on for five minutes about “difficult positions” and “unavoidable choices,” which is the high-toned way of saying he’d traded my hide for a bit of company advancement. It’s a perplexing thing, to see a man you thought was forged from solid iron reveal himself to be nothing more than tin, and cheap tin at that, the kind that rusts at the first hint of damp. I just looked at him, the new king on his rickety throne, and wondered what the devil he'd trade next.
