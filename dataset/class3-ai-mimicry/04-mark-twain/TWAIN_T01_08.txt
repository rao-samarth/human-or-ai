Young Silas Abernathy was explaining his particular brand of progress, which amounted to a proprietary scheme for squeezing old Mr. Henderson clean out of the dry-goods business. "Once that old man's deed is in my pocket," Silas declared to the porch at large, "there won't be another yard of calico sold between here and the capital that I don't get a piece of!" Jedediah Miller, who'd been carving a piece of pine into something that looked suspiciously like a complaint, paused his knife and directed a brown stream of commentary toward a nearby dust patch. "A man can build himself a mighty fine house that way, Silas," he said, not looking up. "The finest in the county, I've no doubt. But I reckon it’s a lonesome and drafty sort of business, being the only fellow left with the good sense—or the gall—to rattle around inside it all by himself." Silas puffed up his chest to reply, but no sound came out; it seemed the conundrum had caught in his throat.
