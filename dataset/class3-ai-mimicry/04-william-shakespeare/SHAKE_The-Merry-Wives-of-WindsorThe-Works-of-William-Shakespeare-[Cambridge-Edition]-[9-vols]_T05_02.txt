That grievous clamour which so long had vexed our lanes and fields is now a slumbering thing, and in its stead a solemn quietness hath fallen. No proclamation from a high seat commanded it; nay, nor any captain's call to arms did forge this fragile peace. It came instead as a winter mist, creeping from each heart that had grown weary of its own bitterness. Here, a hand is lent to right a fence that spite had overthrown; there, two souls who once with venom spoke now share a silent cup beside the hearth. This is a mending born not of victory, but of a shared and profound exhaustion. We labour not for glory, but with the hollowed gaze of men who have looked too long into the abyss of their own making, and seek only that the coming night may find our humble cottages alight with some small, recovered grace.
