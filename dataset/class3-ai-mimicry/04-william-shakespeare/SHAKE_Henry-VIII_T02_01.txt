For the Bishop, who doth claim God's very breath for his own speech, hath commanded that a tenth part of the coming harvest be given unto his holy coffers for the mending of men's souls. Yet the King's own man, who rode hither but yestereve with a seal of wax and a sword of steel, proclaimed all such levy belongs to the Crown alone, a sovereign right, and that he who gives a groat unto the cloth commits a treason against the throne. Thus did God's law make war upon the King's, and the King's decree did spit upon the altar. The reeve gazed at the barley, whose golden heads bowed to a wind that knew no master, a wind that whispered of two great serpents coiled 'round his parish, each promising salvation, and each threatening a mortal sting should he choose amiss.
