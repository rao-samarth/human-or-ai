I spur my horse across these barren moors, thinking to outpace the fiend that dogs my every step; yet, he is a swifter rider still. Though the landscape alters with each league, and foreign stars wheel overhead in unfamiliar skies, the geography of my own mind remains a fixed and desolate country. This foul companion whispers recollections in the howling of the wind, and in the quiet of an inn, its voice doth grow to a roar that deafens all repose. What use is it to change one's clime or company, when the most accursed judge and jury makes its court within mine own breast? Alas, a man may flee the jurisdiction of a king, or hide himself from the vengeance of his foes, but from the tyranny of what his own hand hath wrought, there is no sanctuary, no border he may cross to find a lasting peace. He carries his own gaol about with him, and the mind is a cell from which there can be no escape.
