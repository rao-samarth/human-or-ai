O, what a strange and cruel alchemy doth this long road work upon a faithful bond, to turn its gold to leaden silence! For since his eyes did first fall upon that lady in the tavern three nights hence, my sworn companion hath become a stranger to me, though we share this very dust and air. He prattles on of her bright wit and gentle form, a litany of praise I know too well, for 'tis the self-same prayer my own heart hath long kept secret. Each word of his honest adoration is a fresh wound to my soul, and I must feign a brother's joy whilst envy, that green-eyed fiend, doth gnaw upon my spirit. I look upon his face, once a comfort and a mirror to my own, and see naught but the architect of my coming sorrow. Wherefore did fortune place the same desire in two hearts that once beat as one, if not to prove that the truest league of men is but a fragile thing, so easily unmade by a woman’s glance?
