Mark you, my lord, the most perilous road to Hell is oft paved, not with sin, but with the purest dreams of Heaven. For when a man conceives a perfect world, a commonwealth of such flawless reason that it shames our own poor, stumbling state, he looks upon his fellow men not as brothers, but as misshapen clay to be remade in his image. He sees their vices, their petty loyalties, their very freedoms, as cankers upon the body politic that must be excised. And what surgeon's tool doth he employ for such a task? Why, 'tis the sword, the fire, the headsman's block. He who would build a new Jerusalem upon the earth must first clear the ground, and in his righteous haste, he mistakes the cries of men for the groaning of old timbers. So his utopia is founded not on virtue, but on graves, and the glorious dawn he promised brings only the shadow of the gallows.
