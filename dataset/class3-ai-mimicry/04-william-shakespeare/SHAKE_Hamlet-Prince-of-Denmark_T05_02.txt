Let us not then despair when the day’s golden eye doth close, for its setting is but a solemn promise of the dawn. So, too, is our own brief hour upon this turning stage; we are as the season's flower, which, having lent its sweetness to the air, must at last shed its weary petals to the soil. And wherefore should we call this fate a sorrow? For in that quiet earth lies the firm hope of another spring, the sleeping promise of a life renewed. This final slumber is no cruel tyrant come to steal our breath, but a gentle husbandman who gathers in his crop when it is ripe. The very knowledge of this timely harvest makes each sunlit moment dearer still, and in this grand design, which holds both cradle and the grave, we may find a most profound and wondrous peace.
