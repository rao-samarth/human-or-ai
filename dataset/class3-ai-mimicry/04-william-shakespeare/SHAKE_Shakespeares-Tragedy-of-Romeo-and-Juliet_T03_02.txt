By the guttering candle's light, I survey this kingdom of my own unmaking, a chamber grown vast with a new and dreadful quiet. What poison works so fast as a word let fly in haste, loosed from the tongue ere reason could lay its gentle hand upon the heart? A moment's choler, a brief and fiery storm within the soul, hath wrecked the peace of many seasons, and for its fleeting satisfaction, I have paid with all my store of warmth. The shadows lengthen on the floor, stretching like the long and barren road I now must walk alone. For that one unthinking stroke, that single, brutish sound that cannot be recalled, I have purchased this profound and lasting stillness; a silence that answers not, nor forgives, but merely is, and ever shall be, my most constant companion in this cold house.
