Alas, what ruin hath our stubbornness begot! The greybeards, whose long service lent them a grave authority, did counsel for the proven way, the path well-trod and safe from peril. Yet the young bloods, their minds afire with novel arts and nimble reckonings, cried out against such slow delay, calling our seasoned prudence naught but the brittle rust of age. In this most bitter strife of years against days, the very pillars of our common house were rent asunder. We would not bend to their rash haste, and they would not be bridled by our caution. Now all is dust and acrimony; our shared venture lies a corpse upon the floor, a grievous monument to the pride that pits the father's certainty against the son's ambition. What future could be built upon so fractured a stone? None, save one of sorrow and a most profound regret.
