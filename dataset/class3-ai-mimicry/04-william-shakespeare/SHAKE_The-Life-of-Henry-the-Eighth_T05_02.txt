So this is the prize for which all my striving was ordained; this cold seat of governance, this lonely summit built upon the bones of better men. My own father’s countenance, which once did shine a guiding light upon my labours, now watches me with a stranger’s judgement from the gilded frame upon the wall. He hath bequeathed this heavy realm, this ledger-book of souls, yet in the giving, something of his heart was kept aside. What of poor Alistair, my truest friend in all the world, whose counsel I forsook to gain this place? His ruin was the final rung upon the ladder I have climbed, and now I stand alone to hear the hollow wind whisper of my faithless victory. They call this power, this empty inheritance of command; but I say it is a crown of lead, a gilded cage wherein my conscience must henceforth pace and fret until my days be done.
