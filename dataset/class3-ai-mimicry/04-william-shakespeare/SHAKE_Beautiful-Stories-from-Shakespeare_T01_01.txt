Hark, what a marvel is our Master Finch, who, from a humble stall selling naught but salt and common thread, hath raised himself to govern our entire market square. Some do whisper of foul play, of ledgers cunningly writ and a rival’s good name poisoned by a rumour’s wicked breath; but I say this is the prattling of envious, idle tongues. For what is a man to do when he spies a town in want, held fast by sluggish merchants whose slow minds do naught but keep us all in a state of dusty slumber? A strong hand was needed, a mind that would not bend to the pleas of the weak nor the stale customs of our fathers. If a few paltry fortunes were undone to forge a greater prosperity for the whole, then 'twas a necessary physic, a bitter draught to cure a sickness of the soul. His great striving is the very sun that warms our commerce, and if it scorches a few who stand too near, why, they should have sought the shade.
