Behold yon magistrate, how the marketplace doth sing his name; his purse, ever open to the parish poor, hath bought him a saint’s repute amongst these simple folk. Yet I, a moment hence, did spy him in the alley’s gloom, where no eye but Heaven’s and mine own could mark his true employ. What venom did he spit upon the wretched boy who'd but stumbled at his feet, and with what a cold and killing look did he deny the waif a farthing for a crust! He shows the sun a visage of gilded piety, a countenance of charity itself, but in the shade a serpent's heart beats secret in his breast. Are all men fashioned thus, to wear their virtue like a player’s mask, doff’d when the crowd’s applause grows faint? This doubt doth plague my soul, for if the fairest-seeming apple be but poison at the core, what hope remains for common, earthy stock?
