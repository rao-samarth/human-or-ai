You ask why my heart doth swell so, why a tear unbidden starts when I but hear our distant anthem sung upon this foreign shore. 'Tis no simple matter of the soil, sir, nor of the sovereign who holds the sceptre, though his reign be just. Nay, it is a fire in the blood, a spirit that binds the lowest beggar to the loftiest lord with a thread unseen, yet stronger than forged iron. When our people stand as one, a thousand private griefs are made as naught, and a singular, mighty pulse doth beat throughout the land, a rhythm felt from the storm-tossed coast to the quietest country vale. This feeling, this sacred communion, is a fortress against all despair; it is the common soul of our kindred, a bulwark against the turning of a hostile world. To forsake such a bond? I would sooner cut the tongue from mine own mouth, for then I should be truly speechless, a man without a country and without a name.
