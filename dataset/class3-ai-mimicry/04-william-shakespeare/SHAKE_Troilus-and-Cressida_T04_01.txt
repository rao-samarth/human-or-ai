My lord father sat at the head of the feasting table, a brittle king in his own hall, whilst my brother, with a merchant’s hurried tongue, did press the parchment upon him. This document, full of gilded words, promised a future built from the dust of our own past; it bid us pull down these very stones, these walls that knew our grandsire’s youth, for some new and fleeting enterprise. The old man said naught, his gaze fixed upon the hearth where the great mantel-beam, once a forest’s pride, now showed the gnawing of a hundred winters. He saw, I think, what I did see: that the slow siege of the years had already doomed this house. What power have we to halt this patient thief, who steals the mortar from the stone and the strength from a good man’s bones? To sign the page is but to name the day of the execution, for the sentence was long since passed.
