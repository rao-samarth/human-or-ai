By the guttering candle's light, he sat alone, his own shadow a monstrous giant thrown against the wall. He swore he saw it stir, a twitch of some unholy life where none should be; and in that instant, his very reason seemed to quake upon its throne. For who can say where the true world ends and the mind’s foul pageant begins? This malady of seeing what is not, or not seeing what is plain, doth make a mockery of a man’s judgment, turning his own thoughts to traitors in his head. One man sees a ghost and is deemed mad, whilst another sees God’s own angels and is called a saint; yet both have spurned the solid earth for visions their fellows cannot share. Perchance the truest lunacy is to trust our senses overmuch, for they are but fickle windows in this prison of the skull, and what they show is oft a distorted, tricksome play.
