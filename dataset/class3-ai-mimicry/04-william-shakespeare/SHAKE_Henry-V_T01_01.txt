Think'st thou this mantle sits so light upon my shoulders? You see the bowing heads, the feasting hall, the gleam of gold, but I feel naught save the crushing weight of ten thousand souls whose fates are tethered to my own. What rest have I, when every creak of the floorboards at midnight sounds a traitor's footstep, and every petition brought at dawn brings some new and insoluble grief? You covet this chair, this circlet of command? Then you covet a sleepless torment, a constant war fought not with swords but within the confines of a single, weary mind. Each choice is a branching path to ruin for some, to fortune for others, and I alone must walk the blade's edge betwixt them. This power you so envy, my friend, is but a splendid poison, which a man must drink each day anew, praying it does not kill him ere the sun sets.
