Pray, look me in the eye and tell me true, what manner of man art thou behind that mask of courtesy? You smile, and bow, and speak in honey'd words, as if your heart were made of nought but summer's kindness; yet I have seen the serpent's glint within your gaze when you suppose no eye doth watch you. This outward piety, this saintly show, is but a player's robe to cloak a fouler purpose. O, what a wretched age we live in, when the basest coin is gilded to resemble gold, and a man's true substance must be guess'd at, like a riddle in the dark. A smiling villain is a plague upon the soul, for his poison is serv'd in a golden cup, and we drink deep of our own ruin, thanking him for his good fellowship. How shall we trust the sun, when even a man's face can lie so well?
