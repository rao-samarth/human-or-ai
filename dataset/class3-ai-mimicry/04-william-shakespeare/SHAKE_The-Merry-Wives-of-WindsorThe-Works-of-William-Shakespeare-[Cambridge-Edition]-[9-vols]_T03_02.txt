Hark, how the midnight silence doth mock my fury! I have seen this night how they live, these lords of gilded ease, who speak in honeyed lies and whose promises are but vapours on a winter's morn. Their very laughter is a coin, spent to purchase another's ruin; their honour, a silken cloak to hide a leprous soul. What is their noble blood but a river of corruption, flowing from some poisoned spring of old? Nay, give me the honest callouses upon my hand, the simple bread we earn with sweat and care, for this plain life, this humble roof, holds more true grace than all their palaces. We sleep with conscience for a pillow, whilst they, I think, must court their slumber with a draught of wine, lest their own foul deeds should rise as spectres in the dark.
