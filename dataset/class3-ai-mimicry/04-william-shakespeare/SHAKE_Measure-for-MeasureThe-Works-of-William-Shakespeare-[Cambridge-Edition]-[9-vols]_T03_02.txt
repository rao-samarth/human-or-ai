Pray, mark how these great personages do strut and preen, their virtues worn like costly jewels for all the world to praise. Each bows to righteousness and speaks of honour as if it were the very air they breathe; yet their piety is but a mask, a painted semblance for the public stage. In the shadow, where no eye doth watch but heaven's, their principles do bend and warp to suit the shape of their desires. A poor man's fault is judged a monstrous crime, whilst their own greater sins, cloaked in wealth and high position, are styled as mere necessity or some trick of fortune. Thus is justice made a fool, and what we call our moral compass proves to be a needle ever trembling, pointing not to truth, but to the greater hoard of gold and gain. Forsooth, a man’s goodness is oft but a performance, his conscience a fickle courtier that serves ambition first and truth a distant second, if at all.
