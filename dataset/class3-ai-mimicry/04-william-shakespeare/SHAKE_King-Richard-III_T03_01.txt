The carriage jolted, and my lord clutched the heavy purse, its coin the cold price of a friend's ruin. Wherefore did his heart now play the coward? He had won the day, secured his lands, and left his rival to the crows. Yet as he peered through the thick glass, he saw the sky turn a most unnatural bruised purple; the heavens themselves seemed to scowl upon his journey. A sudden wind, like a hangman's gasp, did rattle the frame, and he thought not of his new-gotten wealth but of the final ledger where all such deeds are writ. For though a man may hide his blackest sins from the eyes of his fellows, and purchase silence with his ill-got gold, he cannot bribe the storm nor pay the thunder to hold its tongue. The all-seeing firmament keeps its own counsel, and its sentence, when it falls, shall be as sudden and as absolute as the lightning's flash.
