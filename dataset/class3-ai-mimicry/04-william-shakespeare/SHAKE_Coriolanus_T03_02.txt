Mark how the common heart, so lately bruised and hardened by some fault, now swells with a sudden tide of praise for the very man they scorned. But yesterday, this mason’s name was a curse upon their lips; his very shadow shunned in the lane as a mark of failure. Now, what a blessed turning of the wind! They gaze upon his new-wrought arch, a thing of grace and honest skill, and all past errors are forgot, washed clean as if by a sudden spring rain. Some would call this easy turning a weakness, a feather-headed fancy; yet I see in it a greater, hopeful virtue. For is not a soul that can so readily amend its judgement a soul still tender and alive? 'Tis a spirit not set like mortar by old grudges, but one that, like the good earth, welcomes the sun after a storm and gives forth green shoots once more.
