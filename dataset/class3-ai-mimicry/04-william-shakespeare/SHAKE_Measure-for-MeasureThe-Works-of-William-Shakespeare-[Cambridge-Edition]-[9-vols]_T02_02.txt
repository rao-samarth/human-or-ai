Observe the country magistrate, how piously he doth dispense the King's justice from the shade of his ancient oak. To hear him speak, one would swear that Truth herself had lent him her own tongue, for he speaks with such grave measure of right and of duty, chiding the sinner with a father's sigh and praising the righteous with a tear in his eye. Yet this performance, forsooth, is but a clever pageant for the simple folk. Let a wealthy landowner but whisper in his ear, and a widow's rightful claim to a field becomes a tangled folly; a poor man's honest testimony is deemed naught but the raving of a fool. His pronouncements are not carved in the stone of law but writ upon the shifting sands of promised coin, and the scales he holds so high for all to see are tipped by the unseen weight of a heavy, golden purse.
