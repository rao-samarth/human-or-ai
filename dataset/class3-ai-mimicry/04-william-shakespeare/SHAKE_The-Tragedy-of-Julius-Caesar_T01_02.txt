Alas, what wretched crossroads is this, where my sworn duty and my soul's own virtue must take such different paths? My lord, to whom I pledged my very life upon a hallowed blade, now bids me ride forth and be the instrument of such a wicked enterprise. He calls it service; my own heart cries out that it is naught but blackest sin. To disobey is to be branded traitor, a faithless dog unworthy of his keep, and every man of worth shall shun my countenance. Yet to fulfill this charge, to see this damning errand through unto its end—that is to poison the wellspring of mine own repute and live hereafter as a man whose honour is but a hollow, mocking ghost. This heavy cloak of loyalty, once my greatest pride, feels now a shroud that smothers what is right, and I am lost upon this road with no true star to guide me home.
