Here, amidst the gentle slumber of the fields, a man might think the world itself at peace, yet even in this quietude, I receive foul tidings from the city. The great lords, in their gilded halls, feast and make merry, believing their high station a fortress built by God himself. They see not the hunger in the eyes of the commons, nor hear the muttering that gathers like a foul humour in the body politic. For what is a kingdom but a house divided? The master in his chamber scoffs at the groans from below, yet the foundations are laid in common earth, and when that earth doth tremble, the highest turret is the first to fall. I fear a sickness spreads, a discontent that, once it takes root in the hearts of the many, shall shake the estates of the few to their very core, and all this painted finery will prove but a poor shield against a people's wrath.
