Observe yon lord, how he doth move through this great hall with a courtier’s grace, his courtesies as smooth as polished stone; yet his mirth is but a painted mask for the canker within. He that hunts a grievance finds his own soul becomes the forest, dark and tangled, wherein he loses his own path. The memory of a wrong, when held too close, doth sour the blood and make a poison of all honest feeling, until a man’s whole substance is consumed by the fire he wishes for his foe. To pay a debt of malice is to make oneself a debtor to corruption, for the mind becomes a narrow chamber, echoing with but one hateful purpose. In his careful study of his enemy’s ruin, he has architected his own, building a monument to a past injury whilst the present good of his life falls to dust about him, unnoticed.
