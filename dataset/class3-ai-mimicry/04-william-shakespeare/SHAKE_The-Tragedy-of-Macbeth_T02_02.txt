The road doth cleave itself in twain, a serpent’s forked tongue laid upon the dust, and I am brought to a sudden halt, a man betwixt two futures. A crone in the last village spake of ruin should I take this leftward path, a doom she read in shifting smoke and brittle bone. Yet my very soul, a mutinous captain warring with my reason, cries out for that shadowed lane, for duty calls me there to face a sworn foe. Is this my moment, then, to fashion my own end, or is the choosing but a player's scene, its final line already writ by some unseen hand? To turn my horse toward the sunlit hill is wisdom, and the long life promised me. But what is life, if I must live a coward, haunted by the ghost of an oath unkept? Nay, I shall spur my steed into the gloom, and by that very act decide if I am master of my days, or but the fool preordained.
