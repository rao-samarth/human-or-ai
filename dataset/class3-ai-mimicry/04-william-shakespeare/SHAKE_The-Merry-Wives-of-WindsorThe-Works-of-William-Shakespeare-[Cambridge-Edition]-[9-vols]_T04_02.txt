The candle sputters low, and with it, my resolve doth flicker in this heavy dark. By morning’s light, I am to stand before the court and spin a lie, a cunning fiction woven with but threads of what is true, to snare a man whose sins are blacker than this very night. I must swear I saw him turn to the west, though his path went east; that his words were soft, when in truth they were a serpent’s hiss. Doth my soul cry foul at such a mask of verity? Perchance it doth. Yet, when plain honesty serves only as a shield for villainy, and truth itself is gagged and bound by a tyrant’s purse, what recourse hath a man but to play the knave for a righteous end? Let them call me forsworn, so long as justice, by whatever crooked road, at last arrives.
