Hark, what a brittle thing is a man’s good name, and how easily it is cracked by the malice of a wagging tongue! I have for thirty years walked these same city stones with a straight back and an honest purse, earning by slow degrees the respect you once so freely gave. My word was my bond, my handshake a sealed contract writ in faith. But one false whisper, one venomous tale born of envy in some dark alley, hath flown through these streets like a pestilence, and now I see doubt in the eyes that once held trust. This stain, good sirs, is of a devilish kind; it cannot be scoured away with reason, nor washed clean with all the tears of innocence. For though the lie be slain and proven false a thousand times, its ghost shall forever haunt my name, and men will say, “There goes the one of whom that wicked story was once told.” Thus, a lifetime of virtue is made the poor fool of a moment’s slander.
