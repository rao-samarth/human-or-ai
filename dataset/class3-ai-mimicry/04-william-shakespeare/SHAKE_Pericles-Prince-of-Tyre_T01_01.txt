Hark how the rustics rail against the sky when a sudden frost doth bite their budding vines, calling it a cruel judgement on their souls; yet these same men, when a gentle sun ripens their grain to gold, praise their own sweat and pious toil for the bounty. This world turns upon no axis of deserts or just rewards, but rather on a giddy pivot of sheerest chance. The shadow that falls upon my gate today will tomorrow stretch its long and gloomy finger toward my neighbour's door, and I shall feel the sun again. Thus, I do not weep when my cup is empty, nor boast too loudly when it overflows, for I have seen the beggar mount a lord's own horse, and I have seen a lord trudge barefoot in the mud. 'Tis all one motion, a tide that ebbs and flows, and he is the greatest fool who thinks his own small anchor can hold it fast.
