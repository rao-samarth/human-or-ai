As we journey, I oft reflect how this world is made and unmade by mere breath. A king’s edict, writ with careful ink and sealed with wax, can alter the course of a thousand lives ere the sun hath set; yet that same edict is but air given form, a notion given a most potent voice. So too can a sly rumour, born of no father but envy, travel faster than any royal courier and do such mischief as a legion of armed men could not contrive. We think we act upon the solid ground of circumstance, yet in truth, we are ever steered by these unseen currents of speech, mistaking the chart for the sea itself. The fates of kingdoms, therefore, are not decided by the sword alone, but are first spoken into being, for good or ill, with the simple and most perilous magic of the tongue.
