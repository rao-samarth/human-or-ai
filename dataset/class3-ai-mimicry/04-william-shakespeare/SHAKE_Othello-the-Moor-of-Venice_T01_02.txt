My dearest friend, you ask after our reunion, yet I must confess a bitter humour poisons all this goodly cheer. Pray, mark how our cousin sits, his face a stony counterfeit of joy whilst his own brother is lauded by our grandsire. A thin and brittle smile he wears, yet in his eyes there burns a feverish light, a malady of the spirit that finds offence in another's grace. This worm of discontent, I fear, hath burrowed deep into his soul; it feeds upon his brother's triumphs and turns them to its own foul sustenance, leaving him hollowed out within. He sees no mirth in this assembly, no love in these familiar bonds, for the whole world is but a glass wherein he sees his own imagined want, and thus a brother's happiness becomes his most profound and private misery.
