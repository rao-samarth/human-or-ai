Mark you that fellow by the fountain, whose feet seem rooted to the very stones? A simple choice, I warrant, confronts him: to turn toward the mercer's, or down toward the docks. Yet see how his visage is o'erhung with a deliberation fit for a king's council. He hath, within his own mind, raised such a parliament of possibilities, each arguing its case with subtle reason, that the simple motion of a single step is now a matter of grave and weighty import. And so the vital colour of a ready purpose is made wan and bloodless by the constant turning of the inward wheel; the grandest enterprise, and the least, doth find its sinews cut by this excess of caution. His will, which should be the captain of his limbs, is made a thrall to the mutinous counsel of his own wit, and he shall stand there, perchance, till nightfall, a perfect statue of a choice unmade.
