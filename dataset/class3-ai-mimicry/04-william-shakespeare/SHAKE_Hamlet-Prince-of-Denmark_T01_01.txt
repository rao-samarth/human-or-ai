My dearest kin, draw near and mark my words, for they are the bitter fruit of a life ill-spent. A grievous wrong was done to me, you know it well; a wound so deep it cried out for a balm of equal pain upon its author. And so I set my course. I gave myself wholly to this dark pursuit, thinking justice my compass and my righteous guide. But this fever for a reckoning, it doth burn away all that is good within a man’s heart. It maketh his sleep a torment of grim plots and turns his daily bread to ash in his mouth. In nursing my own injury, I became the very image of my foe, my own visage twisted by the same choler that first damned him. I sought to quench a fire with oil, and have but made a greater conflagration of my own soul. Look upon me: I have had my satisfaction, and yet I am a hollowed thing, a ghost at my own feast. Let this be your lesson, ere you too trade your peace for the empty prize of a balanced scale.
