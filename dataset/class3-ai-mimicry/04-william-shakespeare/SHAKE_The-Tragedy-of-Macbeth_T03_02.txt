Mark how the senior clerk, with spectacles perched upon his solemn nose, doth pore upon his ledger as if it were a holy text. The guild master praises his unceasing diligence, whilst lesser men whisper of his piety, noting how his thin lips move in silent prayer even as his quill records their profits and their losses. They see an anchor of a man, a fixed and honest point in a turning world of trade. Yet were their sight so keen to pierce the veil of custom and regard, they would spy the truth that festers in the ink: that with each careful stroke he shaves a phantom sliver for himself, his quiet prayers not to any god in heaven but to the growing idol of his secret coffers. His sober coat is but the costume for his greed, and the stage whereon he plays the part of loyal servant is built with planks of pure deceit.
