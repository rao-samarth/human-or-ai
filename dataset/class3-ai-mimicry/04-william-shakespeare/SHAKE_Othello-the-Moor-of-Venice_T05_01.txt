Heed me not, cousin, for I speak but madness to the wind, yet I must speak it. His vows, which once did seem as constant as the northern star, are now but shifting shadows, cast by a tongue too skilled in artifice. What I held for purest truth he hath so cunningly reshaped into a weapon against my own poor sense, making me doubt the very ground on which I stand. He praises my devotion, yet in the same breath shows it to be a simpleton’s folly; he doth profess a love as deep as the sea, yet uses its tides to pull my reason under. O, how can a heart so freely given be made a stranger to itself? This sacred bond I cherished, which felt a fortress built on honest stone, I now perceive is but a house of painted cards, and I fear the slightest whisper of his next deceit shall bring it tumbling down to ruin.
