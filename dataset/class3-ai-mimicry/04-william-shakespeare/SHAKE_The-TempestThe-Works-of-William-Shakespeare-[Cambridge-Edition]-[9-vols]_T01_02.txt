I watch my cousin pour a cup for the very man who, a year past, did slander his good name, and I marvel, forsooth, at this strange alchemy of the heart. For I myself have known the hot desire to answer injury with injury, to keep a score of slights and pay them back with bitter interest. To nurse a wrong is to keep a serpent in one’s bosom; it bites none but its master and turns all his blood to gall. Vengeance is a bitter draught, a fleeting meal that leaves the soul yet hungrier than before. But look you there, at the quiet peace that settles now between them. A simple word of pardon hath drawn the venom forth, and in its place grows a fellowship that seems a feast to nourish them for all seasons to come. Such a balm is a rarer and more precious thing than any sharp-edged justice sought in anger.
