Observe him there, shouldering his way through the market's press, a man who feigns a will as solid as the cobblestones beneath his boots. Forsooth, a noble fellow, you might think, one whose mind is his own kingdom. But what a paltry kingdom it is, whose every law was writ by another’s hand! He speaks, and ‘tis his mother’s judgment that gives the words their shape; he scowls, and ‘tis her ancient prejudice that furrows his brow. Each gesture, each pious pronouncement on the sins of this bawling city, is naught but a performance for an audience of one, a sainted matriarch who holds the strings of his very soul from afar. He is her masterpiece of obedience, a son so perfectly fashioned in her image that he hath forgotten the feel of his own marrow, mistaking the gilded cage for the freedom of the sky.
