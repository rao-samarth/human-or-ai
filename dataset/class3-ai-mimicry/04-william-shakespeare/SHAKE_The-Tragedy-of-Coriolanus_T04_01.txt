Prithee, friend, lower thy voice and mark this common throng, for there is no beast more perilous. See how they cheer the very man they would have stoned but yesterday, their throats raw with a praise that tomorrow turns to curses. Their love is a cheap wine, quick to sour; their judgment, a feather tossed upon a gale. They are a great and witless ocean, calm enough to bear a noble ship one hour, yet in the next, without reason save their own churning whim, they will rise in a furious tempest to splinter its timbers upon the shore. One whispered lie, one clever word from a self-serving tongue, and this assembly of seeming men becomes a single, ravenous mouth, devoid of conscience and hungry for ruin. Trust not their roar of acclaim, for the same breath that lifts a hero to the sky may fashion the rope for his gallows.
