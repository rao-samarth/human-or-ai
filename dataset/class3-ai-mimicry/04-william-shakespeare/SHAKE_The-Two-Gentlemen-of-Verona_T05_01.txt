Hark, what sweet folly doth seize a young man’s soul amidst the city’s clamorous throng! He, who but yester-morn saw only cobblestones and cart-wheels, now perceives a heaven in the street where his fancy walks. A thousand souls may pass, a riot of colour and noise, yet his senses are tuned to but one gentle voice, one fleeting shape. A casual glance from her window is to him a sunbeam, promising a summer’s bliss; a dropped handkerchief, a sacred relic to be cherished. This fever, this pleasant madness, though it build its castles upon the air and see a queen in a common maid, is no true sickness. Nay, for 'tis the very schooling of the heart, a blessed lunacy that teaches it how to beat for another, and in so doing, prepares it for a truer, wiser love that time will later bring.
