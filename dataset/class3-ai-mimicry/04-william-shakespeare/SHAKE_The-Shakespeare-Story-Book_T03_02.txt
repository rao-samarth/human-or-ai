Pray, mark the butcher's wife, how she bestows her alms upon the poor with such a gentle hand, her lips forming blessings as if she were a sainted mother to this wretched town. A most holy visage, is it not? Forsooth, her charity doth cost her naught, for I know well the heavy thumbs she puts upon the scales when weighing out the commoner's meat, and those very blessings are but whispers to disguise the coin she clips from every shilling. She paints her soul with virtue's colours, yet the canvas underneath is rotten through, a thing of such base avarice it would make a devil blush, though here it walks in sunlight and doth smile upon its neighbours. She is praised for a lamb, when in her heart there lurks a wolf that feeds on the very flock she pretends to shepherd.
