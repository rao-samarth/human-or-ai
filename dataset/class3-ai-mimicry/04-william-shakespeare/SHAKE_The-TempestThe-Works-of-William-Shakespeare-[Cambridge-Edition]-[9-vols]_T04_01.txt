My cousin speaks aright; our good uncle is much changed, and not for the better part. I mark how he, who once sought counsel and laughed at his own follies, now sits enthroned amidst his kin as if they were but subjects to his whim. His word, which was a friendly guide, hath become a law writ in stone, and he mistakes our silence for agreement when it is naught but the prudent quiet of a lesser power before a greater. He measures his own wisdom by the obedience he commands, and finds himself the sagest man alive. Wherefore should he bend his ear to reason, when his own will serves him for a perfect argument? Thus, the man who governs all, and is by none governed, loses the truest governance of all: that which he should keep upon himself, and which, being lost, leaves him but a tyrant in his own house.
