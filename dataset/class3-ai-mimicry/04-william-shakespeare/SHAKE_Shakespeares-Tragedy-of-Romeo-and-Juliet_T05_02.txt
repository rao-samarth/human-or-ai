What bitter strife is this, that sets the seasoned hand against the swift new blood within these very walls? The elder, whose long years have bent his back o’er ledgers true, doth see his careful reckoning cast aside for some new, fever’d art of sums that promises a fortune ere the moon doth change her face. He pleads for temperance, for the slow and proven way, but his is a voice lost in the clamorous haste of youth, who, deeming age a palsy and its wisdom dust, do rush headlong toward a gilded prize. They see a rival in the grey-thatched head, not mentor; a hindrance, not a guide. And so, in this most unnatural war where experience is branded folly, the foundations of the enterprise are rent asunder, and all sink in the ruin that their discord hath so blindly wrought.
