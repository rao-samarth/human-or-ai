Pray, tell me, friend, what think you of this fading light?" the younger man asked, his gaze fixed upon the horizon where the sun bled its final colours into the clouds. "This world, which at noon seemed so solid and so true, now doth play the counterfeit; yon simple hill wears a phantom's crown of fire, and the very dust upon the road is spun of golden thread. Are we not walking through a player's scene, where all we touch is but a painted cloth?" His companion grunted, pulling his cloak tighter against the coming chill. "I think that yonder light is dying, and with it our hope of a warm bed if we linger upon such fancies. Whether cloth or stone, the inn's door will feel the same to my fist, and its ale will be no dream to my throat. Leave such thoughts for sleep, where they properly belong.
