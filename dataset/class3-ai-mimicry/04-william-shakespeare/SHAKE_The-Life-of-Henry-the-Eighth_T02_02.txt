The old man waved a dismissive hand, the great rings upon it glinting in the candlelight. "You prattle on of equity as if it were some fixed and northern star, by which all men might steer their course aright. But mark me well; the law is but a great and cumbersome cloak, fashioned to be worn by those with shoulders broad enough to bear its cost. A poor man, caught in its folds, is smothered for his pains, whilst a man of substance may turn and twist the garment to his liking, making of its solemn edicts a shield against his foes or a mantle for his own ambition. The very ink that writes the verdict is oft mixed with the gold of the victor, and the judge’s solemn pronouncements are but echoes of a whisper first spoken in his private ear. So cease this boyish pleading for what ought to be, and learn to see the world for what it is: a stage where consequence is bought, and innocence is merely the plea of a man who cannot pay the fee."
