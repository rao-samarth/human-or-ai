Hark, how the common folk of this humble town do praise their Magistrate, whose stately bearing and robes of office seem a very bulwark against all chaos; they see the gilded staff, the brow uncreased by doubt, and deem him a man of iron, forged in virtue’s fire. But what know they of the man within? What ken have they of the midnight hour, when that same staff lies cast aside, and the man, stripped of his gilded shell, doth wrestle with a craven heart that trembles at a mouse’s stir; his soul a wretched prisoner to fears he dare not speak aloud, lest the very walls betray his frailty to the dawn. Thus is the world oft-deceived, mistaking the player’s costly costume for the substance of the man he doth but feign to be, whilst true nobility may shiver in a beggar’s rags.
