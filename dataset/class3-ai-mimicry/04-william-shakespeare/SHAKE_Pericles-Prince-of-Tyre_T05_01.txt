Nay, speak not so. Think'st thou this bitter turn of fortune's wheel is spun by chance alone? I tell thee, friend, there is a greater hand at work, a will that shapes our ends when we ourselves have lost the thread. For every sorrow that doth plague our hearts, for every seeming victory of our foes, some high purpose is being writ in characters we cannot yet discern. We are but actors on a stage we did not build, and though the plot seems cruel and fraught with villainy, the author of it all doth see the justice in the final act. Our present grief is but a heavy stone placed in the path, to teach our stumbling feet a firmer way to tread toward what is yet to come; for the heavens, my lord, do play with us as they please, and oft use our despair to fashion our salvation.
