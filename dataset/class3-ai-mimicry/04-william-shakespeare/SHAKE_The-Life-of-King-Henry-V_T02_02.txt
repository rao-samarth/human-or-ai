Prithee, cousin, cease thy talk of glorious purpose and a name that shall echo in the halls of time. Such tales are but gilded songs for boys who have not yet seen a field turned to a butcher's yard. You speak of banners kissed by a hopeful sun; I see them trampled in the bloody mire, a shroud for some poor soul whose mother shall ne'er know his grave. This 'honour' you so cherish is a phantom, a whisper from a king's warm hearth whilst good men choke on dust and their own blood in some forgotten ditch. They promise a place in chronicles, a verse sung by minstrels. And what is that? A puff of air, a fleeting sound, for a life given o'er to the raven's feast and the deep silence of the earth. The only true harvest of the sword is a company of ghosts and a kingdom of widows.
