Upon this dusty road, where every traveler doth seek some common comfort at the day's weary end, I spied a man of darker hue than is our custom here. He sat apart, a solitary figure 'gainst the tavern's boisterous light, and though his coin was good as any man's, the innkeeper served him with a downcast eye and hurried hand. No soul would share his board, nor lend an ear to any word he might have spoken; they built a wall of silence round him, more cruel than any stone. He was an island in their sea of fellowship, a ghost unseen amongst the living, and his very presence seemed a crime for which he was already judged. Methought his loneliness was a cloak he wore, a shadow cast not by the sun, but by the coldness in their hearts, a darkness which no candle could ever hope to pierce.
