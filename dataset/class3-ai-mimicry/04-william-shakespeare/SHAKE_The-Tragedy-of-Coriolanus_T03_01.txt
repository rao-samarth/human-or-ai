You ask whence this shadow falls upon my countenance, you who sit in judgement in this common hall, and I shall not deny the cause. I confess I did give my assent to that which my own soul did abhor; a small concession, they named it, a trifle to smooth the path for some greater town-wide good. But what is a man, if not the sum of his own sworn verities? To chip one piece from the stone of his own character is to invite the chisel to crack the whole. They promised a season of plenty, a mended fence against our rivals, and for this I was to swallow a single, well-seasoned lie. Yet that morsel, once consumed, hath turned to bitter gall within my breast, for in saving the parish from a fleeting peril, I have perchance damned the truer part of myself. A good name, once sullied by such politic arts, can ne'er be scoured clean again, and I am left to wonder if the price of concord was not my very honour.
