The stillness of this chamber lends a false peace, for in my mind’s ear I hear it yet: that great and clamorous beast which calls itself the public. How easily its thousand throats did roar my name with praise ere noon, as if I were some new-crowned prince come to deliver them. Yet a single, sour-breathed rumour, a whisper passed from one fool to the next, was all it required to turn their garlanded acclaim to stones. What faith may be put in such a love, which dies upon a word? Their adoration is a summer's torrent, full of noise and fury, that by eventide becomes a shallow, muddy trickle, leaving naught behind but wreckage and regret. Better, I think, to be hated from the first than to be so loved, for their favour is a poison sweetened for a moment, and its end is ever bitter.
