Look you there, upon that barren hill, how the bones of a great house stand stark against the grey-weeping sky. A lord of some repute once held his revels in those halls, I warrant; a man whose command was the swift breath of life or death, and whose favour was a sun to warm the ambitions of lesser men. And for all his might, what is he now? A forgotten name, his sovereignty a feast for crows and creeping ivy. So it is with all who climb so high upon the world’s uncertain stage; they take the throne to be a mountain peak, unshakeable and firm, yet find it is but a wisp of cloud that the first ill wind of fortune doth tear asunder. They trust in loyalty that, like a summer garment, is cast off when the season turns, and wake to find their gilded scepter but a broken stick to fend off the wolves their own power has bred.
