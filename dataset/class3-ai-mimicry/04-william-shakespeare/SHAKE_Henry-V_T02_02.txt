Hark, how the city’s throat doth roar my name, and the air, thick with rose-petals and the commons’ shouts, proclaims me victor. They hoist me on their shoulders, a hero gilded by a sun I can no longer feel; for every cheer that strikes my ear, a brother’s dying whisper answers from the grave. What victory is this, when my mind’s eye sees not these smiling maids but the gape-mouthed horror of young Philip, his life-blood staining the foreign mud? They praise the sharp-edged steel that won the day, yet know not how it feels to sunder flesh from bone, nor see the vacant stare that follows after. Wherefore do they praise the harvest when they have not witnessed the bloody scythe that reaped it? This lauded triumph feels but a hollow, gilded cage, and I, its feted prisoner, must smile upon the throng whilst my soul doth scream for the quiet dark of oblivion.
