Amidst the ceaseless clamour of this city, where every soul doth cry out for some advantage, the mind finds little purchase for quiet contemplation. Yet even here I have observed the true nature of a grievance held too long within the breast. To nurse a wrong is to fashion for oneself a cage, gilded perchance with the promise of just satisfaction, but a cage nonetheless, from which the world appears a host of enemies. The man who plots his retribution becomes a shadow to his own life; his humours turn to gall, his every waking thought a servant to the past's dark injury. He walks these very streets, yet sees not the sun nor the merchant's honest smile, for his world is shrunk to a pin's-head of malice. What strength is there in this? Nay, 'tis a fever, not a force. The truer power, a balm of most surprising virtue, lies in the will to let such cankers go; to absolve the debt and thereby unburden one's own spirit, freeing it to walk once more in the common light, a citizen of the present hour.
