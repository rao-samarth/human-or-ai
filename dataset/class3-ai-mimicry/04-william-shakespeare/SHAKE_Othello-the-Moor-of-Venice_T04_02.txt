Burn it! Cast the wretched paper to the flames, I say, and let its foul ink turn to smoke! What good is a life of righteous deed, of loyal service to the crown, when a single lie, whispered in the dark by some envious coward, can undo it all in a night? See how quickly the poison spreads; they will read this filth in the market square by dawn, and the name that was my father's pride shall become a thing of mockery, a jester's punchline. My very worth, the sum of all my days, is now but a fragile glass, shattered by a churlish stone flung from the shadows. Nay, I will not abide it. Fetch my sword and my riding boots, for this slander shall not outlive the morning sun. We will hunt the serpent who writ this venom, and he shall learn what price is paid for murdering a man's good standing.
