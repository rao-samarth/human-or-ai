He speaks now of hard counsel and the turn of fortune, as if such hollow words could scour the stain from his forsworn heart. I mark him well, how his hands do plead a case his eyes cannot. What a brittle thing is a man’s sworn faith, a bond of breath spoken into the cold air and vanished ere the next sun doth rise. We write our allegiances in water and call them stone, swearing by the heavens that which the basest earthly greed can shatter in an instant. Doth he truly think me so dull a creature as to believe this new-forged truth? Nay, I see his protestation for what it is: a solemn promise is but a garment to be worn for a season, and when the fashion of a man’s ambition changes, it is cast off for a finer cloth without a moment’s thought for the cold it leaves behind.
