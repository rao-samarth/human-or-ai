Prithee, do not vex thy spirit over that proud fellow in his velvets, who struts as if the stones themselves should bow. He hath built his house on the sorrows of other men and sups on the wine of their ruin, thinking his great wealth a shield against all consequence. But what is gold against the slow and certain memory of the firmament? For there is an accounting that no earthly coin can settle, a judgment that waits not for a gavel’s fall but watches from beyond the stars, patient and unseen. Every wicked deed, every silent treason of the heart, is but a debt deferred. He may prosper for his season, yet the scales above hang ever in the balance, and when they tip—as tip they must—his soul shall find itself a beggar, with naught to pay the awful price that is at last required of all.
