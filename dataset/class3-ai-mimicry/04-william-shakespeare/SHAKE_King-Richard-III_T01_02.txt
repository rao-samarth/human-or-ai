He kept his lonely watch by the embers’ fading breath, wherefrom long shadows, like so many silent accusers, did stretch upon the chamber wall. What first was but a simple, earnest yearning to ascend, a wholesome wish to better his own state, had since become a fever in the blood; a tyrant that gives no quarter to his soul. It whispers to him in the dark, this gnawing phantom of what he might become, promising a crown if he would but forfeit all. It bids him see his friends as rungs upon a ladder, and his own honour as a coin to be spent for greater purchase. His own hands, when he doth look upon them, seem not his own but instruments of some relentless will, and the very silence of his house rings with the ghosts of cast-off pieties. He saw the end of it, a barren peak where he should stand alone, king of a kingdom made of ash and regret.
