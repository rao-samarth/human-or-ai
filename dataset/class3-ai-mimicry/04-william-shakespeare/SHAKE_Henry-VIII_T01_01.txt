Heard ye the news from the capital? The Lord General, he that did but yesterday command the fates of men with a single nod, is now himself undone. Alas, how thin is the cloth of state, and how quickly torn by the grasping hands of envy. I saw him once upon the dais, his word a thunder that made lesser men to tremble; yet those very souls who cheered his ascent, whose voices were the ladder to his height, now cast the stones that bring him to the dust. A crown, it seems, is but a heavier helmet, offering no more defence against the fickle turns of fortune than a peasant's cap. His power, which seemed a star fixed in the heavens, was but a fleeting torch, and with one gust of common breath, its brief and haughty flame is quite extinguished, leaving only the smell of smoke and the encroaching dark.
