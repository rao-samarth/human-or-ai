My dearest cousin, I write to you whilst the house lies sleeping and the moon, a lonely sentinel, keeps its watch. You speak of this world’s malice, how it doth rage like a fever in the blood and shout its own name from the highest towers, and in this, you are not deceived. For hatred is a gluttonous and noisy beast, ever feeding on itself to grow the stronger, and its triumphs are but monuments of ash and ruin. But consider this, I pray you: the smallest seed of charity, planted in a humble heart, makes no such clamour. It works its purpose in the quiet dark, a patient and persistent root that, given time, may topple the very walls that malice built. Thus, do not mistake the roaring of the fire for the truest strength, for it is the silent, growing light that shall, in the end, outlast the flame and banish all the shadows.
