Mark how that lord, with countenance so mild, doth pour the wine and offer up a toast to amity and blessed concord. His words are silken threads, spun fine to catch the ear of every listening fool, who nods and calls him friend, believing that a face so fair must house a soul of equal grace. They see the outward show, the practiced bow, the glance of humble fellowship, and think him the very pattern of a noble heart. But what a false and painted vizard 'tis! For in the chambers of his mind, ambition sharpens its cruel knife, and envy, like a jaundiced fiend, doth plot the ruin of the very man whose health he now so loudly acclaims. His fellowship is but a stratagem, his kindness but a baited hook, and his whole being a most cunning pageant played for a world too quick to praise the gilded frame and never question what the picture holds.
