My dearest brother, you ask after our cousin, and I must report what mine own eyes have here beheld at this very table. He holds his cup aloft as if it were a conqueror's sceptre, his voice a booming tempest that doth silence all gentler discourse with tales of his own cunning wit and worldly gain. Forsooth, he believes the heavens smile upon him alone, and that his grand estate was raised not by fickle chance, but by a merit so profound that lesser men must surely kneel in awe. But I see the worm of ruin coiled within his proudest boast; for when a man doth fashion himself a god and mistakes the applause of fools for true reverence, he invites fate to become his most ungentle teacher. Mark me, his fall is not a question of if, but merely of when the stage beneath his strutting feet shall suddenly give way, and all his painted glories with it.
