Mark how that gilded popinjay doth shove through the market's throng, his chin held high as if to challenge heaven. I know that gait, that scornful eye, for it was once mine own when my coffers were full and my name a word of power. I, too, did think my judgment a king that could command fate, and scoffed at counsel as the prattling of lesser men. What need had I for other men's caution, when my own star did shine so bright? But a spirit so puffed with self-regard becomes a sail too great for its vessel, fit only to catch the tempest's blast and be torn asunder. So let him strut; let him preen. He hath not yet learned that the tallest edifice casts the longest shadow, and what fortune builds upon such vanity, it will, in its own good time, delight to throw down.
