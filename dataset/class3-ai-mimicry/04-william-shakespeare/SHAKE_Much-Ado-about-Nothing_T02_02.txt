Attend me now, for this lesson is worth more than all the coin in your purse, though others may prick their ears to our business. You fret that our words to the Guild Master are but gilded lies; so they are, and what of it? Doth the sun itself not blind the eye that it may give its warmth to the skin? A blunt and artless truth, my boy, is a weapon fit only for a brute, for it wounds the wielder as oft as the foe. A well-wrought falsehood, however—a story spun with just enough silken thread of what might be—can serve a noble cause and bring a villain to his proper end where simple honesty would but break its own neck. Therefore, learn you to sheathe your candour in a velvet scabbard, and draw it forth only when the final, necessary blow is to be struck, for not all battles are won upon the open field.
