Think you this crown is but a golden comfort, a bauble to be sported with a merry heart? Nay, it is a ring of iron that doth burn the brow and press upon the mind with sleepless weight. For every judgement I pronounce, a hundred other paths are slain, and their ghosts do haunt my waking thoughts and nightly dreams alike. The people see the pageantry, the steadfast gaze I must affect; they see not the soul within, which like a frantic pilot in a storm, doth battle with the mutinous waves of doubt and fear. I must be the sun to them, a font of warmth and constant light, though my own spirit be a cold and barren country, cracked with the drought of hard choices. So chide me not for this harsh decree, for it was born of a torment you cannot know, and its cost is reckoned in parts of my own peace.
