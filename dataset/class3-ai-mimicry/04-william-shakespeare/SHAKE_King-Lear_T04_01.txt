The old merchant, gesturing with a hand knotted by age, spoke low to his apprentice, though his voice carried on the market air like the scent of dried herbs. “Heed me, boy, for this is a lesson not writ in any ledger. A man whose days are but a string of golden coins and easy smiles knows his own heart no more than he knows the dark side of the moon. For what need hath he to look within, when the world without gives him all he craves? But let calamity strike, let his ventures sink and his fair-weather fellows flee his board; then in the stark and silent chamber of his own despair, he is made to confront a most unwelcome stranger: himself. It is a terrible meeting, oft begun with curses and with tears, yet from this bitterest of soils may grow a wisdom that prosperity, in all its painted pomp, could never hope to seed.”
