Here in this clamorous street, where every man pushes for his own advantage, I have seen the black visage of retribution wear a fellow down to his very bones. He thinks to repay a slight, to make his enemy suffer as he himself hath suffered; yet in plotting such a course, he doth but forge the chains that bind his own soul and feast upon a poison of his own making. His heart, which should be a garden for gentler things, becomes a barren waste where only malice grows, watered by a constant, bitter memory of the grievance. What folly is this, to let another's ancient wrong be the cruel master of your present peace? Nay, methinks there is a greater strength, a truer victory, in letting the injury pass, like a dark cloud that for a moment but obscures the sun. To absolve the debt is to free the self from a prison of another man's making, a release far sweeter than any sharp and fleeting revenge.
