Behold yonder lord, how he doth smile and bow with such a practiced grace; a man might think him the very soul of courtesy, his every word a pearl of gentle wisdom. See how the others flock to his bright aspect, as moths unto a flame that promises but warmth and gives them ash. They see a noble countenance, a generous hand, and a heart unburdened by deceit. Yet I, who have supped with shadows and learned the speech of vipers, can spy the canker in this perfect rose. Forsooth, his virtue is a costume, his piety a well-rehearsed soliloquy for an audience he means to cozen. A man with naught to hide hath no need of such a polished shield; 'tis the hollow drum that makes the loudest sound, and his soul, I warrant, is but an echoing void, dressed in the stolen finery of a saint.
