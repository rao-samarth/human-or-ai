He was ever a man who mistook the sun's reflection in a puddle for the sun itself, and so believed he might command the heavens from his own muddy yard. We watched, mark you, as he mortgaged his good name for stones and mortar, raising a manor that scraped the clouds with such impudence, it seemed to dare the sky to strike it down. Some say 'twas noble striving, a soul reaching for a higher station than Providence had deemed his lot; but I saw the fever in his eye, the same greedy glint a jackdaw hath for a stolen jewel. He scorned our counsel, calling our caution the croaking of frightened frogs, whilst he, a great eagle, was meant for soaring. Well, the eagle hath found his wings clipped short. His monument to vanity now stands a ruin, a home for naught but spiders and regret, and he who dreamt of a throne now learns the hard humility of the beggar's bowl.
