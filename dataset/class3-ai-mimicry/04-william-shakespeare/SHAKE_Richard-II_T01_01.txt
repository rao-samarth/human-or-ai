Dost thou think that title, passed to thee like some inherited trinket, makes thy flesh to differ from mine own? Thou speak'st of God's own finger pointing to thy brow, as if the Heavens had naught else to do but consecrate thy line whilst common men must starve. Yet I see the tremor in thy hand whene'er a shutter rattles in the wind; a king anointed, who fears the night! Your majesty is but a costume for a man, and the sceptre you hold is a brittle reed against the coming storm. Think on this when you sit alone in state: the reverence of the crowd is but a vapour, a morning mist that the harsh sun of rebellion burns away. For that same power which you claim from sacred clouds is lodged within the fickle hearts of men, and what their breath has given, their roar can, with greater ease, reclaim.
