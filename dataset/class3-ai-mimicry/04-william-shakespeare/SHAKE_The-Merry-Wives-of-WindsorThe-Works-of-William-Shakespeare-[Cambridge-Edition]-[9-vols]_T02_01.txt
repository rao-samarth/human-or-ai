My dearest brother, you ask wherefore I quit the hall in such a choleric fit, and I must confess a sickness of the mind did seize me. For as I watched my sweet Eleanor speak with your friend, the young Baron, a green and venomous humour did curdle all my reason. What fiend possessed me, then, to rise before our kin, to spill forth such baseless and wretched accusations of her faith? I spake of stolen glances and whispered promises where none existed, my own soul’s dark imaginings given a foul voice to shame her before all. But, hark! The shame fell not upon her, whose innocent surprise was plain for any eye to see, nor on the Baron, who stood aghast at my mad charge. Nay, the entire company turned their pitying gaze on me, and in that sudden, heavy silence, I saw myself a wretched player in a farce of my own making, a fool pointed at and justly scorned. Hence I fled, my own honour slain by my own tongue.
