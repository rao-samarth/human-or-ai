You speak of sorrows as if they were a final judgment, a curse from which no man recovers his breath. Yet I ask thee, what is the stoutest steel that hath not been thrice plunged in the forge's fire and thrice beaten upon the anvil? Such trials do not seek thy ruin, but rather prove thy substance; they are a harsh and cruel refiner's flame, to burn away the dross and leave what is pure and strong. The soul that can endure such a tempest, and not be rent asunder, finds upon the farther shore a peace more profound, a prize more dearly won, than any joy that is given without a cost. Therefore, bear this weight, for the strength it doth demand of you shall itself become your greatest recompense when all this strife is past.
