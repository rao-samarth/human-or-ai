Goodman Hob did oft remark upon his prize goose, a creature of such fearsome and warlike bearing that children would shun the very lane where it did strut. What a noble breast it puffed, what a piercing eye it cast upon the world, and its hiss, good heavens, its hiss was a sound to curdle milk and send a stout man searching for his cudgel. But see, the truth is a sly and secret thing, for this feathered sentinel, this guardian of the green, possess'd a heart no bigger than a field mouse's and ten times more timid. Let but a shadow of a passing crow fall upon the grass, and this fearsome tyrant would squawk a most unmanly note and seek refuge 'neath a cabbage leaf, proving that a brave outside may oft conceal a soul that trembles at its own loud honk. A man may learn a lesson from a goose, I think, on how the world is cozen'd by a boastful front.
