I mark how men are swayed, not by the plain and honest substance of a cause, but by the cunning tune to which it is set. A man’s conviction is a fragile craft, and a glib orator the sudden storm that drives it upon the rocks, all whilst persuading him the shore is near. Just yestermorn, upon the cobbled square, I did observe a rabble-rouser twist the common grievance of the poor into a sharp and glittering dagger, which he then, by subtle rhetoric, placed into their very hands to aim against their neighbour. He spoke of freedom, yet forged a cage of choler; he decried tyranny, whilst making himself a king of their blind rage. Thus are men’s minds but instruments, and he that knows the fingering may play what jarring melody he will, and call it reason’s fairest song.
