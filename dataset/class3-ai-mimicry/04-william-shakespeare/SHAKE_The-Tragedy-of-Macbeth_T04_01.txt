Pray, hear me, sir, for this hollow peace I wear is but a mask for a soul most grievously afflicted. That ledger I presented, which spoke of such fine profit from the northern shipment, was a lie; a cunning fiction painted with a careful quill to hide mine own costly error. Yet what advantage is there in a master’s praise when one’s own conscience proves a ceaseless inquisitor? Since that foul moment, sleep hath forsook my chamber, and every shadow in your office seems a pointing finger, every closing door the sound of my discovery. This secret, like a canker, gnaws within, turning my bread to ash and my labour to a pageant of deceit. I sought to cheat the reckoning, and in so doing have only made my own heart a prison. Therefore, pass what judgment you will, for any penance is a mercy next to the one I do inflict upon myself each waking hour.
