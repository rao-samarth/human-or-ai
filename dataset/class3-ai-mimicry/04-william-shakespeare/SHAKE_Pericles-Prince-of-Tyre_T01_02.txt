Pray, cousin, do not let your spirits sink so low, for this city hath taught me much of that turning sphere you now lament. From this high window, I have seen a merchant, whose purse was yesterday so fat it near burst its seams, today beg for a crust outside the very shop he owned. The boisterous apprentice, whose mirth did vex the whole street with its clamour, is now a silent master of his guild, his face a mask of care; whilst his old master, a man of grave account, now capers for his drink. It is a constant, dizzying dance, wherein he who is lifted high is but poised for a fall, and he who lies lowest in the dust may yet be raised up by the selfsame, witless hand of circumstance that cast him down. So grieve not overmuch, for the wheel is ever in motion, and no man's station is fixed 'til the gravedigger calls his name.
