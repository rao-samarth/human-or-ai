My worthy Cousin, I write to you from this very hall, where feigned mirth and sour wine conspire to make a poor affair of kinship. You would not know our mutual kinsman, Thomas, were you to see him now hold court beside the hearth. A little victory, a trifling gain in office, hath so swelled his spirit that he seems a lesser man for it, not a greater. Mark how his laughter rings too loud, a hollow peal to drown the whispers of his conscience; see how his gaze doth slide past honest men to fawn upon those whose hands might lift him higher still. He who once spoke plainly of the soul now speaks of ledgers and of land. I fear this burning chase for what is ever forward leaves a man’s own virtue far behind, a forgotten country to which he can never more return. Pray heaven his ascent is not a fall from grace itself.
