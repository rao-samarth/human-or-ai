Speak you of honour in this velvet-draped hall, my lord, whilst the stench of the battlefield yet clings to my very soul? The young captain’s voice cut through the revelry, a blade sharpened by grief. He lowered his goblet, the wine within trembling like blood. "You toast to victory, to the acres of mud we have purchased with our finest sons; a wretched bargain, I say, that profits none but the worm and the crow. What glory is found in a boy's last ragged breath, or in the vacant stare of a friend whose name is now forgot? This grand affair is but a masque to hide the rot, a frantic dance upon the graves we so lately dug. We are not heroes, good sir, but beasts made mad by the drum, dressing our savagery in the fine silks of purpose, and for what? For a line drawn on a map, for a king's passing fancy. We have traded reason for ruin, and call it a noble sacrifice."
