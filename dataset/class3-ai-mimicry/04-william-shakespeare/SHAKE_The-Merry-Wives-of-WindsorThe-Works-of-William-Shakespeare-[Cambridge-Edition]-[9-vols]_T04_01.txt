Even now, amidst this feast's loud merriment, I watch him stand alone, his fortunes quite undone. He thinks his fall the work of simple fate, a truth revealed by some righteous hand; he knows not that the evidence which damned him was a fiction, a most cunning artifice we wove to catch his greater villainy. Doth a lie, then, lose its wicked sting when it serves a virtuous end? I say it doth not, yet what choice remains when foul corruption sits upon the bench and truth itself is banished from the court? When justice sleeps, some hand must needs disguise itself to wake her, and if that hand must wear a glove of falsehood to strike a rightful blow, then so be it. Let the pious prattle of their clean-souled virtue; we have done what honour, in its desperation, demanded of us, and brought a devil to his just account by a devil's own trick.
