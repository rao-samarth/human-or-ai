My dearest Sister, I must write to you from this very feast, for a shadow hath fallen upon our house that you, in your sweet innocence, cannot yet perceive. Mark our cousin, how he holds his court amongst the kinsmen, his voice a thunder where it once was but a pleasant stream. He who once shared his bread with humble grace now measures every glance, every word, for its advantage, his mind a poisoned ledger of debts and prospects. A fever for what lies just beyond his grasp hath consumed the man we knew, leaving a hollow idol in his place, draped in fine silks and soulless ambition. He speaks of destiny as if it were a beast he alone could tame, not knowing that he is already fetter'd to its will, and that the summit he so bloodily pursues is but a barren peak, cold and alone, where no good thing can grow.
