Hark, friend, and speak no more upon this course, for thy words are poisoned darts against my conscience. Was not my oath given freely, and sealed with such a solemn hand that Heaven itself did bear it witness? Now, for a whisper of preferment and the gleam of some new master's coin, you bid me tear that sacred bond asunder, as if 'twere but a flimsy parchment writ in jest. I feel the eyes of strangers here upon us in this common hall; they mark our hurried speech and see a wretch debating with his honour. What is a man, I ask thee, when his sworn allegiance, his very soul's surety, becomes a trinket to be bartered, a shifting shadow that doth flee the sun of opportunity? Perchance all promises are but breath upon a winter's pane, made to vanish when a warmer prospect shines. Cease thy counsel, for to break such faith is to unmake myself entirely, and leave a hollow thing where once a man did stand.
