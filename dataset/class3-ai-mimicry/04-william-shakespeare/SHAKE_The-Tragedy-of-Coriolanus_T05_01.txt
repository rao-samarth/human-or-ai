Come, sit you here, my son, and lend an ear to your mother’s counsel. The miller’s daughter, you say? Ay, a comely wench, forsooth, with a dowry that would mend our leaking roof and more besides. Her laughter rings as a silver bell across the village green; I have heard it myself. Yet, a bell that rings too loud may summon ill fortune as oft as joy. The gossips prattle that her wit is sharper than a mercer's needle, and her ambition wider than the fields her father owns. They say her heart is a wild bird that scorns a cage, however gilded. Pay them no mind, for they are idle tongues! Still, a wise man builds his house upon a stone, not upon the shifting sands of a willful spirit. Think on it, my boy, only think on it, for my love for you makes me see shadows where, perchance, there is only sun.
