Pray, mark this company of mine own kin, where every countenance is schooled to show a gladness it doth not possess. My uncle, whose own estate doth shrink and wither, speaks most loudly of another's folly, masking his poor fortune in a cloak of borrowed wisdom. His lady, in her turn, whose spirit I know is burdened with a secret grief, forces a mirth into her speech that sounds as hollow as a winter-beaten drum. Even the youngest ones, having learned this craft ere they could rightly speak, present a show of perfect filial duty, whilst their sidelong glances betray a sharp impatience for the weary scene to end. What a curious playhouse we make of a common supper, where the chiefest dish is a well-dressed falsehood, and each soul consumes his portion with a silent appetite, for the truth is oft a most unpalatable herb to swallow amongst fellows.
