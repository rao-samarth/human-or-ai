A heavy silence now doth fall upon these halls of commerce, where once the scratching of our quills made a most industrious music. The old master’s hand, which for so long gave surety to every bond and contract, now shakes with a palsy that mirrors the unquiet state of our own enterprise. His son, that green and untried youth, studies the ledgers with a fearful countenance, for he sees what we all do: the foreign accounts grow cold, the coin of the realm is held in doubt, and our oldest partners look for safety in other ports. What strength hath a house whose foundation cracks? Each rumour from the capital, each whispered word of new division, sends a tremor through our books of reckoning. We who chart the course of wealth now but chronicle the coming of a storm, and I fear this ink shall be the last poor vestige of a more prosperous and certain age.
