Think not too harshly on the heart that strays from its sworn course, for it is a creature of seasons, much like this very meadow. The bee that yesterday sought nectar from the clover doth today prefer the violet; is the bee then false? Or is the clover less sweet? Nay, forsooth, 'tis merely nature's whim, a turning of the world that brings new blossoms into view. So too the soul, which may for a time adore one star with ceaseless gaze, might find its eye drawn to another's rising light. This inconstancy is not a flaw to be lamented, but a promise that even after the longest winter of a love grown cold, a new and verdant spring of feeling lies in wait, ready to bloom when the sun of fortune turns its face once more upon the hopeful spirit.
