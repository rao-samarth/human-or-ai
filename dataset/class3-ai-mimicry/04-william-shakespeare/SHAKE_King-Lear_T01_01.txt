Hark how the crowd doth grant its loud acclaim, for the sentence is delivered with a grave and solemn face. They see the ermine robes, the golden chain of office, and believe the man within as unblemished as his raiment. Yet this is but a mummery for the public gaze, a well-staged play where a robed Virtue speaks her lines with practiced ease, whilst honest Truth is silenced in some forgotten room. What man here weighs the coin that passed from hand to guilty hand ere the judgment was proclaimed? None. They are content with the performance, the splendid show of law, and know not that the very scales upon which their faith depends are themselves false-weighted by a knowing thumb. This painted pageant, meant to show the state's integrity, oft serves but to conceal the greater crime: that the law itself hath been made a common strumpet, to be bought by any who can pay her price, and its pronouncements rendered as hollow as a fool’s drum.
