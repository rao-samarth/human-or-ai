My friend, you burn with such a fire as might consume a forest, or might warm a hearth for all the winter long. This thirst for place, this craving to be first, is a most potent wine that mads the brain and makes a rival of a brother. But tame this spirit; turn its mighty force from scaling brittle walls of rank and envy. Let it instead perfect your daily task, make your accounts the truest, your letters the most fair. In this, you shall not climb above your peers, but build amongst them such a firm foundation of respect that you are lifted by their common will, a nobler rise by far. Thus may your great desire not prove a poison to your soul, but rather be the very engine of a shared and prosperous estate, where every man’s success is cause for celebration.
