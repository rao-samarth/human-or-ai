Hath it come to this, that you should bid me perform a deed whose very telling would make a devil blush? My sacred oath, sworn upon my father’s grave, doth bind me to your cause, a chain I have worn with pride through sunlit victory and blackest peril alike. Yet what of that other master, the one men call honour? It is the only coin I keep which is wholly mine own, and you ask me to cast it into the mire. Tell me, my lord, how may a man serve you truly when he can no longer look upon his own reflection? To follow you in this is to become a hollow thing, a walking shadow of the man who swore you fealty. Nay, if this foul work must needs be done, then you must find a hand that is not mine; for though my life is yours to command, my name is not.
