I stood aside in the market-place, where the dust of new-cut stone did choke the air, and gave ear to two merchants in their debate. "See you this grand causeway," quoth the one, a man whose purse did seem as heavy as his jowls, "how it masters the bog and mire that once plagued this quarter? Here we have set a seal of order upon the world's untidy face, a work to outlast our very bones." But his companion, a leaner fellow with a weathered eye, did only scoff. "Aye, a seal of wax upon a boiling pot. You have paved the mire, 'tis true, but dost thou think the spring forgets its ancient course, or that the willow-root, though buried deep, hath lost its stubborn thirst? Nature is a patient creditor and will, in her own season, call for what is hers. This very stone you praise shall one day serve as cradle for the moss, and your proud order be but rubble for the worm's dominion."
