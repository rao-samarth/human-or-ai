Hold thy tongue, good lad, and still the tempest in thy breast. I see the injury that upstart apprentice hath dealt thee, and thy desire to see him paid in like coin is a fire most natural. Yet, to nurse such a grievance is to keep a serpent for a pet; it promises to strike thine enemies, but in the end, its venom works only upon its keeper. What triumph is there in dragging another down into the same mire where you yourself were thrown? Nay, the truer strength, the nobler course, lies in a grace he doth not merit. Let the slight pass; grant a pardon from a spirit far richer than his own. In this, you do not absolve his ledger of its debts, but you do free your own soul from the bitter task of being his eternal bookkeeper, a labour that would cost thee far more than his paltry insult ever could.
