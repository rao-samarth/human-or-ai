Hark, what a clamour doth arise from yonder street, where men of trade and title hurry so, their faces wrought with earnest purpose. Yet to my weary eye, they seem but shadows in a poor, flickering light; a frantic dance of ghosts whose business is but air and empty sound. I press my hand against this cool stone of the casement, and feel its solid truth, yet cannot trust the world it frames for me. Perchance my own melancholy mind hath built this hollow pageant, fashioning a city out of naught, whilst that which hath true substance doth melt away like morning mist upon the water. Or is this fleeting, fever'd dream the very sum of life? A mummer's play, where we are bid to strive and weep for what is false, forgetting what is real, until the final darkness falls upon our own poor, unremembered part.
