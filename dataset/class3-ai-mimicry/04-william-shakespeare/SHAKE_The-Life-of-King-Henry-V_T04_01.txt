A sheep, Lord Pembroke? Hath some strange fever addled thy wits, that thou shouldst wish to make our new standard the very symbol of a fool's flock? By what mad reckoning shall we hoist a banner that proclaims our chiefest virtues to be timidity and an abundance of wool? Our foes would not tremble; nay, they would fetch their carving knives and think on mutton! We are a people forged in fire, of spirit—a lion, sir, a roaring, golden lion must be our emblem, to show a heart of such courage that none dare question it. Almeric scoffed, waving a dismissive hand. "And be known as common brutes, whose only argument is a claw? Prithee, your lion starves when the hunt is poor. My sheep, good sir, provides for itself, clothes its masters, and through its gentle nature, fosters a land of quiet plenty. Tell me, which image better promises a lasting realm: a beast of ceaseless, hungry fury, or one of unassuming, bountiful strength?"
