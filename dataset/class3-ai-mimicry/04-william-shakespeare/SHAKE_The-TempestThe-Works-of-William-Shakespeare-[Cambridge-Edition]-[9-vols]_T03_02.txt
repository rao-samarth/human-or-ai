I sit within this small demesne, its stone embrace a gentle warden. Beyond, the wild heath stretches forth, a boundless sea of green and gold, inviting the soul to wander without let or hindrance. A fool might call this garden a gaol and that wild land true liberty; for what man doth not yearn to cast off his fetters and run where he will, with only the heavens for his roof? Yet I have seen the lone hare hunted on that plain, and the winter winds show no mercy to the unsheltered tree. Here, within these very walls some name a prison, the tender rose is shielded from the blast. Is the soaring hawk, then, more truly free, that must forever seek its supper and fear the coming storm, than the penned sheep that knows not the wolf’s tooth? Thus do we oft mistake the nature of our bonds, and see a cage where we have built a sanctuary.
