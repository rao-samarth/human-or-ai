My lord brother sits at the head of this clamorous board, a very picture of dominion, his every pronouncement met with such a chorus of agreement as might make an angel blush for the falsehood of it. The lords and ladies, his own issue amongst them, toast his health as if his life were a charm against all worldly ill, a mandate writ in stars. Yet I see the faint sweat upon his brow, and how his eyes flit toward his eldest son, whose patient smile doth not quite mask a wolfish hunger. Forsooth, what is this hallowed station, this God-given perch, that it should be so shaken by a rheumy cough, or undone by a son’s ambition? A breath of discontent from the kitchens, a stumble on the stair—these are the trifles that may unseat a prince. We praise the mountain for its might, yet see not the subtle crack that runs from its base unto its very peak.
