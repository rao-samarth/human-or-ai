Attend me now, you whose faces I once called my chiefest comfort, for I stand accused by my own heart. I have harboured within my breast a most insatiate fever, a desperate hunger for a station so high it rendered me blind to the goodly earth whereon we all stood. In grasping for some phantom diadem I saw glittering in the sun, I have pulled down the very pillars of our house, sacrificing its sound timber for a fool’s ladder to the clouds. Each honour I pursued, each rung I gained, was but another bond of kinship that I didst spurn and sunder underfoot. And for what prize? Behold the barren banquet before you, the silent halls where laughter hath died; this hollowed-out inheritance is the sole kingdom I have won. I sought to be the master of a mighty peak, and in my mad ascent, I have made of our prosperous valley naught but a ruin, with myself its solitary and accursed king.
