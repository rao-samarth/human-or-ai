Here upon this desolate road, with the sorry thief bound fast between us, my very spirit is made a battleground for two warring kings. The one, a stern and righteous lord, cries out for the law’s unpitying decree; for the man hath pilfered our last provisions and would have left us to the wolves, a deed that by any measure demands a harsh and swift account. Yet the other sovereign, a softer voice, doth plead for a gentler course. Look, it whispers, upon his wretched state, the hollow fear within his eyes, the map of starvation drawn upon his cheeks. Is our own virtue so great and unassailable that we may serve as both judge and executioner upon this lonely heath? To deliver him unto the magistrate is to quench his life's brief candle for certain, but to set him free is a fool’s gamble on a knave's contrition. Thus is my mind most grievously split, unable to find its peace in either choice.
