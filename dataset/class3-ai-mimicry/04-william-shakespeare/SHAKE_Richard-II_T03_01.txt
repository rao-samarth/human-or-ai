As I journey through these shires, a sorry spectacle doth greet mine eye, for I see a whole realm much like an untended plot. The wholesome herbs of justice are quite choked by the insolent nettles of greed, and the tender vines that ought to bear the sweet fruit of concord are left to wither on the bough, their promise turn'd to dust. Where is the cunning hand that once did prune these branches and give succour to the bloom? Alas, it seems the husbandman now sleeps, or worse, mistakes the briar for the rose, and with a foolish pride doth water that which only pricks and poisons. Every goodly sapling of virtue struggles for the sun, whilst all about it spreads the canker of neglect; a creeping pestilence that sours the very soil from which our common strength should grow.
