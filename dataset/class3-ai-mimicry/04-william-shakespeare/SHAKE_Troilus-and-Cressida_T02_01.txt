I do recall a time when every dew-kissed petal in this quiet field seemed a missive writ for us alone, and the firmament above, a celestial map charting our devotion’s course. We built our union not of common stone but of finer stuff—of promises whispered to the rising moon and certainties spun from sunlight. Yet the world, with its relentless seasons and its sober economy of want, hath a cruel way of demanding its toll. The coin it asks is not of passion, but of patience; not of poesy, but of plowing the same hard earth day upon weary day. What was once a soaring music between our souls is now a plainer, more pragmatic rhythm, the beat of two hearts labouring side-by-side not for a heavenly ideal, but against the simple, encroaching frost. Thus is the spirit’s high verse translated into the humble prose of survival, and a love that dreamt of eternity must learn to measure its worth in firewood and grain.
