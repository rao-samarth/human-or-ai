Observe the chief steward, how he doth comport himself with such a solemn grace, as if his very breath were a prayer for honest commerce. His speech is ever larded with pronouncements of probity, and he chides the smallest failing in a junior clerk with a thunderous gravity, making a great theatre of his own unimpeachable virtue. Yet I have seen, in the quiet of the late hour when the lamps burn low, the subtle shifting of figures in the great ledger; a swift and cunning artifice that bleeds the company's coffers whilst fattening his own. What painted saint in a chapel window presents a holier face? Forsooth, the most ravenous wolves are oft found in the whitest sheep's fleece, and the loudest sermon on fairness may be but the preface to the most villainous chicanery, a righteous noise to deafen the world to the silent scratching of a thief's own pen.
