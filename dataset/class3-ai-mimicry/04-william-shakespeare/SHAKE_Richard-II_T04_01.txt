He gripped the high-backed chair, his knuckles white as bone, and through his teeth he spake, "I have given you my solemn oath! What more would you have of me?" She laughed, a sound as sharp and cold as breaking ice. "Your oath?" she cried. "You offer me a coin made of breath and ask that I should count it as true gold. Prithee, my lord, speak no more of what you *will* do, for the garden of your intent remains a barren patch of dust where naught but weeds of promise grow. Your tongue is a fine instrument that plays a hero’s tune, yet your hands lie ever idle in your lap. A vow is but a ghost, a bodiless and wandering thing, until it be clothed in the firm flesh of action. Give me one rough, simple deed before a thousand silken-phrased assurances, for I am weary of feasting upon such empty air and find it a most bitter meal."
