I have journeyed far upon these broken roads, from high crags where shepherds chide the wind to salt-stung ports that bargain with the tide. Aforetime, a man’s accent was his brand, a mark of strife betwixt his kin and thine; the mountain-dweller scorned the fen-man’s gait, and every village kept its own small soul, jealous and proud. But look you now, what subtle music plays upon the air! I see the forester and the river-merchant, once sworn to different lords, now speak in earnest of a common fate, a single name to call this troubled land their own. It is a thing not writ in any law, nor forged in iron, but born of shared grief and a desperate hope; a ghost of concord that gives to a thousand different faces one resolute and fearful countenance.
