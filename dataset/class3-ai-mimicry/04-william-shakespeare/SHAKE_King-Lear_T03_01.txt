At my high desk, where figures march in solemn rows, I mark the boy, my own true son, who sits not ten feet hence. A stranger's air he wears, and bends his head to his own ledger as if the ink were more his kin than the blood that runs in both our veins. We have not spoke a private word since winter's last cruel frost; nay, not a word that was not of accounts or the day's dull commerce. What grievance, what small and cank'ring wound, hath grown into this great and silent chasm 'twixt our two hearts? Alas, I know not. He is a shadow of the lad I knew, and I to him, perchance, a ghost whose breath doth only stir the dust upon a forgotten page, a cold remembrance of a house now broken. We toil as one, yet are as far as warring kingdoms, and the silence is a noise that deafens all my thoughts.
