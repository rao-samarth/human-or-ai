From sundered shires and hamlets once estranged, where every brook did mark a petty bound and every hill a neighbour's jealous frown, a gentle concord now begins to bloom. The shepherd's tune, which late did sound a lonely note upon his private lea, now finds its echo in the ploughman's song across the vale; yea, their diverse melodies do weave a harmony unheard before. For in their breasts a common soil is tilled, watered by the same soft rain of fellowship and warmed by one bright sun of shared resolve. Henceforth, this land shall not be a house of many rooms with bolted doors, but rather one great hall, whose hearth doth warm all men alike, and whose stout beams are raised by every hand for the good comfort of the whole.
