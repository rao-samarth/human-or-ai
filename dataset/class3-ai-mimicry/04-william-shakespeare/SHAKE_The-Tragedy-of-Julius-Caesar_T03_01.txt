Forsooth, old Giles did glare upon the stubborn turnip, whose roots held fast within the soil as if by heavenly decree. He had chosen this very spot, this patch of earth, by his own reckoning; he had planted the seed with his own hand. Yet now, in the pulling, the universe itself seemed to hold it fast. He pulled and grunted, his face a mask of purple effort, whilst the turnip, with insolent stillness, refused his command.

But as he turned, his foot caught upon a stray pumpkin vine—a vine he himself had neglected to trim—and he tumbled most ignobly into a basket of hens' eggs. Lying in the sticky ruin, he cursed the fates for their cruel sport, never thinking that the placement of his own feet was a matter quite beneath the notice of the stars.
