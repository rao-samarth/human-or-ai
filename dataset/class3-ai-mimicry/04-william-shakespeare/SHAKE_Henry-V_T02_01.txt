Hark, how young Master Alerick doth stride into the council chamber, his promotion a bright and gilded banner borne before him, the envy of all lesser clerks. He speaks of markets vanquished and rivals overthrown, as a general might boast of cities sacked and treasure won. Yet this triumph, so loudly proclaimed, hath a quiet and a bloody cost, not reckoned in the ledgers he so cherishes; for in his swift ascent, he hath left a field of wounded spirits. Good men have been undone by whispered calumny, their careers left to wither upon the vine, their very substance consumed to feed the fire of his singular ambition. He stands upon a summit of his own devising, a king of paper and of ink, yet the silent kingdom o'er which he now presides is built upon the unseen graves of his own brethren.
