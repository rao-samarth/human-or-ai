Pray, look upon me, you who gather here in gilded finery, and see what ruin this great wanting makes. I stood once where you stand, my heart as light as any here, content with what fortune gave. But a whisper grew within my breast, a covetous fever for a station not my own, and it did poison all. What was friendship became but a tool; what was loyalty, a shield to be discarded when it grew too heavy. I saw in every smiling face a rival, and in every hand of fellowship a threat to my ascent. This gnawing worm of wanting more—and more again—hath devoured the very man I was, leaving naught but this hollowed shell to stand before you now, a monument to a kingdom won within my mind, and a soul most wretchedly and utterly lost.
