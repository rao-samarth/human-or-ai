Prithee, look upon this ruin you call a doublet! You swore its thread was spun from the sun’s own golden beams, a raiment to make kings weep with envy. And yet, what is this I see? A base and common twine, a peasant’s rope, peeking from its seam like a coward from behind a curtain. You told me its cut would lend my form the very majesty of a warlord, yet I feel more like a stuffed goose, trussed up and ready for the fire. Your silver tongue did paint a picture of such noble grandeur, a walking masterpiece of the tailor’s art. But what I have purchased, for a king’s own ransom, is but a lie stitched with cheapness; a glorious shell whose kernel is naught but hollow air and your own boundless impudence. Tell me, sirrah, doth this philosophy extend also to my purse, whose golden contents you so readily accepted for this shoddy illusion?
