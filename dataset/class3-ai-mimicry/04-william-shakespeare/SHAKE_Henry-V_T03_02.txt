Behold the bailiff in his Sunday finest, a man of meagre parts made grand by a silver chain and a borrowed solemnity. He speaks his pronouncements not in his own voice, which is thin and reedy as a marsh-bird's cry, but in a low and rumbling thunder he hath practised in his looking-glass for many a tedious hour. How slowly he doth turn his head, as if the very hinges of the world did creak with the gravity of his purpose; how he doth purse his lips to feign a weighty consideration, when all his thoughts are fixed upon his midday meal! For what is this creature, when stripped of his official seal and staff? A mere shadow, whose pronouncements are but the hollow echo of a greater lord’s command, yet he plays his part with such a ponderous art that simple folk mistake the mummer for the magistrate, and tremble at the painted frown upon his brow.
