Hath it come to this, that I should be a stranger at mine own table? My son, whose very meat was carved by my decree but yesterday, now holds the room in thrall with but a glance, a sharp command I did not give. I speak, and my voice, which once did shake the rafters with its surety, is but a winter fly’s thin drone against the glass, unheard and unregarded. The servants’ eyes, which oft did seek my pleasure, now follow his quick hand as he waves away the very wine I called for. Prithee, what am I now? A monument to what hath been, a hollowed gourd from which the seed is spent. He has usurped my place, my name, my very substance, and leaves me here to feast on memories, a ghost in the machine I built, watching my own sun set whilst his doth brightly rise.
