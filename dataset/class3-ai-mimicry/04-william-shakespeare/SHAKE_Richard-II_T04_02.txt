Prithee, speak no more, for thy tongue doth fashion promises from naught but summer's breath, which cools a fevered brow for but a moment ere it is gone. Thou wouldst have me take these airy nothings for good-struck coin, and think myself rich in thy affection; marry, I have been such a fool before, to trade my peace for such a merchant's gilded wares. Your pretty oaths are as a banquet for the ear, yet leave the heart to starve for want of a single honest morsel. Where is the body to this fine-spun ghost, the action to this brave and soaring music? Show me the substance of which these pretty shadows are but the pale reflection, or else hold thy peace, and let thy silence be the first true thing I have heard from thee this night.
