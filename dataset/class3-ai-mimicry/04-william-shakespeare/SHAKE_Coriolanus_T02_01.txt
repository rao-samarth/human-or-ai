As our carriage rattled o'er the cobbled country path, I did observe the common sort, whose faces, grimed with what they call honest toil, held a most curious and sour aspect. Their eyes, methought, followed our gilded wheels not with humble deference but with a covetous envy, as if our small comfort were a personal affront to their own miserable state. They murmur in the market square, not of poor harvest or the will of God, as is their custom, but of the weight of the lord’s new levy; a paltry sum, scarce enough to inconvenience a gentleman, yet to them it is a monstrous and devouring burden. They see not the great necessity of a strong coffer for the realm’s defense, nor the simple grace of a well-appointed court that lends us all dignity. Nay, their brutish minds can only reckon their own empty bellies, and for this dullness of spirit they wouldst blame their betters, whose chiefest crime is to be born to a station they can neither earn nor comprehend.
