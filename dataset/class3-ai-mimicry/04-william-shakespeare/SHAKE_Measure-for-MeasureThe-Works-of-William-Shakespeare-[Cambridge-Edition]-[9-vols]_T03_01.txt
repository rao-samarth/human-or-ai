Hark, how the good folk of this parish do extol the charity of the cooper, a man whose piety shines as a beacon in these shadowed lanes. With what a sober countenance he doth present his tithe, and with what a gentle hand he gives a crust to the urchin at his door, earning for himself a gilded name amongst his neighbours. Yet I have seen this selfsame man, when he believeth no eye doth watch but God's—and perchance he thinks God's eye is shut—use a false measure for his grain and speak such venom to his own blood as would make a serpent blush. So is the coin of our goodness struck: a fair face on the one side to be shown to the world, whilst the other, kept in the dark palm of the hand, bears a devil's own likeness. A man’s virtue is oft but a well-rehearsed play, and we, the witless audience, applaud the costume and forget to mark the player.
