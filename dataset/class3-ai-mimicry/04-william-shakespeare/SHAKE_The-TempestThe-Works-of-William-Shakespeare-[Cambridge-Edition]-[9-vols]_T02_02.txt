The last of the candle gutters, and in its fearful dance, throws such wanton shapes against the wainscot. A man might swear he saw a king’s court, or a legion of devils, when ‘tis naught but the wavering of a paltry flame. And what, pray, is the difference? The eye sees what the mind commands, and the mind is a most notorious liar, a jester in the skull that paints the solid world with colours of its own distemper. One moment, that looming shadow is a creeping thief; the next, a forgotten coat slung o’er a chair. Both are true, and both are false, for the substance of the thing matters not half so much as the foolish terror or vain hope we lend it. We live thus in a pageant of our own making, applauding phantoms as if they were flesh, and call this sorry spectacle the truth. What a fine and witless game we play.
