Prithee, friend, mark you how the very air grows thick with rumour? Our sovereign's health, they say, doth fail him fast, his hand too frail to hold the orb and scepter both, yet what provision is there made for the day he quits this mortal coil? I see the great lords gather in their corners, their voices low but their eyes as sharp as daggers drawn in darkness. Each doth eye the throne as if it were a prize to be won by stratagem or by the sword, and the common folk, such as we, stand betwixt these grinding stones, like wheat awaiting the miller's whim. The kingdom's peace feels but a fragile glass, which, once shattered, spills the blood of all. I tell you, I mislike these omens; when the great oak sickens at the crown, the lesser branches are the first to feel the coming storm and break.
