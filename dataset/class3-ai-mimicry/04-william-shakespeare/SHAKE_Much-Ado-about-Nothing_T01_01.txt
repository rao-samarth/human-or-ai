Hark, what a pageant doth this public square present! Each soul a player, garbed in careful smiles and courtesies as fine as silken cloaks. I hear a merchant praise his rival's wares, though yesterday he wished him ruin; I see a lady greet her friend with gilded words, yet her eyes betray a viper's envy. How strange a world is this, where every face is but a painted vizard, cunningly wrought to hide the true heart's state. What sorrows fester 'neath that cheerful mien, what treasonous plots are hatched behind a show of loyalty? We walk amongst these breathing shadows, ourselves a shadow, and take the outward seeming for the inward soul. A fool's errand, for truth lies not upon the tongue nor in the easy gesture, but dwells in some deep, unvisited chamber of the spirit, whose door is ever barred against the common view.
