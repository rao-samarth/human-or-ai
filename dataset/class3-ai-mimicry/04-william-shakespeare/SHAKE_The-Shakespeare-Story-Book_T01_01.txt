Prithee, mark that striving fellow, how he doth puff his chest and survey the common rabble as if he were some petty god descended. See how his eyes, like hungry hawks, do scan for the next perch, the next rung upon a ladder that leads to naught but emptier skies. He hath a fine coat, 'tis true, and a jangling purse, but listen closely; you may hear the hollow echo from within his soul, a cavern scoured clean by the ceaseless wind of his own wanting. He believes himself a titan bestriding the world, yet he is but a frantic ant, building a meaningless hill of dirt he cannot take with him. He barters peace for prominence and thinks it a cunning trade, the poor fool, blind to the truth that when the grave claims him, his grand titles and weighty coin shall serve only to press the earth down that much harder upon his forgotten bones.
