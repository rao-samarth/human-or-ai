You ask me wherefore this house of ours, which once stood so proud upon this humble ground, hath now but dust and sorrow for its walls. I tell you plain, the ruin came not from some tempest from without, but from a quiet poison brewed within our own chambers. A brother’s trust, once a stout and unbreached beam, was made a splinter by a whispered lie; a mother’s love, the very hearthstone of our days, grew cold and cracked with envy’s bitter draft. What part played I, the father and the master of this sad estate? I stood a witless watchman, deaf to the gnawing worm, blind to the spreading stain, until the very roof gave way. Now we are but strangers sharing a name, ghosts that haunt the memory of a feast, and this hollow shell is the sole monument to our affections, which we ourselves did slay.
