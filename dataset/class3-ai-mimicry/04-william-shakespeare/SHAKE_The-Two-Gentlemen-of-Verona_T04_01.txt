Prithee, friend, keep thy voice to a murmur, for the very walls of this tavern seem to listen. Dost thou not find it a curious sport? To be so clad in humble rags, this beard of false flax upon my chin, and move amongst the common sort as one of their own flock. Why, just anon, the very constable who would tremble to meet my gaze did jostle me aside to purchase his ale, giving me naught but a gruff word. A strange and heady freedom it is, to be a ghost in mine own city; to hear the unvarnished truths and sour complaints meant for ears other than a magistrate's. Perchance this is the greater power: not to be known and feared by all, but to be truly seen by none, a simple shadow amidst the crowd, gathering secrets as a beggar gathers coins.
