The old steward, having grown weary of his charge, did most foolishly bequeath his keys to the hens themselves, proclaiming a new age of liberty in the coop. And what a kingdom they have made! A parliament of squawking, where every feather’d fool pecks at his neighbour for a better perch, and the strongest rooster, a beast of more pride than sense, now struts upon the water trough as if it were a throne. Their fine order is quite undone; the eggs lie cracked and spoiled, and the fox, who was once a distant fear, now sits smiling at the gate, licking his chops in sweet anticipation. A brave governance, forsooth, where freedom is but another name for a well-plucked and roasted future, and every voice, raised in liberty, sings a note in the dirge of its own undoing.
