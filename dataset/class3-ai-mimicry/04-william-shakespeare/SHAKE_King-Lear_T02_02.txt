Yet when the talk did turn to a question of justice, and all the learned men were tangled in their laws and precedents, my uncle laughed, a strange and hollow sound. "You seek justice in a book?" he cried, his eyes alight with a fearsome clarity. "Nay, you are fools; for justice is no dead letter writ on parchment, but the very breath a drowning man doth gasp for when the world's great weight is on his chest. You must first feel the water in your own lungs ere you know its truth." A silence fell upon the room, for in his fractured sense, a greater sense was found than all their sober reason could afford.
