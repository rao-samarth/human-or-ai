You speak of sovereignty as if 'twere a garment to be worn for state and then cast off for private ease. I tell you, sir, this mantle is a second skin, grafted to the very soul, which I may not shed until the grave itself provides a final disrobing. Every waking hour is a performance upon a stage most cruel, where each common eye is a critic, and every whisper a judgement on the play. I must school my face to show a placid strength when my own heart is a tempest; I must speak in measured tones of hope when despair is my closest counsellor. This is not governance, but a slow and artful dying of the self, for the man I was is long since buried beneath the robes you so admire. Thus, what you call my reign is but my penance, and the applause of the crowd the loneliest sound I know.
