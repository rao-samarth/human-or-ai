Friend, pour me another, for my mind doth turn on strange contrivances. Had I not been so roundly cheated by that knave at the crossroads, losing thereby my purse and my good temper, I should have journeyed on to that wretched port ere the storm made its fury known. My ship, they say, and all its souls were swallowed by the waves. Dost thou not see it? A villain's petty crime hath saved my life, a loss so bitter hath yielded such a sweet and present gain. Men may call it fortune's whim, a random toss of the die, but I feel a governance in this, a secret pilot who, when I would steer my bark upon the rocks, doth turn the rudder with a hand unseen, to guide me safely into some quiet harbour I knew not I was seeking.
