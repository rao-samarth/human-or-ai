Amidst the revelry of the duke’s great hall, the elder lord approached the newly-honoured captain, who stood watching the dancers with a distant eye. “You seem a man apart from your own triumph, sir,” the lord observed, his voice a low murmur beneath the music. “Doth this new-won estate weigh so heavy upon your soul?” The captain turned, his gaze clearing as if from a far-off storm. “Nay, good my lord, not heavy, but dearly bought. Methinks I still feel the biting frost of that northern waste, the gnawing hunger that was my only bedfellow. Each cheer in this warm hall is but an echo of some past groan.” The old lord placed a hand upon his shoulder. “Then let them be so. For the root that wrestles with the stoniest ground brings forth the sweetest fruit at last. Heaven does not grant its fairest prizes to those who have not felt the lash of fortune’s spite, for only such a man may know the true and precious worth of what he holds.”
