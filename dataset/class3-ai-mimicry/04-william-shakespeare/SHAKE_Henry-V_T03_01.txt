Hark, how the constable doth puff his chest upon the market stones, making a grand theatre of a common scuffle! He seizes a lad by the scruff, a boy whose crime was but a shouted jest, and proclaims his doom for all to witness. "Thou shalt learn respect for the King's own law!" he cries, his voice a great bell rung too loud, whilst his eyes dart not to the trembling youth but to the gathered crowd, seeking their fearful approval. He is an actor playing a king for a single, fleeting scene; his stage is the street, his pronouncements are his lines, and his authority is but a costume he must pray we do not see through. For should one man laugh, or turn his back upon the show, the entire pageant crumbles into dust, leaving but a common man in a borrowed coat, shouting at a boy who has already slipped from his grasp and vanished into the throng.
