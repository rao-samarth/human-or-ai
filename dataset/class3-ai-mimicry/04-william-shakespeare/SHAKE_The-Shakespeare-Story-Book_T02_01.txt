As this weary road doth carry me from that sad town, my soul is much disquieted by what I there did witness. For in that place, two houses of a noble stock have, by their long and canker’d enmity, made a desert of their own inheritance, feeding their malice until it hath consumed all goodness. What pride, what devilish and unnatural spleen, could so possess a man that he would see his own blood spilt upon the stones rather than yield an inch of ground? Methinks the very air is sick with the ghost of their choler, and the dust itself is made of nought but the crumbled monuments to their endless strife. Their children now learn to curse ere they can pray, and the patrimony they shall one day claim is but a heap of ash and sorrow, a foul inheritance bought with the coin of their fathers’ venom.
