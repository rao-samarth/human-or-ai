By the guttering candle's light, he saw not his own countenance in the darkened glass, but a ghost of counsel past. For what man is truly his own creation when from his first breath another’s voice hath been the music to his soul? Her words, planted in the fallow soil of his youth, do now spring forth as his own convictions, and the moral compass by which he steers his troubled course was forged not in his own heart, but in the crucible of her will. He may journey to the farthest shores and wear the raiments of a king, yet that gentle whisper from his infancy shall ever be the sovereign of his mind, the silent author of his every noble deed or secret shame. Verily, a man’s truest nature is but an echo, and the first sound it learns to mimic shapes its call for all his days.
