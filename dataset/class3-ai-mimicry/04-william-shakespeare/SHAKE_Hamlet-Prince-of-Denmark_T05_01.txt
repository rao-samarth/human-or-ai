My dearest cousin, I write to you from amidst the clamour of our kinsmen, where laughter rings as freely as the poured ale. Yet as I watch our uncle, his hair the very snow of winter, sit beside your youngest son, whose cheeks are yet the blush of spring, a solemn thought doth seize my heart. Forsooth, though we make merry and toast to futures yet unwritten, a silent guest sups with us at this very table, a shadow that no candle may dispel. This final creditor makes no distinction 'twixt the hale and the infirm; he calls upon the prince in his high castle and the shepherd in his humble cot with equal surety. We dance and sing, but our music plays only for a time, for every soul’s last partner is that same grim figure, whose patient hand shall one day lead us all from the warmth of the hall into the silent, unyielding dark.
