Pray, attend to my account, for I was once the master of this domain. My signature was the final stamp upon every contract, and my judgment the firmament on which this enterprise was built. Now I am made a cipher, a hollow echo in these corridors where once my footstep commanded silence. They have stripped me of my duties, handing the great seal of my office to a youth whose chin hath not yet known a razor's touch. What great fault, what grievous error hath brought me to this pass? To be a living monument to mine own ruin, to watch the work of a lifetime dismissed as a trifle—this is a punishment most cruel. I am unseen, unheard, a shadow left to haunt the place where I was once the substance; a king of paper and ink, now deposed and left with naught but the memory of a crown.
