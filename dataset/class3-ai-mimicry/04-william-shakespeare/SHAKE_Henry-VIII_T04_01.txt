In our humble village, where the greatest strife was once the price of barley, there lived a man whose soul did swell with a most unwholesome yearning. He looked upon his neighbors' simple content and saw not peace, but a prison of mediocrity. Why, he would oft proclaim to the unlistening wind, must a man be bound by the station of his birth? Thus he began to build his tower, not of stone, but of borrowed coin and brittle promises; he scorned the hands that had once helped him, seeking instead the fleeting praise of distant lords. But the higher he climbed upon this precarious ladder, the more the very ground beneath him did seem to resent his ascent. For the man who seeks to touch the sun with wings of wax doth find his fall is not merely to the earth, but into a pit of his own making, where the shadows of what he forsook mock him more cruelly than any foe.
