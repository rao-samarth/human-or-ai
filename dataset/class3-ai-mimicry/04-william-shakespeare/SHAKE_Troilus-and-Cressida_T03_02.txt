You toast this triumph, cousin, with such unbloodied hands, and speak of a cause the heavens themselves have blessed. But I have looked upon the visage of this blessed cause, and it is a grim and leprous thing that takes good men, honest farmers and stout-hearted smiths, and teaches them the base art of butchery. Nay, it is a craft far fouler, for a butcher slays a beast for meat, whilst we were bid to slay our brothers for a coloured rag upon a pole. We marched forth with pious prayers upon our lips and returned, those of us who did, with naught but curses in our hearts, our souls so hollowed out that even this fine feast tastes only of ash and the dust of forgotten men. So raise your cup, boy, but know that what you celebrate is but a fever of the mind, a grand and painted madness that makes monsters of us all and names the ruin glory.
