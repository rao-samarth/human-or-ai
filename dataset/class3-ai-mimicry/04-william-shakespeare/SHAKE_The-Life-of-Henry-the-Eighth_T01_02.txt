The gilded hall doth ring with practiced praise, and every fawning courtier bends the knee before this lonely elevation. I mark their painted smiles and hear the hollow music of their vows; they swear a fealty that lasts only so long as fortune’s sun doth shine upon my house. For what is this high seat but a perch upon a shifting dune? A single gust of winter’s rumour, a whisper of dissent grown to a clamorous wind, and this entire glittering assembly would scatter like startled doves, leaving the silence to claim me. They bow not to the man, but to the crown he wears, and that same golden circle is a heavy, brittle thing. Another’s head shall bear it soon enough, and these same mouths will learn his name as sweetly.
