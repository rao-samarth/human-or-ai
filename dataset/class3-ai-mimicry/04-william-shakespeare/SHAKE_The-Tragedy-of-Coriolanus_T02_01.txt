As I do travel upon this weary road, mine eye doth mark the strange and cruel division of this world: how one man’s house doth scrape the very clouds whilst his poor brother’s hovel scarce keeps out the wind. For in the empty stomach of the commons, a bitter poison brews, and envy’s sharp-tooth’d serpent makes its nest where piety should dwell. The lord in his hall, his belly full of capon and of wine, recks not of the wretch who sups on naught but air and discontent; nay, he calls it Fortune's will. But what fortune is this that sets one man so high upon the backs of many, until the foundation itself doth crack and tremble? The great ones, from their gilded perch, cast down a look of scorn, whilst from the mud below, a thousand eyes look up, their gaze a mix of supplication and of mutiny. This is a peace most false, a quiet that but masks a coming tempest.
