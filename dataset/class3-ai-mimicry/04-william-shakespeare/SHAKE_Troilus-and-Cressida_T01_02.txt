Upon a gentle rise, where the wind doth whisper secrets to the bending grass, I marked a common field-flower, a thing of simple grace and no renown. The great lords in their halls boast of their exotic blooms, fetched from sun-scorch'd lands at heavy cost, and praise them with such gilded speech as would make a plain thing blush. Yet this small, unheeded blossom asks for no man's favour; it lives by its own light and by the grace of heaven alone. Its honest face, turned ever toward the sun, holds a truth more profound, methinks, than all the perfumed vanities that are bought and sold for coin. For what is a king's jewel but a polished stone, if no eye calls it precious? And what is this small flower but a perfect wonder, though it live and die with none to mark its passing, save the bee that sups upon its heart and the sky that looks upon its form.
