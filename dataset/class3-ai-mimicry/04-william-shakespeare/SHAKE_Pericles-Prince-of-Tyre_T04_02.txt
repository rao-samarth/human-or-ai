Dost thou stand there, a living mockery of my grief? Answer me, for mine own eyes, long since drowned in sorrow, do conspire to play me false. By what devil's artifice or heavenly grace dost thou walk this dusty track, when report and reason both did swear thou hadst given up thy ghost to the cold earth of a foreign field? I saw the very letter that spoke of thy final breath, and I have made my peace with thy grim shadow, a constant and a bitter companion. Hath the grave grown so full it can no longer hold its company, or art thou some phantom sent to vex my soul upon this weary journey? Prithee, speak, ere this sudden shock of sight, this most impossible vision, doth cleave my very heart in twain betwixt a fearful joy and a despair renewed.
