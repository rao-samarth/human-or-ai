Hark, what a clamour fills these city stones, a ceaseless tide of men both great and small. A moment since, the Prince’s guard did pass, their steel a-glint, a terror to the eye; and now, the Bishop’s train, in solemn pace, doth cleave the crowd with whispers of the cross. Which master, then, doth claim the truer reign? The one commands the body with his sword, and fills his coffers with a worldly tax, whilst th’other claims dominion o’er the soul, and promises a treasure past the grave. They are as two ambitious suns that strive to rule a single sky, and we poor men, caught in their warring light, know not which orb to praise for warmth, and which to fear for burning us to dust. Wherefore must a man divide his heart, and give one piece to Caesar, and the rest to God, when both do claim the whole of him as theirs?
