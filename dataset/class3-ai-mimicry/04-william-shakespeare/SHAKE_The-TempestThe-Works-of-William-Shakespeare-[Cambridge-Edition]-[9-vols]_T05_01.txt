Make haste, the flame must hold its constant heat, lest all this patient toil be brought to naught! But what new devilry is this that scrapes behind the stone? A grasping vine, a thing of witless green, hath with a brutish strength forced mortar from the wall and thrusts its head into my very chamber of precise works! See how its searching tendrils, like a foolish thief, now grope amongst my tools and careful measures. Alas, it strikes the glass! My purest art, that crystal born of fire and human mind, is spilled upon the flagstones, there to mingle with the common dirt. A curse upon this wild and thoughtless growth that knows not what it doth undo, but strangles order in its mindless quest for sun.
