I write to thee from this strange and sun-scorched port, a place where my very countenance doth seem an offense to the native eye. Forsooth, they look upon my foreign visage not with curiosity, but with a cold and settled scorn, as if my darker hue were a mark of some inner villainy. I walk amongst them as a shade, my person noted but my spirit utterly unseen; their whispers are like the stinging of unseen gnats, a constant vexation upon my soul. What fellowship can be found where a man's worth is measured by the tint of his skin and not the quality of his heart? Alas, this land, for all its beauty, hath proven a most desolate prison, for no walls are so strong as the prejudice that bars a soul from the good company of others.
