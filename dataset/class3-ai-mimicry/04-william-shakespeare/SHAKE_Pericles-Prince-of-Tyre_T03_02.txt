Behold how my kinsmen make merry, their bellies full of my lord uncle’s bounty, and their mouths full of his praise. They call him generous, and so he is; he gives freely what was never his to keep. Yet amidst this company of gilded wolves, my younger brother sits, a strange and quiet creature, his conscience a clean and polished glass reflecting all our sullied visages. They toast his simple goodness, his unblemished soul, for such a thing is useful, a pretty mantle to hide the household’s rot. I, too, raise my cup to this pure fool, for what is one good man in a den of sinners but an alibi for the rest? His virtue is the single white thread they point to in a cloth of utter blackness, and by its light, we see our own cunning ways more clearly still, and find them good.
