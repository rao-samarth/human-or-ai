Before what court do I now stand, with naught but shadow for my judge and the flickering candle for a witness? This hand, this very flesh and bone, didst commit the act that blackens all my days hence. Yet I do ask thee, whosoever scribbles our histories in the heavens, was the motion mine own? Or did some unseen hand but guide my arm, as a player moves a wooden king upon a board, making of my will a painted counterfeit? For if I be but a mere instrument, a tool of some grand design, why then doth this most grievous torment plague my heart? A puppet feels no sting of conscience, nor doth the storm repent the ships it sinks. Alas, I am undone by the question itself; condemned to know the sin, yet never know its true and final author, be he God or my own wretched self.
