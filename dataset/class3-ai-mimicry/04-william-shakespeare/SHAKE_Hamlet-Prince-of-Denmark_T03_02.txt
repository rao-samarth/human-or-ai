So, you pronounce me mad, my lord? And by what high measure dost thou weigh the contents of a mind, to find it wanting? Is it by the decree of the common herd, that bleating flock which calls the wolf a shepherd if he but wears the proper coat? Their wits are sound, forsooth, only because their great follies are of a shared and comfortable pattern; a fashionable lunacy they all agree to name as sense. Perchance the truest Bedlam is not a place of chains and straw-strewn floors, but this very world, where men conspire to call an echo a voice. I see the canker in the rose whilst you praise its fleeting bloom. Tell me, then, which is the greater affliction: to see the rot that is truly there, or to call the dying flower perfect and breathe its pestilent perfume?
