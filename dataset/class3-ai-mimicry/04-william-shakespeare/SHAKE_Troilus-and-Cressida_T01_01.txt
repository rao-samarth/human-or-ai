By candlelight’s faint and dancing gleam, the old man turned the wooden cup within his hands, his knuckles pale against the dark-grained ash. “You prize this bauble more than all your silver, sir?” his ward did ask, her voice a silken thread in the deep quiet. “’Tis but a simple, unadorned thing, scarred by time’s rough hand.” He smiled, a slow and weary gesture. “Aye, child, for the world sees but the wood, and calls it poor. They measure what a thing will fetch in coin, what praise it wins from envious eyes, and name that its quality. But I do know the hand that shaped it, and the truth it holds within its very grain; that is a worth no market ever knew, a richness that the breath of common judgment cannot tarnish. Let them have their glittering dross; this cup, to me, is truer gold than gold itself, for what it *is*, not what it seems.”
