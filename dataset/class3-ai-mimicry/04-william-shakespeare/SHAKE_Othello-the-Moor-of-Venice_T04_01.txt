My Dearest Cousin, I write to you from these quiet fields, where the loudest sound is but the breeze that troubles the barley. Yet even here, my mind finds no true peace, for I have been lately taught a most bitter lesson on that which men call their good name. This cherished prize, which a man may spend a lifetime in honest labour to fashion, is a thing of such brittle and glassy substance that a single stone of calumny, idly cast by some malicious hand, may shatter it beyond all hope of repair. A whispered lie, cousin, hath more wicked potency than a thousand righteous deeds, for it travels on the wind and lodges in the ear of any fool who will give it shelter. Once this poison takes root, it doth blacken the very soul of a man's report, leaving a stain that no passage of time nor earnest protestation of innocence can ever hope to scour away. Beware the praise of the crowd, for their cheers turn to curses with the turning of the tide.
