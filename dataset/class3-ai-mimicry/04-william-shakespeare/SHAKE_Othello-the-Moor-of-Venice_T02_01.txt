The morning sun doth gild our quiet streets, lending to each humble cottage the false face of sweet content. From my sill, I mark the baker's wife, who sweeps her step with such a show of simple duty; yet I recall the bitter tempest in her voice that raged ere the cock crew. The cooper, whistling a bright tune as his barrels roll, hath a soul so weighted down with debt it scarce can stand, his mirth a painted shield against the town's sharp pity. For in this place, we are but players in a silent, sorry show, where smiles are worn like Sunday vestments and every 'good morrow' doth conceal a private wound. They perform their daily rounds, a pageant of fair seeming, whilst I but see the unseen griefs that cling to their very shadows and give the lie to the bright day.
