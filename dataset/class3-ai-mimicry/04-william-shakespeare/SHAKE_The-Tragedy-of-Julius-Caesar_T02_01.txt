Hark, my dear son, and look you upon this gathering, a kingdom built not with the sword but with good cheer. Many a man I have seen in my time, with eyes that burned for a higher seat, who thought to climb upon the backs of their fellows to grasp a barren sceptre. Yet what becomes of their hollow conquests? Their names fade like breath on a winter's morn. But see here the legacy that endures: the laughter of children, the loyalty of kin, the quiet peace of a house filled with love. Let this be the summit of your striving. For true wealth is not counted in coin nor measured in leagues of land, but is found in the steadfast hearts that surround you. A man whose greatest ambition is the happiness of his own hearth shall never know the poverty of a lonely throne.
