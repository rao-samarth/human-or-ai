Upon this winding road, I once did curse the lowering clouds and mourn the sun's retreat, for all seemed set for ruin and for rain. The very birds were hushed; the world presented but a cheerless face. Yet what false counsel doth the eye oft give the soul! For look you now, the heavens part, and golden light doth pierce the grey to make each common leaf a jewel. This journey, which began in such a sober guise, now promises a fairer end than its first seeming did portend. Thus we learn that a foul beginning may yet father a most glorious day, and the truest worth of any path is found not at its start, but in the grace of its unfolding. Let us then go forward with good heart, for the world’s true countenance is oft a thing concealed, revealed but to the patient and the hopeful spirit.
