Wherefore dost thou press this matter with such haste, as if my heart were but a fallow field to be plough'd and planted by another’s will? The world’s loud voice, I know, doth call it wisdom to see our fortunes join’d and lineages secured ere youth hath fled; it deems a soul that walks alone a vessel lost, a barren branch upon a fruitful tree. Yet what of that true concord, which is not bargain’d for in drawing-rooms nor proclaim'd by the town-crier for all to praise? Must we perform this pageant for the good opinion of the crowd, and bind ourselves with vows that serve their comfort more than our own souls? Nay, I fear such a union, born of duty and the common breath, is but a gilded prison, which may shine to outward eyes but keeps the spirit lock'd in silent discontent, a cold and hollow echo of what love should be.
