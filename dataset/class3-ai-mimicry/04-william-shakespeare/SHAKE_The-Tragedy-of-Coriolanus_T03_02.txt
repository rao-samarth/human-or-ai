Here by this slow and witless stream, I take what poor ease I can, though my soul finds none. In the great halls of state, they speak much of the common good, a noble cloak to hide a thousand petty bargains. For a sliver of land, for a whispered promise of a future title, I did consent to a measure I knew to be false in its very heartwood. They called it a wise bending to the wind; yet in the silent chamber of my own mind, I called it a breaking. What profit hath a man if his good name be writ in gold upon a roster of knaves? That simple verity I once held dear, I have let fall into the mud of expedience, and now this quiet country air doth seem to mock me with its own clean honesty, a rebuke more sharp than any courtier’s tongue.
