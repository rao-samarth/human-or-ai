Behold this room of kin, where every smile is a calculation and each toast a pledge not to the heart, but to the house. I must play my part in this grand pageant, nodding to the talk of dowries and dominions, whilst my own spirit, a restless ghost, doth pace the confines of my ribs. What is a man but two contrary selves locked in a single breast? One is the public figure, the name that is spoken with reverence or with fear, whose every action serves the greater weal. The other is a creature of shadow and silence, who yearns for simple suns and treasures things of no account to the wide world. To serve the bloodline or to serve the soul—this is a war fought in a kingdom of one, and I fear the self that wears the crown is but a puppet, whilst the true king remains a willing prisoner in the dungeon of his own heart.
