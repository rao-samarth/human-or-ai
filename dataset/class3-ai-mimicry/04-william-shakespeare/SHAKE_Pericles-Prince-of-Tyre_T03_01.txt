In this great house of commerce, where falsehood is the common coin and every fellow’s tongue is oiled with praise for his master’s ear, there sits one youth whose soul hath not yet learn’d this knavish art. His ledger shews a plain and honest face, with no foul blot to mask a stolen groat, and where others bow with feigned humility, he gives but what respect is truly owed, and no jot more. His fellows, seeing this, do smile in scorn, and call his truth a simple, witless thing, fit for the cloister but not for worldly gain. Yet I do watch him, and I wonder much: how long shall such a single, steady candle burn in this foul and greedy wind, ere it be snuff’d out by envious breath, or else must learn to feed on the same rank tallow that doth fuel all the rest?
