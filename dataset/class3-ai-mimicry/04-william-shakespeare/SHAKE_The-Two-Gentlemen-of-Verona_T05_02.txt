My dearest brother, I must unburden myself of a vexation that now plagues our counting-house. Young Master Philip, whose mind for sums I once did praise as the swiftest in the parish, hath been struck down by a most grievous malady; not of the body, but of the fancy. His sharp wit is now blunted, his gaze fixed upon some distant memory of a smile, and he sighs with such a melancholy air that he quite curdles the morning’s ink. A merchant's daughter, they say, is the cause of this distemper, a creature he hath seen but once. For this brief vision, he now miscounts the ledgers and dreams where he ought to reckon, proving that no man is so sensible that his reason cannot be made a fool and a bankrupt by a pair of bright eyes. Pray send me your counsel, for his affliction tries my patience sorely, and good apprentices are not so easily found.
