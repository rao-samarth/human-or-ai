Here in the quiet of this meadow, where only the wind stands as witness to thy shame, I call thee to account. That thou, whose fealty I held more constant than the northern star itself, didst conspire with lesser lights to cast a shadow upon my name—'tis a wound most deep, a poison craftily administered in a cup of seeming friendship. The very air, which once did carry naught but our shared vows, now bears the sour echo of thy deceit. What defense canst thou offer for such a turning? None, I think, that would not further shame thy tongue. Yet look upon my face; see there no lasting tempest. My wrath, it seems, is but a fleeting vapour, for I find I cannot nurse a malice where love hath so long made its habitation. Go, thy trespass is forgot ere the sun hath set upon it; let us speak no more of this winter's chill, but look instead toward a greener spring.
