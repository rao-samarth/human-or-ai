What strange and welcome sun now breaks upon this house, where winter's frost so long held court. The very air, which once was thick with whispers sharp as knives, now carries laughter on its breath, a balm to wounds unseen. Behold the elder son, whose trust was split asunder by a brother's envious lie, now pours a cup for that same man; and in their eyes, a pardon is writ plain for all to see. For though the memory of that poison'd word and faithless deed remains a ghost that haunts the feast, it hath no power to chill this newfound warmth. Yea, this fragile concord, a tender sapling planted in the ruin of old sorrows, may yet grow to a mighty tree, and give good shelter to a family mended and made whole once more.
