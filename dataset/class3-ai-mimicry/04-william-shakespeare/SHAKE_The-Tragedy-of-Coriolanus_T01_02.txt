What bitter draught is this, to be so utterly undone? I, who held the master’s ledgers as mine own dominion, am now cast out, a stranger to the halls where my voice once commanded silence. I did mistake his trust for a crown, and wore it with a tyrant’s vanity, believing my judgment the firmament itself, immovable and true. The whispers of my fellows, those cautions offered in a humble spirit, I dismissed as the envious hiss of lesser men who could not grasp the genius of my reckonings. I saw their diligence as a slow and plodding beast, whilst I, a soaring eagle, need not heed the ground below. But the eagle that flies too near the sun finds its wings are only wax and feather, and oh, the fall is swift and merciless. This solitary chamber is the kingdom I have built; its walls are my vanity, its ceiling my folly.
