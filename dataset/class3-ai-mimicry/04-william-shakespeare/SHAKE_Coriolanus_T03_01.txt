How like a shifting sand these fellows are, within this very counting house. But yesterday, Master Hemlock’s decree for new ledgers was met with such a chorus of praise as to deafen a king; they lauded his great wisdom, his care for our clerkly duties. Today, what foul wind hath blown? A single sour rumour, a mere trifle of gossip from the docks, and that same wisdom is now called tyranny. Their lauded saviour is become a villain, and their once-eager quills now scratch with sullen spite. Their affections are but a cheap bauble, given freely to the first smiling face and snatched away at the first frown. They possess no anchor for their thoughts, being tossed upon the boisterous sea of common chatter, and would as soon crown a fool as hang a saint, if the mob but roared its assent.
