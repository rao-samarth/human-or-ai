That thy tongue, which I have held more dear than any music, could fashion such a wounding falsehood; 'tis a marvel of foul nature. A moment past, thy treachery did seem a serpent coiled about my heart, its venom working through my every vein, promising a winter of unending grief. I look'd upon thee and saw a stranger, a villain mask'd in the sweet guise of friendship. But now, seeing thy wretched form, thy downcast eye that dares not meet with mine, my rage doth cool and curdle into pity. What gain is there in vengeance, save to make two souls miserable where there was but one? Nay, let it pass. Though the wound be fresh, my pardon shall be its immediate balm, for to hold this grudge were but to poison my own spirit for a crime already done.
