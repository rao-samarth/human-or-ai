His Worship, a portly fellow whose legal pronouncements were oft inspired by the rumblings of his own gut, gave solemn ear to the lamentable tale of a stolen mutton pie. The complainant, a baker's wife with a tongue as sharp as her kneading-knife, pointed a floury finger at a bewildered tinker, a man whose only sin was to have admired the pastry's steam from the lane. "Prithee, good sir," the tinker stammered, "I did but smell it!" A fatal error, for the magistrate, stroking a chin that had not been seen by its owner in a decade, declared the matter settled. The smelling, he proclaimed with a great show of wisdom, constituted the theft of the pie's very soul and essence; the eating of it were but a secondary, corporeal crime. And so the poor tinker was fined two shillings for this olfactory larceny, while the true thief, a fox, was like as not digesting the evidence behind a hedgerow, wholly ignorant of such fine-spun law.
