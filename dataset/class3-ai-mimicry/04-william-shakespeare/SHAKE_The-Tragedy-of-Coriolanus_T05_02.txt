With every league this jolting carriage claims, her voice doth yet pursue me, a constant and unwelcome fellow-traveler upon this weary flight. She poured her counsel in mine ear, not as a command, but as a tender dew which a man scarce feels until he is soaked through with its design. What I once held as purpose sprung from mine own breast, I now perceive as but her whispered stratagem; a path she laid with softest words that I, in my blind pride, might think the finding of it my discovery. She hath fashioned my desires to serve her own ends, and so cunningly that I, poor fool, did thank her for the gilded cage and call it freedom.
