Hark, how the wind doth moan about the eaves, a sound much like the groans of men I have undone. They call this chamber a sanctum, yet I find no peace within its gilded cage; the very shadows, methinks, do conspire and whisper my name with a serpent's hiss. This morning, a hundred courtiers did bow and scrape, their smiles as false as a painted heaven, yet I saw in every eye the glint of the dagger they keep for my back. They think me a fool, blinded by the lustre of this circlet. But greatness is no mantle of command; 'tis a shroud woven of men's jealousies and the fickle breath of the mob. The same hands that today strew petals in your path will tomorrow hurl stones, should the fancy take them. So let them watch. I watch them closer still, for the ascent to this high seat is a perilous climb, and the descent therefrom a sudden, fatal fall.
