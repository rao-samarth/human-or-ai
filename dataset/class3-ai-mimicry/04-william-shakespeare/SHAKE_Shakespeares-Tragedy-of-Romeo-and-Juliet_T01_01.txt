What bitter humour doth possess this place, that neighbour looks on neighbour with a jaundiced eye? A foul distemper, born of some forgotten slight, hath made a monster of a petty grudge, and its shadow lengthens with each setting sun, turning cobblestones to beds of thorns. Yet even here, where envy's weed grows rank and chokes the common good, a different power takes its root. I saw but yesterday a widow share her meagre meal with the very man whose kin had wronged her own; a simple kindness, offered with no thought of gain, that did more to quiet the braying hounds of discord than any magistrate's decree. For malice is a hollow, clamorous thing, a tempest in a cup that spends its fury and is gone; but charity, that quietest of virtues, builds its kingdom on a firmer ground, and its silent work shall endure when all this sound and fury is forgot.
