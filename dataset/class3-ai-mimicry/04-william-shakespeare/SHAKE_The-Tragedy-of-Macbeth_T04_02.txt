The witching hour is come, and all the house lies still, yet sleep doth spurn my company. For what rest is there when the mind itself becomes a court, and memory the pitiless accuser? I see the deed again, not as a fading dream, but as a stain fresh-spilt upon the whitest cloth, which no amount of scrubbing may make clean. This spectre of my own making hath no chains to rattle, nor any ghastly visage, yet it is a presence more profound than any spirit from the grave; it sits upon my heart, a heavy stone, and whispers of a reckoning that no earthly justice can provide. A man may flee his enemies, he may buy his peace with gold, but from this inward judge, this shadow of his own foul act, whence comes escape? Alas, it is a poison one doth drink himself, and must thereafter bear the sickness to the end.
