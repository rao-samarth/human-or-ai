Hark, what a clamour from the public square, where every ambitious fool with a polished phrase doth vie to win the favour of the mob! They promise mountains of gold and rivers of wine, whilst their own purses grow fat on the city's leanness. Observe the man of simple truth, whose plain-spoken word is his only coin; he is shouted down, called a churl, and trampled in the rush for some smiling knave who hath mastered the art of seeming what he is not. Forsooth, in this great theatre of governance, honesty is a most cumbersome costume, and he who wears it shall play no leading part. The people cry for a saviour, yet they will ever choose the serpent with the sweetest hiss, and count his venom for a wholesome draught. 'Tis a comedy, methinks, where the prize is but a gilded chair and the cost is one's very soul.
