Observe how these scattered shires, each with its own temper and tongue, do by slow degrees learn a common soul. The shepherd on the bleak northern moor, whose world is but the sky and his flock, and the bargeman who plies the sluggish southern rivers, come to know one another not by sight, but by a shared story whispered on the wind. For this unity is not a thing proclaimed by heralds, but is grown quietly from the soil of common custom and shared grievance. The memory of a past king's folly, or the pride in a victory hard-won, serves as the unseen sinew that binds the disparate limbs into one body. What was once but a parcel of separate lands, each jealously guarding its own borders and its own bread, now feels the faint, first stirrings of a single heart, whose rhythm, though yet unsteady, promises a future held in common.
