For so many seasons I did count thee amongst the silent dead, a ghost to be mourned at twilight and a name whispered only to the unpitying moon. My heart, a barren plot of land long since salted by grief, had made its solemn peace with emptiness and given o'er all hope of a new spring. Yet here thou art, with breathing flesh and troubled eye, a spectre made miraculously whole. What strange magic is this that plucks a soul from the unyielding maw of that great darkness and plants it, living, back upon the earth? I had sooner believed the very sea should give up its drowned mariners, or that the stars themselves might fall to walk amongst us as common folk. Prithee, speak once more, for my mind is a vessel tossed upon a storm of disbelief, and only the sound of thy true voice may convince my wits that this is no waking dream sent to plague my final years.
