Why dost thou front me with that saintly mien, as if thy soul were spun of purest light and mine some wretched, muddy thing? I know thee, sir, for all thy gilded words and public prayers. You move amongst these simple folk a painted angel, scattering coin and gentle courtesies, yet I have seen the ledger of your heart, whose every page is black with cunning spite. Dost thou imagine none can see the rot that festers 'neath that pious cloak? They praise the shepherd’s staff in thy right hand, but I alone have spied the serpent coiled about thy arm. You are a hollow tomb, most fairly wrought without, but full of stinking bones and dead men’s dust within. So spare me, friend, this virtuous masquerade; it fools not the man who knows the skull beneath the skin.
