Magistrate Pumble, a man whose wisdom was measured chiefly by the girth of his own waistcoat, did at last pronounce his verdict with a mighty clearing of his throat. The case, which had vexed the village for a fortnight, concerned one stolen cabbage of prodigious size, claimed by both Farmer Giles and the widow Oakhaven. Seeing no path for simple reason, the magistrate declared that the cabbage itself should be the arbiter of its fate. It was to be placed upon the very boundary stone betwixt their lands, there to remain until the first frost; whichever party’s pig did first consume the vegetable would thereby prove its master’s honest claim. The townsfolk nodded, much impressed by this profound test of Providence, whilst Giles and the widow exchanged a look of pure and murderous intent, each one knowing their own hog to be the most gluttonous beast in the shire, and both already plotting a midnight feast.
