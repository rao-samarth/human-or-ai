Yet the city, forsooth, had other humours entirely. Ere he could clear his throat, a swine escaped its bonds and did run amok amongst the throng, causing a pyramid of fine melons to meet a sudden and grievous end. From a high window, some unseen varlet then emptied a pail of questionable water, which narrowly missed the Alderman’s pate but didst wholly drench a nearby fortune-teller’s cat. He puffed his chest, a weary galleon assailed by gnats, and feigned a sovereign calm, his voice attempting to soar above the squealing of the pig and the hissing of the feline. Alas, what man wouldst bear this heavy chain of office, where he must command the tides of men whilst being vexed by every stray beast and dripping eave in the parish?
