Alas, poor Colin’s constancy, which but a sennight past seemed as fixed as the northern star, now proves a thing of gossamer and whey. His Phillida, a maid of simple wit and peerless complexion, hath given ear to the poisonous whisperings of a rival shepherd, one whose tongue is smoother than his heart is true. This serpent did convince her that Colin’s prize ram, whose fleece is whiter than the driven snow, is in fact an enchanted beast, and that its bleating doth cast a glamour upon her senses, forcing her affection where it would not naturally grow. And so she, poor fool, now flees from Colin’s sight, mistaking his honest love for base sorcery and his prized animal for a horned devil. Her love, once a sturdy sapling, is felled by the axe of a single, ridiculous lie, proving a heart’s devotion may be undone by no more than a fool’s tale told of a sheep.
