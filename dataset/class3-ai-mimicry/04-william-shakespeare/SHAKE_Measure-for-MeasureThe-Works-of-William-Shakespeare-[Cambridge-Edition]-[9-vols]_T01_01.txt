By this cold and windswept road I have him fast, this wretched thief who thought my purse his prize. The law, that iron-hearted judge of men, doth cry for satisfaction; it demands the rope, a final, public dance for such a paltry sum, and my own aggrieved heart would see it so. For what is a kingdom but a house of cards if pilfering hands may pull the props away? Yet, as he kneels in dust and begs not for his life but for the babes his crime was meant to feed, a contrary spirit rises in my breast. His transgression, born of desperate want, now seems a lesser fault than the pitiless decree I am bid to execute. Shall I be the instrument of a necessary cruelty, a stone that helps to build the wall of order? Or shall I, in one moment’s pardon, risk a greater ill for a private good, and show a grace that Heaven itself might scorn as folly? The path forks here, and I stand frozen, a judge with no true law to guide him.
