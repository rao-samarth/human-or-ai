Hark, what a change was wrought by Master Hemlock’s tongue! Our spirits, late so heavy-laden with the week’s dull toil, didst find a sudden lift, as if his words were wings. He spake not of the grim accounts that lay in dusty piles, nor of the long hours yet to come; nay, he painted with his breath a vision of our common enterprise, a future built by our own hands, so bright it made the flickering candlelight seem like the dawn. He called us not mere labourers, but partners in a noble venture, whose diligence would soon be crowned with such reward as we had scarce dared to dream. And in that moment, forsooth, a fire was kindled where before were only embers; we looked upon our weary fellows and saw a company of kings, each man’s heart now stout enough to move a mountain ere the morning bell.
