Alas, what poor and shifting ground is this whereon a sacred vow is built? This heart, which swore itself a loyal subject to a golden-haired and gentle maid, now plays the rebel for a passing glance from one whose laugh is like the brook in spring. The very air, methinks, doth carry forth her scent, and chides my memory of oaths so lately made beneath this selfsame sun. Was that great passion but a summer's fever, a fleeting madness now cooled by this new autumn air? To break a troth is to undo my soul, and make me villain in a tale of my own writing; yet to feign a fire where only dying embers lie is a cruelty of a far more grievous kind. I stand between two paths beneath this weeping willow, and know not which one leads to greater ruin, nor which to but a different sorrow.
