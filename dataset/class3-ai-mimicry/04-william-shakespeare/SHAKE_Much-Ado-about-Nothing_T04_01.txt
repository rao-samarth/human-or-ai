Amidst the market's clamour and the braying of the costermongers, he found her gaze, a challenge fairly thrown. "So, you are come to poison the city's air with sighs and sour looks," he began, his voice a low thunder above the din. She offered a smile that held no mirth, but the keen glint of a drawn blade. "Nay, good sir, I leave that sorry office to your own ponderous wit, which hangs so heavy it might curdle the very air. Dost thou not find this throng a fitting chorus for thy boasts?" He drew a step nearer, the rabble parting round them like a river 'round a stone. "My boasts? I speak but plainest truth, a tongue you have long since forsworn for gilded lies and serpent's coils of phrase. Your heart is a fortress walled with cleverness, and I mean to lay siege to it with nought but honesty." Her laughter was a brittle music. "Then you shall find it a long and fruitless war, for your honesty is a blunted spear against so well-guarded a gate."
