Hark what a caterwauling doth afflict the midnight hour! The master, in his most excellent and novel wisdom, hath declared the house a commonwealth, where every scullion and footboy may speak his mind as lord. A fine notion, forsooth, for a philosopher’s idle dream, but ruinous to a well-kept hall. Now see the fruits of such liberty: the hounds feast upon the damask cloths, the port is broached and swill’d by grinning stable-hands, and my lady’s youngest practises her lute for a drunken tinker in the gallery. The old man snores above, content in his magnanimous folly, having given the keys to the asylum inmates. He wished for every voice to be heard, and now he hath it—a chorus of misrule and gluttony, a symphony of chaos where the very timbers of this house seem to groan for a firm hand to fall, and fall hard.
