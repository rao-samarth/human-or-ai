This jolting cart, my only kingdom now, doth give me leave to ponder how our house did fall to ruin. We were not besieged by any outward foe, nor undone by fortune’s cruelest turn; nay, the breach was made from inside our own walls, where malice, like a patient ivy, choked the stone. My cousin’s envy and my uncle’s pride were but the twin seeds of that bitter vine, which I myself did water with contempt. For what prize did we wage this brutish war? For a patch of earth? For a slight remembered from some forgotten feast? We sharpened words like daggers at the hearth and poisoned the very air our children breathed. Now the great hall stands empty of all mirth, its treasures scattered, and I, a banished wretch, am left to count the cost upon a beggar’s road, with naught but the dust of our self-made destruction to fill my mouth.
