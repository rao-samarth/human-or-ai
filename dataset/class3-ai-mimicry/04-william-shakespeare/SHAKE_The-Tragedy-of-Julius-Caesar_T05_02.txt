We rode past Hallowdale, or what was once that name, where now but a charnel-house of blackened timbers greets the mournful sky. My companion, a green youth with a stomach for naught but sweetmeats, turned his face away. He sees only the ruin, the ghost of a baker’s boy slain at his own hearth; he doth not perceive the grand design for which this lesser sacrifice was made. Hath not a gardener cause to uproot the choking weed, though the weed itself hath life? These people were a blight, a stubborn canker upon the realm’s true flesh, and we who dreamt of a more virtuous dawn did naught but apply the necessary fire to purge the sickness. Let them call us tyrants. A new world is not born from a gentle womb but is ripped bloody from the old, and its first cries are ever mistaken for the screams of the dying.
