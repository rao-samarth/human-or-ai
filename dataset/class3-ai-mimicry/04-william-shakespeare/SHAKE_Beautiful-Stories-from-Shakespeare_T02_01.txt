Methinks this hall, though bright with candle-flame and loud with music, is but a well-appointed tomb. I watch the sons of one great house pass by the daughters of another, their faces set like stone, and a courtesy exchanged between them so cold it might freeze the very air. What trifle, what forgotten insult from a grandsire’s time, first planted this bitter root? None can now say, yet the vine of their mutual scorn hath choked all goodly sentiment, entwining hearts that might otherwise have known accord. Their quarrel is a ghost that haunts the feast, a sour note in the melody, poisoning the wine in their cups and turning this fellowship into a silent, grievous pantomime of war. The fathers’ sin thus becomes the children’s curse, a shadow from which they cannot flee, even in a room so filled with light.
