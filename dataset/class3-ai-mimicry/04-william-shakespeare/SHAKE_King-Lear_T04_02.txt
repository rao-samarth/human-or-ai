Hath any man truly known the mettle of his own soul, who hath not first been hammered upon misfortune’s anvil? I think not. For in the sun-bright days of ease and plenty, we are but pleasing fictions to ourselves, adorned with vanities and hollow boasts. But let the tempest of despair descend upon our humble roofs, let the bitter cup be drunk to its last dregs, and this feigned character doth fall away like rotten cloth. It is then, in the stark and silent wilderness of sorrow, that a man is forced to turn his eyes inward, having no other landscape left to view. There, in that desolate place, he discovers the true architecture of his spirit, not the one he built for public show, but the one which God and sorrow have revealed. Such cruel tutelage proves the surest path to wisdom, showing us not what we would be, but what, in truth, we are.
