Goodwife Audley doth carry her piety about the village as a fine lady might her perfumed handkerchief, a thing to be displayed for all to admire. Her face, a mask of solemn grace, is ever turned toward the church spire, and her purse, though whispered to be heavy, opens only with a great and sorrowful show for the most public of beggars. Yet I have watched her from my window when the lanes are empty; I have seen the flint that hardens in her eye when a tenant comes pleading for more time, a look that would sour milk and curdle charity itself. Forsooth, the world is but a stage, and she hath learned her part most perfectly, playing the gentle lamb whilst a wolf's hunger doth gnaw within her soul. The common folk see but the painted scenery of her goodness, never questioning the mean and hollow space that lies behind the counterfeit wall.
