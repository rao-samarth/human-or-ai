The governor, a man of stout and sober habit, doth call him lunatic for his strange humours and vacant stare. Forsooth, the clerk no longer tallies the columns of gold nor reckons the accounts with his wonted diligence; instead, he gazes into the very ink upon the page as if it held the secrets of the firmament. His fellows whisper that his wits have flown, that the endless scrawling of figures hath at last undone the fragile bindings of his mind. Yet in this supposed unreason, a new vision is born. He sees not sums, but the hollow heart of their enterprise; he hears not the clinking of coin, but the rattling chains of men who trade their days for dust. They see a mind unhinged and shattered, a vessel cracked and emptied of its purpose. But perchance it is the world’s own sense that is the greater malady, and his fractured perception but a window, jagged and strange, through which a terrible and brilliant truth at last doth shine.
