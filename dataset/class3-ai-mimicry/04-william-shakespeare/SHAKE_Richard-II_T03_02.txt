The hour grows late, and my candle sputters as if in sympathy with my own weary spirit, casting long shadows that do mock the state of things. What husbandry is this, that allows such choking weeds of discontent and foul corruption to usurp the sun from every noble stock? The very soil, which once promised a bounteous harvest for the common good, now brings forth only thorns and bitter fruit, leaving the people to starve for want of wholesome fare. Our keeper, it seems, sleeps soundly whilst base creatures and crawling things despoil the beds, and every virtue that once did blossom fair is trod to earth or left to wither on the vine. Wherefore hath such a pervasive rot taken hold of our estate, and who, I ask you, shall come with scythe and spade to set this tangled wilderness to rights once more? It is a heavy thought for such a dark and silent night.
