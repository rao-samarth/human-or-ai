As we journey upon this dusty road, I mark the lads whose chins have yet to welcome a full beard; they march with fire in their eyes, their heads filled with naught but visions of bright banners and a king’s gratitude. Forsooth, the poets and the balladeers do spin a handsome yarn of chivalry, where every sword-stroke is a note in some heroic ballad and death itself is but a noble sleep upon a bed of honour. Yet I have trod those very fields when the music hath long ceased and the crows hold their grim court. What then of glory? I find it not in the stiffened limbs half-sunk in mire, nor in the mud that cakes a once-proud face, nor in the final groans that heaven itself seems not to hear. They speak of a crown of laurels for the victor, but I have known only the wretchedness of survival, a prize that tastes of ash and is paid for with a piece of one’s own soul.
