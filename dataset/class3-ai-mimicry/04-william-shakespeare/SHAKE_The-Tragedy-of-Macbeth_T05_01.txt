As our weary horses trod the dust of this afflicted land, a question did plague my mind, for I saw a difference writ plain in the barren fields and the hollow eyes of the common folk. One man may wear a crown and be the very soul of the kingdom, a loving physician who ministers to its health and sees his own strength in the vigour of his subjects. His command is but the law given voice, a shield for the weak and a guide for the strong. Yet another may sit upon the selfsame throne and be a fever in the state's blood, a creature of boundless appetite whose private will becomes a sword against the very people he is sworn to cherish. Such a one consumes the realm for his own glory, mistaking fear for loyalty, and leaves behind him a ruin to be his monument. To which master, then, doth this desolate road now lead my soul?
