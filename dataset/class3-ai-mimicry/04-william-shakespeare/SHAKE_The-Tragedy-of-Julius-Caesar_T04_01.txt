The sun warms this old stone wall where I sit, and the clamour of the city's great men doth reach here only as a faint and distant hum. They say a man with a voice of honeyed thunder may sway a thousand souls at once, leading them with promises as bright and hollow as a bubble on the stream. Such a one might fashion a kingdom from the breath of his listeners, building high walls of fear and grand palaces of false hope. Yet I have watched the stubborn oak stand fast against the storm's loudest fury, and have seen the smallest flower find its own sure path to the light. So too, I hold, shall the simple, unadorned truth, which speaks not to the ear but to the very soul, at last outlive the grandest oration. For a man's own conscience, when he but attends to it in the quiet field of his heart, is a truer guide than any sovereign's gilded proclamation.
