The honest tongue is silent, whilst the flattering voice doth sing a constant, pleasing tune into his ear. He sits alone upon his height, mistaking the echo of his own decree for the people's true consent, and thus, I fear, a worthy soul is slowly lost within the gilded cage of his own sovereign will.
