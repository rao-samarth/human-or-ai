Pray, madam, have done with such a carefully wrought sorrow, for this quiet pasture is no royal court that you must needs instruct it in the art of weeping. You fashion your despair into a public monument, and even the wind that stirs the grass seems to learn its mournful part from you. Hath your heart no private chamber for its ache, that it must ever be upon display, dressed in the grand robes of tragedy for all the world, or even for these dumb beasts, to witness? What you call feeling, I call a practiced masque! The lady turned, her face a pale moon in the fading light. “Thou, who hast known only common sorrows, canst not perceive the truth of mine. This countenance I wear is not a lie, but rather the last remaining rampart of my state; should it fall, and my true ruin show itself, what then were left of me? A queen must grieve as a queen, sir, else she is but a woman, and a woman’s tears are soon forgot.”
