Along this endless, winding track, where dust chokes every throat, my conscience finds no peace, for it is a battleground of two great kings. The law, a stern and unbending sovereign, proclaims this captive’s doom; his life is forfeit, a just price for taking arms against our state. A stern decree, and one well-founded, for reason’s cold light shows his guilt writ plain. Yet when I look upon his trembling form, a mere youth pulled from his mother’s hearth to serve a tyrant’s will, a softer counsel whispers in my soul. Hath he not a heart that beats like mine? Doth he not bleed? To send him to his final sleep serves the state’s cold need, but what of that higher court, the one that judges not the deed but the heart’s true and piteous intent? Alas, the sword of retribution is heavy, and my hand grows weak to lift it when a tear of pity falls upon the steel.
