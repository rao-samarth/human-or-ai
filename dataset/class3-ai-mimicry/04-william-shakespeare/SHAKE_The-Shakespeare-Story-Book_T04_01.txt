Hark, what sweet fellowship doth bloom in yonder fields, where two good men, whose fathers tilled the same poor soil, do clasp their hands in honest brotherhood! Or so the simple eye would judge it. But mark how one doth prosper whilst his neighbour's crop lies thin; see how the fatter purse doth breed a leaner friendship. The pleasantries, once freely given, are now but bitter herbs served with a curdled smile. Soon, a whispered word, a lie as subtle as a serpent in the grass, shall find its way to market, and the good man’s name will be as blighted as his corn. Forsooth, a loyal friend is a precious thing, yet friendship’s coin is ever spent most freely when one’s own coffer is quite bare. Such is the pastoral virtue we are bid to praise; a virtue that withers at the first glint of another’s gold, and proves a man's heart to be the most barren ground of all.
