Upon this winding road, I have heard many tongues, some tipped with honey’d poison, others sharp with a false praise that bites more than it soothes. In a crowded inn, I saw a man whose speech was like a silken net, so finely wrought with flattery and seeming reason that many honest souls were near ensnared. He could paint ruin as a paradise and make a cage seem a kingdom with but a clever turning of a phrase. Yet I take heart, for I have seen such artifice fail when met with a simple, unadorned “nay.” Truth, I find, hath its own bright music, which, though it be played on a plainer instrument, doth ring more purely in the ear than all the clamorous discord of deceit. The sun wants no grand pronouncements to prove its warmth, and so too will a true word, in its own season, scatter the morning’s cunning mists.
