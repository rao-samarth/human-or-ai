By this last candle’s sputtering light, I find my mind still reeling from our late encounter. You came armed with such a volley of sharp-honed conceits that I, who fancied myself a master of the fray, was put quite on the defensive. I thought my tongue a nimble rapier, fit to parry any argument, but you didst turn my every point against me with a jest, and made a shield of laughter to repel my keenest barb. To be so soundly vanquished brings a sting, I grant you; yet must I confess, the art of my defeat was a spectacle more pleasing than any victory I might have snatched. Sleep you well, my sweet tormentor, for tomorrow I shall study some new stratagem to disarm that smile, though I much fear my heart hath already surrendered the field.
