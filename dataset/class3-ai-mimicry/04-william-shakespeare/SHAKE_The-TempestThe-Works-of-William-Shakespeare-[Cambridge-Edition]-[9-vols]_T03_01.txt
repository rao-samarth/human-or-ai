Mark how the music plays and the revellers dance, each one a monarch in his own conceit, and then proclaim this place a house of liberty. Yet look you closer, and see the unseen chains they wear, though forged of golden praise and whispered honours. Here, a man is bound fast by his good name; there, a lady is caged by the slender bars of courtesy. Every smile is a duty, every word a careful measure, lest they tumble from the high perch of their station into ruin. Wherefore do we call this state a freedom? Perchance the wretch who sits in a dark cell, with naught but his own soul for company, hath a wider and more boundless kingdom in his mind than all these lords possess. His thoughts may fly to any star they choose, whilst these poor souls must pace the narrow confines of their own importance, their spirits shackled fast to the world’s esteem.
