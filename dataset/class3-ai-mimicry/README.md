# Class 3 - AI **Prompted** Mimicry

 This class of the dataset contains 250 paragraphs per author, generated by Gemini 3 Pro (latest at the time of creation).

The topics of the 250 paragraphs span various overarching themes of our 4 authors. The themes are purposefully kept the same as that of Class 2. Reassurance of us using this can be found [here](../README.md).  

Here, we just prompt engineer Gemini to make it sound like the author himself. This is done by adding this line to the prompt: *"You must mimic the writing style of: {author_name}"*


I generated the paragraphs using [generator-script.py](generator-script.py).  



## Explanation of a few elements of code, and the choices we made

### Temperature Settings
- **Initial Generation**: `temperature=1.0` - High temperature to maximize diversity in style mimicry. Since we're generating 250 paragraphs per author, we need significant variation to prevent repetitive outputs.
- **Retry Attempts**: `temperature=1.1` - Slightly higher on retries to encourage the model to generate a different output if the first attempt failed word count validation.

The higher temperature (compared to Class 2's theme generation at 0.7) is intentional: style mimicry requires more creative freedom to capture the nuances of each author's voice while still producing diverse content across multiple paragraphs.

### Authors and Directory Structure

The script defines 4 authors (Arthur Conan Doyle, P. G. Wodehouse, William Shakespeare, and Mark Twain) and saves their generated paragraphs into separate subdirectories (`01-arthur-conan-doyle/`, `02-pg-wodehouse/`, `03-william-shakespeare/`, `04-mark-twain/`). Each author gets 250 paragraphs, distributed across 20 topics.

### Distribution Strategy

The 250 paragraphs per author are distributed unevenly across 20 topics to add variation:
- 10 topics get 13 paragraphs each
- 10 topics get 12 paragraphs each

This is randomized using `get_counts_per_topic_for_author()` to ensure different topics get the higher count for each author.

### Prompt Engineering for Style Mimicry

The core of Class 3 is making the AI mimic specific author styles. The `build_prompt()` function includes:
- **Style constraints**: Explicitly instructs the model to imitate the author's voice (sentence rhythm, vocabulary, tone, punctuation habits) without mentioning the author's name or copying from existing works
- **Diversity modes**: 18 different modes (reflective monologue, dialogue scene, descriptive narrative, etc.) randomly applied to ensure variety
- **Settings**: 10 different settings (small town, crowded city, workplace, etc.) to prevent repetitive scenarios
- **Anti-AI detection**: Explicitly avoids overused AI phrases like "tapestry," "delve," and "testament"

### Memory and Repetition Prevention

The script maintains `topic_history` tracking the last 5 paragraphs for each (author, topic) pair. It passes snippets from recent outputs to the model with instructions to "avoid repeating these recent ideas," reducing redundancy within the same topic.

### Cleaning and Validation

The `clean_output()` function removes titles, quotes, and extra formatting that Gemini sometimes adds. The script validates word count (100-200 words) and retries up to 2 times if the output doesn't meet requirements, with increased temperature on retries to encourage different outputs.
