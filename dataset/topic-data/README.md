# Topics / Themes from each of the books

Every selected book has 5 themes, generated by Gemini as part of the "2-pass" approach (explained in [../class2-ai-written/README.md](../class2-ai-written/README.md)).  

I have manually cross verified every single theme, and they seem to be okay. Some were slightly provocative, and triggering safety triggers in Gemini. Those books entirely have been removed.  

### Side Note

I apologise for the bad formatting of the csv's here. Ideally, I would have added booknumber as well, but I forgot and generated all of them already. Also, since each author has a numbering system independent of the other authors in my setup, it would be confusing over here.  

I will add the author name-prefixes and book names to each of the titles, and ensure that the titles are not read by the classifier, for the same. That way, for an observer, a correlation can be quickly made between the authors, the books, and the csvs...
