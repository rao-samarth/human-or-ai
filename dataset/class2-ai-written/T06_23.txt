Kevin had sworn all he knew was *“dos cervezas, por favor.”* Yet here he was, leaning against a stall of cured meats in the Barcelona market, deep in what appeared to be a heartfelt conversation with the vendor about her grandson’s football career. He even got a free slice of *jamón ibérico*, which he waved at me with a triumphant, greasy grin. I, on the other hand, had just spent ten minutes practicing how to ask for the price of some figs, only to have the woman point at the sign with a tired sigh when I finally got the words out. It was a perfectly legible sign. I stood there, my carefully rehearsed Spanish phrases dissolving in my head, watching Kevin get invited behind the counter to inspect a wheel of manchego. He was probably getting a better deal, a more authentic experience, a secret local recipe. I bet his ham was better than my ham would ever be.
