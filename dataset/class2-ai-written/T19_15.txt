My uncle launched into his famous story about the runaway lawnmower, and the living room filled with the sound of dutiful laughter. We all knew the punchline, having heard it at every major holiday for the last decade, but we performed our amusement anyway.

No one mentioned the firm's recent restructuring, or the fact that his position had been eliminated two weeks ago. This shared meal wasn't about catching up; it was a collective, unspoken agreement to maintain the illusion of stability for a few more hours, a fragile stage where everyone knew their lines and played their part perfectly.
