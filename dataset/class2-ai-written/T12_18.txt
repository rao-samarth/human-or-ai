It all started with the old Miller property down by the river. For years, it was just a ruin, but we all had this shared dream of turning it into a park. A real one, with a playground and benches where you could watch the water. Then the developers from the city came to the town hall meeting with their glossy pamphlets and promises of a luxury condo complex. I watched it happen in real-time. Suddenly, it wasn't about a park anymore. Jim, who runs the lumber yard, was quietly told he’d get the framing contract. Sarah was offered a prime retail spot on the ground floor for her bakery. They started talking differently, using words like ‘opportunity’ and ‘realism,’ and they never quite looked me in the eye when they said it. It was amazing, and a little sad, to see how cheaply a shared dream could be bought, piece by individual piece.
