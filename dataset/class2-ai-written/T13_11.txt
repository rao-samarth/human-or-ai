Arthur Finch had overseen the construction of the new town square gazebo personally, dismissing any well-meaning advice with a wave of his hand. For weeks, he’d held court at the diner, explaining the superiority of his methods and the permanence of his work. His certainty was an architectural element in itself, solid and unyielding. Then came the first serious autumn downpour. A steady, embarrassing drip began to fall precisely in the center of the structure, forming a dark puddle on the new floorboards. The flaw was undeniable, a single point of failure that invalidated all the grand speeches. Now, Arthur no longer takes his usual route past the square; his walks are shorter, his posture slightly stooped. The gazebo, intended as a symbol of his lifelong mastery, has instead become a quiet, public reminder of a single, crucial oversight.
