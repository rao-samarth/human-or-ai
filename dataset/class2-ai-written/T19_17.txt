The creek behind our properties has always been my quiet place, sunlight filtering through the oak leaves to dapple the clear, moving water. That’s why seeing Mr. Henderson there felt so wrong. He wasn't admiring the minnows or checking for erosion like he always claimed during town meetings; he was wrestling a heavy, unlabeled drum toward the bank, the metal groaning in the quiet afternoon. I froze behind a sycamore as he tipped it, a dark, oily liquid slithering into the current and leaving a rainbow sheen on the surface. Our eyes met across the water. He, the man who wrote letters to the editor about protecting our local watershed, just gave a slight, almost imperceptible shake of his head. It wasn't a denial, but a silent instruction. I was to keep walking, to preserve the image of this perfect little corner of the world, even if the truth was now poisoning it from the source.
