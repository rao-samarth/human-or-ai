Out here in the quiet, you learn the real rules pretty quickly. The farmer stomps around his coop, shotgun gleaming after a fox got a hen, muttering about making things right. It’s a wonderful performance of righteous indignation, as if the fox was acting on some grand moral failing instead of simple, unapologetic hunger. The only real difference between a righteous execution and a simple meal is who owns the property. It’s all so clear. The farmer will wring another hen’s neck for his own Sunday dinner and call it providence, but when a wild creature does the same, it’s a capital offense demanding a bloody settlement. Fairness, it seems, is just a fancy word for getting what you want and having a good story to tell yourself about it afterwards.
