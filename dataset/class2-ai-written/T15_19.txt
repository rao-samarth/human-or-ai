Aunt Carol is laughing so hard she’s snorting. Everyone else is caught up in some story about property taxes, but they’re missing the real conversation happening in this house. It’s the low, insistent drone from the kitchen. That isn’t just a motor. There’s a rhythm to its cycling, a distinct pattern of clicks and whirs that wasn’t there last week, and I’m the only one who seems to notice. It’s a warning, I’m almost sure of it. My cousin keeps trying to get my attention, waving a half-eaten sausage roll in my direction, but his words are just static against the crucial signal. I just nod and smile, inching my way toward the kitchen door. They think I’m going for another drink. They have no idea I’m the only one here who’s actually listening.
