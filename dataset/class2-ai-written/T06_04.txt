Sarah Jenkins has a laugh that carries all the way across the post office parking lot. It’s a practiced sound, I’m sure of it, designed to make people turn and smile. And they do. She’s only been here a year, yet Mr. Henderson from the hardware store practically trips over himself to help carry her bags, and the young woman at the bakery always has a scone saved for her, just in case. No one’s life is that seamless. I watch from my car sometimes, just for a minute, and see how the light from the bakery catches her hair. It’s the way my own husband, Mark, will mention seeing her at the market, his voice a little too casual, that makes a cold little knot tighten in my stomach. He doesn’t see the calculation in her eyes that I do. It’s all a show, and I'm just waiting for the curtain to fall.
