The keynote speaker, a renowned astrophysicist, was meant to be the highlight of the evening gala, but his laptop had other plans. As he connected it to the main projector, the enormous screen behind him flickered to life not with images of distant galaxies, but with a full-screen, high-definition photo of a fluffy cat wearing a tiny sombrero. A nervous titter went through the audience. The professor, completely flustered, began clicking furiously, which only succeeded in cycling through an entire album titled "Mr. Snuggles' Fiesta." With each new photo—Mr. Snuggles in a poncho, Mr. Snuggles next to a bowl of guacamole, Mr. Snuggles asleep on a guitar—the polite chuckles grew into waves of unrestrained laughter. The distinguished scientist could only stand there, silhouetted against the colossal image of a cat in a sombrero, a victim of his own catastrophic presentation error.
