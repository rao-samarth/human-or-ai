Alex cleared his throat, beaming with the confidence of someone who had completed exactly three Duolingo lessons. He wanted to compliment the matriarch of the tiny trattoria on her life-altering ravioli. Catching her eye, he gestured to his empty plate and declared loudly, in what he believed was flawless Italian, "Nonna, la sua capra è bellissima!" The fork clattered from the owner's hand. A hush fell over the other three tables. Ben, who had actually studied the language, felt a cold dread creep up his spine as he translated Alex's proud proclamation: "Grandmother, your goat is beautiful!" There was, of course, no goat. There was only a very insulted grandmother, her two very large sons emerging from the kitchen, and the sudden, pressing need for them to find a new town to stay in for the rest of the week. Their perfect little holiday spot was now permanently off-limits, all because of a misplaced farm animal.
