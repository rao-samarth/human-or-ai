Anyone passing through on a sunny afternoon would call this town idyllic. The storefronts along Main Street wear fresh coats of paint, a cheerful palette masking the weary slump of century-old timbers. It’s a collective agreement. People perform their neighborliness with a quiet, shared understanding that the performance is what holds everything together, a consensus that what is seen must be protected at all costs from what is felt. The friendly wave from a porch might conceal a foreclosure notice taped to the inside of the door; the town's pristine surface is a fragile skin stretched over countless private anxieties. It raises the question of which version is more genuine: the carefully maintained public story or the silent, individual truths that threaten to fracture it with a single careless whisper.
