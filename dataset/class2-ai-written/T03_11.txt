Anya paced the kitchen linoleum, the crumpled letter trembling slightly in her hand. "It’s not just about the debt, Lena. It’s about what Mr. Gable is saying to everyone at the market." Lena stared into her empty teacup, refusing to look up. "I panicked," she whispered, a small, pathetic sound in the late-night quiet. "A panic we now have to fix," Anya countered, her voice sharp. "I’ve already called them. I told them we'd cover the full amount. We’ll say it was a terrible clerical error on our end." Lena’s head snapped up, her eyes wide. "We can't! That’s our entire savings. We’ll have nothing left." Anya stopped pacing and leaned over the table, her knuckles white. "We'll have our name. After everything Dad worked for, that’s the one thing we are not going to lose."
