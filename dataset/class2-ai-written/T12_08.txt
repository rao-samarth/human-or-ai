The old stone wall runs exactly where it always has, cutting across the hill under the big oak. I know because I check it. Every morning, I used to look out at the Miller’s pasture, greener than mine, and a thought just took root in my mind. It wasn’t a complicated plan, nothing that would raise an alarm. A few stones shifted in the dead of night, a conveniently “rediscovered” survey map from my grandfather’s time, and a quiet word with the right person. I told myself they had more than they needed, that it was only a sliver of land, barely an acre that they’d never miss. But now when I stand on my porch and look out at that expanded view, all I see is the line that I moved. The extra land is mine and the deed is clear, but the silence out here isn't peaceful anymore. It feels like it’s waiting for me to admit what I did.
