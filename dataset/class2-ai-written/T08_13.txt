The old clock on the mantelpiece was the only thing making a sound, each tick a small, metallic judgment in the stillness. I’d spent hours staring at my faint reflection in the windowpane, tracing the lines of a face I barely recognized anymore. The law offered its own version of balance, an impersonal equation of time served for damage done, but the thought of it brought no comfort. What I truly wanted, in the darkest parts of the night, was for him to understand. Not just to be punished, but to feel the precise shape of the emptiness he had left behind. Yet even that desire felt like ash in my mouth. A simple exchange of pain for pain seemed too small, too easy, and I was left alone in the quiet, wondering who was ever meant to draw the line between making things even and simply making things worse.
