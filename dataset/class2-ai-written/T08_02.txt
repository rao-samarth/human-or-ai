Amid the ceaseless river of faces flowing down the avenue, it’s easy to imagine the countless ways one person can harm another. A careless shove, a bitter word, a broken trust—the city is filled with a million daily wounds, each one sparking that primal urge to strike back and even the score. But then you see a stranger help another who has stumbled, or watch the patient work of mediators resolving a dispute, and you sense a different, more powerful current at play. This is the slow, complicated effort of millions of people deciding, moment by moment, to build something together rather than simply tear things apart in anger. Real fairness isn't a simple balancing of scales through pain; it’s the constant, hopeful work of mending the communal structure so that everyone, not just the aggrieved, has a chance to move forward. It’s a choice we all make, in the quiet spaces between the sirens, to seek repair over retribution.
