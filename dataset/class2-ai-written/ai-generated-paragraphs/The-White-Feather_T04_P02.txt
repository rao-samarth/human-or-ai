The landscape from this train window is a blur of green and gold, and for some reason, it made me think of you. You remember that version of me, don't you? The one who thought the whole world was a tiny, airless room with no windows. I don't think I ever had a single breakthrough moment; there was no grand epiphany lighting the way forward. It was just the relentless, unglamorous work of chipping away at the walls, day after day, sometimes with nothing more than my own resolve. I didn’t even realize they were gone until I suddenly felt a breeze. And now, I’m sitting here, watching an entire country slide past my window, and I barely recognize the person who was trapped in there. It wasn’t magic, just the quiet accumulation of footsteps, I suppose, each one feeling insignificant until they finally added up to a real distance.
