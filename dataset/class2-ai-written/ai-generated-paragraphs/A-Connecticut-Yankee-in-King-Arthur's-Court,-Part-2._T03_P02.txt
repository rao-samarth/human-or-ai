My nephew was adamant that the new smart remote was a revolutionary upgrade, a single sleek wand to replace all clutter. “It’s intuitive, Grandpa!” he chirped, swiping a finger across its glossy, buttonless surface. My grandfather eyed the device with the same deep suspicion he reserved for plant-based sausages. He just wanted to find the football game. A series of frantic taps from my nephew brought up a yoga tutorial, then a weather app for a city in Finland. A desperate voice command summoned a documentary about sentient fungi. Finally, with a sigh that carried the weight of generations, Grandpa reached into the end table drawer and produced the original remote, a glorious brick of sticky plastic and reassuringly chunky buttons. Two precise clicks and the game was on. My nephew stood silently, holding his flawless piece of the future, utterly defeated by a device that still had battery corrosion on its terminals.
