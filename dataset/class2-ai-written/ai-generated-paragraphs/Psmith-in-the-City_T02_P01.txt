In this town, every lawn was a manicured green square, and every mailbox stood at precisely the same angle. On Tuesdays, the recycling bins lined the curb with military precision, a silent agreement everyone seemed to have signed at birth. But Elias found his own rhythm. He let dandelions bloom in his yard, seeing them not as weeds but as small, defiant suns. While others discussed the weather in predictable, polite circles, he carried a well-worn book of poetry, its pages soft with use. He knew they saw him as an oddity, a gear spinning just slightly out of sync with the town’s grand, monotonous clockwork. He didn't mind. He found a richer world in the quiet rebellion of an uncut lawn, a private universe thriving right there on the edge of their perfect, repeatable world.
