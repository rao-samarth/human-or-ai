“You said you were at the library!” My cousin’s voice sliced through the barbecue chatter, sharp and sudden. She thrust her phone forward, the screen glowing under the patio lights. It was a photo of my jacket, the one I was wearing right now, slung over a chair in a crowded downtown cafe, a timestamp clearly visible in the corner. My aunt gasped. My dad’s jaw tightened. I opened my mouth to protest—I *was* at the library, I’d just lent my jacket to a friend for an hour—but she was already swiping. “And look at this.” A text message, supposedly from me to her, admitting I was ditching studying. The words weren't mine. The phrasing felt stilted and wrong, but it was from my number. How? I felt the gazes shift, the silent jury of my family delivering its verdict before I could even mount a defense. She’d built the cage and locked the door with a few clever taps on a screen, leaving me rattling the bars.
