No, it’s not like I just wait for inspiration. God, if I did that, I’d have written about three sentences this year. It’s more like a construction project, honestly. You get the blueprint—that’s the outline, if you’re lucky. Then you just… show up every day and lay bricks. Some days you lay a hundred, and they're all straight and perfect. Other days you manage three, and they’re crooked, and you know you’ll have to tear them down tomorrow. The real work isn't the flash of genius; it's the grind of fixing the wobbly bits, making sure the whole structure doesn't collapse on itself. And then you have to convince someone to buy the house. That's the part nobody ever thinks about, trying to sell a thing made of your own sweat and doubt.
