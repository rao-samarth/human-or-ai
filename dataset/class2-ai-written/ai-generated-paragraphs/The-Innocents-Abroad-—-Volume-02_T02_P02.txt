From my vantage point near the podium, I watched them queue up. A woman, draped in a fortune of silk and emeralds, actually dabbed at her eyes with a cocktail napkin as she approached the display. They’d paid five thousand a plate for this privilege, to gaze upon the so-called "Shard of First Light"—a piece of quartz I’d bought from a gift shop in Arizona two years ago. I’d simply given it a name, a good story about a fallen star, and a velvet cushion to rest on. Look at them. Their faces are a study in pure, unadulterated reverence for a shiny rock. It’s almost a form of art, crafting belief out of thin air and polished stone. Their desperate hunger for meaning is almost touching, and certainly very, very profitable.
