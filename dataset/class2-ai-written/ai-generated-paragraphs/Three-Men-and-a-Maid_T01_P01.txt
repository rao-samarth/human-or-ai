I'm just trying to enjoy my overpriced latte in peace, but the guy at the next table is practically broadcasting his entire romantic comedy disaster for the whole coffee shop. He booked a last-minute flight to Portland to surprise the woman he’d been seeing for three months, a grand gesture he was sure would solidify things. He’s now telling his friend, very loudly, that he imagined a tearful reunion at her doorstep. Instead, he got a text message saying she was out of town for the weekend. The whole situation is just so… human. We build these elaborate blueprints for affection, these architectural marvels of hope, convinced that one perfect, dramatic move will solve the messy equation of two people. We follow some unwritten, insane script and then act shocked when the other person is improvising from a completely different play. It’s a special kind of madness we all seem to catch eventually.
