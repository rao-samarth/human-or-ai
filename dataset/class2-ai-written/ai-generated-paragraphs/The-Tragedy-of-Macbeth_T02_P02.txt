I’ve been spending a lot of time just watching the creek that cuts through the bottom of the property. It follows the same winding path it must have carved out centuries ago, and you get the sense that nothing could ever change its course. It just flows. But then you see how a single fallen log can alter the current, forcing the water to bubble up and find a new way around, and it makes you think. We lay out our lives with such intention, believing every choice is a deliberate step forward. Yet I can’t shake the feeling that we’re all just following the grooves already worn into the world by those who came before, and our biggest decisions are nothing more than small adjustments to an unchangeable flow. Do you ever feel like you're just navigating around the obstacles in a predetermined channel?
