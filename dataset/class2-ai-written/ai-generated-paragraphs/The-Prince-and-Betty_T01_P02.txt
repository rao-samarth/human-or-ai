Bartholomew cleared his throat, gesturing with a dramatic flourish to the canary-yellow convertible that was currently blocking the only two parking spots in front of the post office. "A little something for you," he announced, as if bestowing a knighthood instead of a transportation crisis upon the small town. Clara stared at the automotive beast, a machine built for coastal highways, not for dodging the legendary potholes on Elm Street. Her smile was a tight, painful-looking thing. Just then, Leo ambled over from his garden patch, dirt still smudged on his cheek. He didn’t say much, just held out a single, lumpy, deep-red tomato that smelled of sunshine. "Remembered you said you missed the kind your grandma used to grow," he mumbled, looking at his boots. The tense line of Clara’s mouth dissolved into a real, dazzling grin as she took the tomato, cradling it in her hands like it was a jewel, leaving Bartholomew and his very expensive, very yellow problem shimmering uselessly in the afternoon sun.
