In the crowded plaza of a city whose language I barely understood, I found a strange sort of clarity. I watched groups of friends laugh, families share food, and vendors haggle with a familiar ease, all part of a shared current of communal life. Yet, whenever that current brushed against me, it seemed to recoil. A server’s smile would become professional and brief. A space would open around me on a crowded bench. It was never overt hostility, but something quieter: a subtle re-categorization that placed me outside the circle of assumed belonging. I was an object of polite curiosity, a temporary feature of the landscape, but not a participant. The feeling wasn't anger, but a profound and wearying solitude, as if I were observing the world through a thick pane of glass that only I could perceive.
