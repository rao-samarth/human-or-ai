The whole patio went quiet the second my aunt asked where the money for the anniversary gift was. I saw my brother freeze, fork halfway to his mouth, with a look of pure, cornered panic I hadn’t seen since he was ten. They would have torn him apart. I knew it. A dozen little lectures disguised as 'concerned questions' about his finances and his future. So before I could even really think it through, the words were just out. “That was my fault. I got the dates mixed up and had to pull from that fund for a bill. It’s all on me.” The collective gaze shifted, a heavy blanket of disapproval settling squarely on my shoulders. I felt my mom’s disappointed stare from across the table, and my uncle just shook his head. But I watched my brother’s shoulders drop an inch, a silent, grateful breath escaping him. Yeah, I could take being the irresponsible one for an afternoon.
