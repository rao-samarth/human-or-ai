I watched Aunt Millie’s eyes go wide as I described the Peruvian village, the one I’d only ever visited through a documentary. It was almost too easy. She hung on every word, her hand fluttering to her chest when I got to the part about teaching the children to read. The clatter of cutlery and my cousins' shouting match in the other room just faded into a dull hum. It’s not cruel, what I do. It’s a gift, really. I give her a story better than my reality, a nephew she can be properly proud of instead of the one who just barely pays his rent. She doesn't need to know the closest I got to charity work last month was leaving a big tip for a pizza delivery guy. She gets to feel pride, and I get to avoid another one of her worried looks. Her simple faith is a kind of shelter, and I’m just helping her furnish it.
