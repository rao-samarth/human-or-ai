At the head of the table, he looks smaller than I’ve ever seen him, a wisp of a man swallowed by the high-backed chair.

We all hear the tremors beneath the floorboards, the low growl of ambition from the provinces, but we just keep raising our glasses. This whole elaborate performance, this gilded hall, feels like it’s built on a pane of thinning ice. And he, our future, is learning to dance.
