The crosswalk sign flashed its insistent white figure, but my feet were cemented to the pavement. Across the river of honking taxis and shuffling pedestrians, I saw him. He was laughing, hoisting a small child onto his shoulders, a child who wouldn't exist if things had gone differently a decade ago. Every brick I had laid to build this new life, this new name, suddenly felt like sand, ready to collapse under the weight of a single glance. I could turn, melt back into the anonymity of the crowd, and he would never know the ghost of a man he once knew was just fifty feet away. The light turned green. People jostled past me. To walk away would be a quiet confirmation of the coward I swore I'd left behind, but to cross the street felt like an act of arson, burning down the peaceful world he'd somehow managed to build from the ashes I had made.
