The heat made the air tremble over the long grass. Crickets chirped their relentless, stupid song. On the porch, one man’s elbow knocked a tin cup, splashing lukewarm whiskey onto his neighbor’s dusty boot. The neighbor didn't flinch. He just stared at the dark spot and said the sky wasn’t blue but a shade of sick gray. The first man, the spiller, disagreed vehemently. He called it indigo, like a bruise on God’s arm. Words, low and sharp, replaced the crickets' noise. Then, faster than a thought, the spiller stood. There was no lunge, no scuffle, just the flat crack of a pistol and the neighbor slumping sideways off his stool, a neat hole appearing in his worn shirt. The shooter stared at the body for a moment, then calmly righted the fallen cup. He sat back down, looked up at the vast, empty expanse above, and decided it was probably just blue after all.
