I’ve become quite the expert at train station anthropology; it’s a necessary skill for long layovers. You can piece together entire lives just by observing how people manage their luggage and their companions. Take the man across the platform, for instance, the one with the aggressively sensible walking shoes. He just handed his wife a bottle of water with the solemnity of a diplomat signing a treaty, and she accepted it with the strained patience of someone who specifically asked for sparkling. I’m positive this is the latest battle in a lifelong cold war over hydration preferences. He thinks he’s being thoughtful, a provider of essential liquids, while she’s quietly composing a mental list of every time he has failed to grasp a simple concept. They believe their little drama is private, but to the discerning observer, it’s a brilliant, silent stage play.
