That floorboard always creaks in the same spot, just outside the bedroom door. A familiar, three-note complaint in the deep quiet of the house. My grandfather fixed it once, or tried to, kneeling on the worn wood with a hammer and a pocketful of nails. He said some things just have a memory of how they used to be, and they'll always try to return to it. I think people are like that. We spend so much energy moving forward, creating new routines and new selves, only to find we're stepping on the same old spots in the dark. The same inherited anxieties, the same familiar patterns of thought, the same quiet echoes of conversations had in these rooms long before we were born. You can't ever truly escape the architecture of the place you came from.
