You could feel the energy shift in the office after the all-hands meeting. Our new director, a woman with an almost impossible amount of enthusiasm, had laid out her vision on a single, deceptively simple slide. It was just a circle labeled “Our True North,” but people clung to it. Walking back to our desks, I heard snippets of conversation—not about the practical hurdles or the budget, but about how this new purpose would change everything. They were already sketching out projects, their faces bright with a kind of sincere devotion. Some might call it naive, this collective leap of faith, but I saw it differently. For the first time in years, we weren't just clocking in; we were all pulling together toward a destination we had chosen to believe in, and that shared journey felt more valuable than any guaranteed outcome.
