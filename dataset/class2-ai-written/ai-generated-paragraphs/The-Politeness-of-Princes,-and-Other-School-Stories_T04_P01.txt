Aunt Carol cornered me by the dessert table, a slice of cheesecake trembling on her fork, and asked if I ever wondered what happened to him. *Him.* As if we all weren't in it together. I just smiled and told her people make mistakes, especially back then. What I didn’t say was that there was no mistake. There was only a plan, forged in a stuffy locker room and sworn on a shared bag of chips: one story, one voice, no matter what. It wasn’t even a question. When the fallout came, of course we all lied. That’s what you do. You don't let the whole world, especially judging relatives, pick apart the one thing that was real. You build a wall around your people and you don’t let anyone in, ever. She wouldn't get it.
