The clinking of glasses and the low hum of forced conversation at the mayor's annual fundraiser provided the perfect cover. Detective Miller, off the clock but never truly off duty, had his suspect. It wasn't the suspicious bulge in the man's jacket pocket, which could have been a phone, nor was it the furtive glances he kept shooting toward the kitchen doors. No, the damning evidence was the faint, almost imperceptible shimmer of truffle oil on his left eyebrow. Only a man who had shamelessly cornered the catering staff for a private, pre-emptive sampling of the risotto balls would bear such a mark. Miller mentally closed the file. The man was guilty of first-degree appetizer hoarding. His punishment would be a lifetime of Miller’s silent, withering disapproval from across the room and, more immediately, being subtly boxed out when the next tray of miniature crab cakes emerged. Justice, after all, had to be served, even if it was just hors d'oeuvres.
