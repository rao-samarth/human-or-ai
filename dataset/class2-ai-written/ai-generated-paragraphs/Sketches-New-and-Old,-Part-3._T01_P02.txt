You always told me it was simple. You do the right thing, no matter what. That’s what you said, standing right in this room. You drew a line in the sand for everyone. His voice was low, but each word was a carefully aimed stone. “And what happens when the sand is gone?” she shot back, her face pale. “What happens when there’s just water and you’re drowning? You talk about lines, about good and bad, like they’re solid things you can hold. But they're not. They’re just stories we tell children so they’ll sleep at night. Out there, with everything on the line, there was no ‘right thing.’ There was just a choice between two different kinds of wrong, two ways of losing. So don't you dare stand there on your dry land and tell me I should have just let myself sink.”
