The only sound is the low hum of the refrigerator. I catch my reflection in the dark kitchen window and for a second, I don't recognize myself. It’s just a shape, a stranger in my own home. Then my eyes adjust. Oh, right. That’s me. That's the face I present to the world, the one with the tired lines and the faint, permanent crease of a practiced smile. It’s a collection of expressions I’ve worn for so long they’ve settled in, like clothes left on a chair. But the person living behind this face, the one currently thinking these thoughts? That consciousness doesn't really have a look. It’s just this formless awareness, the same one that once inhabited a child’s body and will someday leave this older one behind. The face is just a temporary costume, and tonight it feels especially ill-fitting.
