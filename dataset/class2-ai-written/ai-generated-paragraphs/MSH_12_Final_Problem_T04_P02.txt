David shut the door with that soft click that always means something serious. I figured this was it, the recognition for the quarterly project. He sat down, steepled his fingers, and wouldn't look me in the eye, which was his classic tell for being impressed but not wanting to show it too early. He just let the silence hang there, probably waiting for me to get nervous. I didn’t. I earned this. I’d single-handedly salvaged the account when everyone else was ready to let it fail. They all saw it happen. Then he pushed the manila folder across the polished desk. It wasn’t a bonus confirmation. He started talking, using those dead corporate words—"misalignment," "documented incidents," "performance review." It was all there, my emails and project notes, just rearranged to look like incompetence. He’d built a cage out of my own work, and I had walked right into it without even realizing the door was closing behind me.
