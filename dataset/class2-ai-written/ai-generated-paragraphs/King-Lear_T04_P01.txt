Standing on the overpass, watching the streams of headlights bleed into one continuous river, it becomes clear the city is indifferent to any single crisis. Each car holds a life, a set of worries completely separate from your own. It's a humbling thought. When everything falls apart, when the structures you built your identity upon collapse, you are stripped down. What remains is no longer an employee or a partner, but a primary consciousness observing the uncaring flow. In that profound isolation, a different kind of awareness can take root. You begin to see your own resilience, not as a celebrated strength, but as the simple, stubborn act of continuing to breathe on a cold concrete bridge. It is a quiet, difficult clarity.
