Filing the police report for my stolen electric scooter felt like screaming into a void. The officer, bless his heart, had the sympathetic but ultimately useless expression of a man who'd heard this story a thousand times. He took my details, gave me a case number, and I knew that was the end of it; justice, in this city, was a bureaucratic shrug. But then, two weeks later, I saw it. My scooter, unmistakable with its ridiculous narwhal sticker, parked outside a downtown apartment building while the thief, a guy in a bright green food delivery jacket, hustled inside. I could have called the cops again and waited for the slow, grinding gears to maybe, possibly, turn. Instead, I ducked into a nearby craft store. Ten minutes later, armed with a family-sized container of ultra-fine purple glitter, I enacted my own verdict. It wasn’t about getting the scooter back anymore. It was about ensuring that for the next six months, every time that guy scratched his nose, he’d find a tiny, shimmering speck of my personal, fabulous retribution.
