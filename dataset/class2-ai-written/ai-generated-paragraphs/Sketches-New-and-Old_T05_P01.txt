The beep is back. It’s a quiet, unassuming chirp that materializes from the ambient silence every seventy-three seconds, a timing I’ve confirmed with my phone’s stopwatch. The sound is too high-pitched for a smoke alarm and too brief for a microwave timer, a fact which forces me to categorize the possibilities with a strange, detached focus. It could be a long-forgotten children's toy wedged behind a bookshelf, its battery in its final death throes. Or perhaps it’s the carbon monoxide detector in the basement, a device I haven’t thought about in years, now issuing a polite but firm warning of my impending doom. A third, more likely theory is that it’s nothing at all, a simple auditory hallucination brought on by fatigue. Yet, with each perfectly timed chirp, the search for its origin becomes a small, absurd quest, a ridiculous puzzle box I'm compelled to solve in the profound quiet of three in the morning.
