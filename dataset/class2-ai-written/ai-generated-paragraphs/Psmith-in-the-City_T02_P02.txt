In the weekly strategy meeting, a familiar rhythm had taken hold. Phrases like 'optimizing stakeholder value' and 'scalable solutions' were passed around the table like currency, each utterance reinforcing a shared understanding. Most nodded along, their contributions variations on the established theme. Yet, there was always a quiet resistance in holding back from that easy consensus. It wasn't about outright opposition, which was often counterproductive. Instead, it was the act of asking a question that reframed the premise, or suggesting an approach so simple it seemed to bypass the corporate lexicon entirely. This small act was a way of preserving an internal space, a refusal to let one’s own mental framework be fully colonized by the group’s. It was a silent, personal effort to ensure that when you looked at a problem, you were still seeing it with your own eyes.
