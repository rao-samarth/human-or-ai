The polite, rhythmic applause washes over the ballroom as he beams under the stage lights, a true captain of industry. A patriot, they call him. It’s funny, because his greatest act of patriotism involved auctioning off the country’s manufacturing spine to the highest foreign bidder, all for a handsome fee that now probably funds this very gala. The well-fed audience nods along to the praise, their portfolios undoubtedly plump from his ‘strategic divestments.’ He speaks of national pride, of sacrifice for the greater good, and they sip their champagne, entirely convinced. It’s a magnificent performance, really. Selling the family silver and then charging admission to watch you polish the empty cabinet.
