Look around this room, at all the smiling faces and polite laughter. You need to understand something very quickly. None of this is real friendship; it's a performance, and you're on the main stage. Every handshake is a calculation, every compliment a potential hook. They aren't interested in who you truly are, only in the story you present, and that story, once it’s written in their minds, is almost impossible to edit. So if an old acquaintance with a checkered past tries to greet you too warmly, you offer a brief, cool nod and you move on. If a rival whispers an inconvenient truth in your ear, you laugh as if it's a harmless joke. You must be the vigilant curator of your own myth, because letting a single crack show is an invitation for them to shatter the whole facade. Remember that. Your legacy is not built on your accomplishments, but on the unblemished perception of them, and that is a fragile, demanding thing to protect.
