Everyone who leaves this town talks about the horizon, about finally being able to drive without hitting a county line in twenty minutes. They don't understand the safety in knowing every crack in the pavement on Main Street. There's a certain calm in the way the morning train whistle is always a little sharp in the winter air, or how you can map the hours of the day by the changing shadows on the grain silo. Out there, they have endless choices, endless streets that lead to more streets. It sounds exhausting. Here, the map is already drawn for you; you just have to walk the lines. Some people see walls where I just see the edge of the picture, the part that makes everything inside it make sense.
