Of course we had to shut it down. You can't just hand people a printing press and expect them to understand the immense responsibility that comes with it; they simply aren't ready. They must first learn about structure, about the sanctity of the rule of law, before they can be trusted with destabilizing tools like a free press. It’s about teaching them proper governance and discipline, not indulging every emotional outburst that gets put to paper. It is for their own good, you see. Speaking of which, did you see the latest directive from the home office? They want us to file triplicate reports on stationery consumption. *Triplicate.* The audacity of it, meddling in our affairs from thousands of miles away as if we were children who can’t be trusted to manage our own inkwells. It's an absolute affront to our autonomy.
