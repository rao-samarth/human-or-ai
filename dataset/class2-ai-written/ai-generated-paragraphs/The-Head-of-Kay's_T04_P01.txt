Mrs. Gable from the bakery almost had it; I saw the flicker of doubt in her eyes. The way her gaze lingered, just a second too long over the counter, as if she could somehow see past the story I’d so carefully constructed. But I held firm, offering that easy smile I’ve perfected over twenty years of living here. In a town this small, it’s all about the performance. One tiny crack in the facade and the whispers begin, spreading like weeds from the post office to the pews on Sunday morning. They don’t care about the whole truth, not really. People just want a simple narrative, a reason to feel a little bit better about their own quiet compromises. I refuse to be their cautionary tale. So I’ll keep polishing this version of myself, making it shine so brightly it blinds anyone who dares to look too close. It’s exhausting, this constant maintenance, but what's the alternative? To be the one they all dissect over coffee? No, never.
