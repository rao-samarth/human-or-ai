It’s a moment of pure, unadulterated genius that only strikes after you've dragged a suitcase the weight of a small car across three different cobblestone streets. You realize, with the clarity of a prophet, that the seven "just in case" sweaters for your tropical vacation were perhaps a slight miscalculation. The solution, of course, is nothing short of revolutionary. You start wearing your clothes in layers, like a fashionable onion, proudly sporting three t-shirts and a jacket in the sweltering heat just to lighten the load for a few blocks. Then comes the masterstroke: abandoning a perfectly good pair of shoes in the hotel bin. It's a profound sacrifice, a strategic jettisoning of assets to ensure the mission's success. You feel like a brilliant general, not at all like someone who simply can't be bothered to pack properly.
