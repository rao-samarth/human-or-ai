It was here, on this train rattling through the dark, that it all finally clicked into place. For days I had been staring at the messages, trying to find some grand meaning in the words themselves—"eastern sun," "fourth bell," "final stop." They were just nonsense, a bit of theatrical misdirection. The fundamental mistake was assuming the sender was clever with language, a poet of crime. They weren't. They were obsessively practical. So I stopped reading the content and started looking at the structure, the timing. Why a message at 8:14, then another at 11:03, then 2:45? They weren't random. They matched station departure times, but for a different line running parallel to this one. The entire plan wasn't hidden in the text at all; it was laid out in the metadata, a secret schedule only a fellow traveler would ever think to check. He wasn't sending a riddle; he was broadcasting his itinerary.
