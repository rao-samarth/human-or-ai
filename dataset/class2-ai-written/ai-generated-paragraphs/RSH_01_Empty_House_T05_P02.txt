David is clicking through the presentation, his smile so genuine you could almost forget he’s the one who signs our paychecks. He’s selling the new wellness tracker as a gift, a tool to help us optimize our focus and prevent burnout. Everyone around the conference table is nodding, murmuring approval at the sleek interface and gamified progress bars. They see a benefit. I see a digital leash. I see the subtle language in the terms of service that grants access to keystroke patterns and flags any “unproductive” minutes. Sarah, next to me, is already reaching for her phone to download it. My throat feels tight. To object now would be to paint myself as the cynic, the one who isn't a team player. But to stay silent feels like handing him the keys, not just to the office, but to a part of ourselves we never agreed to put on the market.
