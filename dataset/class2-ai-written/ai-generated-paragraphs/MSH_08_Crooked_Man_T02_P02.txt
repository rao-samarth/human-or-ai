The clink of a spoon against ceramic. He always stirred his coffee like that, so damn confident. Everything came so easily to him—the praise, the corner office, the way people just seemed to orbit his light while I was stuck in the shadows. I only wanted to see a crack in the perfect facade, just a little proof he was human like the rest of us. All it took was one quiet word in the right ear. One small, true thing he’d trusted me with, twisted just enough to look like a weapon. He fell, of course. Harder than I expected. And now I sit here, watching strangers share jokes, and the only thing I truly own is the echoing silence he left behind.
