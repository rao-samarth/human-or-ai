The long grass whipped against our legs as we ran, the morning birdsong swallowed by the thunder of our own feet. A single horn blast had torn the silence, and now we were a river of steel and shouting, pouring down the gentle slope. Sunlight flashed from a thousand spear points, a breathtaking, blinding constellation that promised an epic end to a perfect day.

The rhythmic pounding of boots became a chaotic stumbling in the mud. I saw a boy I knew from home fall, his mouth a silent O of surprise, as the scent of crushed clover was overwhelmed by the hot, metallic smell of blood. It was all over in a minute, but that minute held both the most magnificent and the most hideous thing I had ever seen.
