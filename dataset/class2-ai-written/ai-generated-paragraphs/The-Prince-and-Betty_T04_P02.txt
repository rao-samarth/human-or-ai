The evening rush swept past me, a river of anonymous faces under the neon glow. It’s funny, isn't it? How easy it is to become just another shadow here. I think about the person I was in that meeting this afternoon—poised, confident, agreeing with just the right amount of enthusiasm. Then I remember the version of me from last night, sympathetic and understanding, carefully listening to a story I couldn't care less about. They are all me, I suppose, but none of them are. Each one is a key cut for a specific lock, a carefully constructed role designed to get me where I need to go. It feels less like lying and more like… strategic editing. You show people the part of you they need to see. They get what they want, and I get what I need. Everyone is playing a part in this city; my costume just happens to be more convincing than most.
