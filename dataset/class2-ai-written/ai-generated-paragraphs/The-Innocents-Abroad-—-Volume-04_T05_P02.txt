I just don't understand how you can accept it all so completely. You never stopped to question a single part of the story, did you? It’s not even about whether they were lying; it's that you never demanded proof or even basic consistency. People build these neat, compelling narratives because the truth is often complicated and unsatisfying, and they know we crave simplicity. So we latch onto the easy answer. The danger isn't just in being wrong; it's in forgetting how to think for yourself. When you willingly hand over your skepticism, you give someone else the authority to define what’s real for you. That kind of unthinking devotion is a comfort, I get that, but it's a fragile one. Eventually, it shatters against something hard and undeniable, and you're left with nothing but the consequences of a belief you never truly examined.
