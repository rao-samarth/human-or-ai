Walking through downtown at rush hour feels like swimming against a current of pure self-interest. Everyone’s got their head down, their elbows out, just trying to get ahead. You see it in the little things: someone stealing your cab, a shopkeeper short-changing a tourist, the loud arguments over nothing. It’s a constant pressure to just join in, you know? To cut that corner, to ignore the person who needs help, to decide that your own agenda is the only one that matters. But I find myself holding onto these small, almost defiant acts of decency. Holding a door, making eye contact and smiling, letting someone go ahead of me in line. They feel like tiny anchors in a storm, little reminders to myself that the world might be transactional, but I don't have to be.
