Sitting here in the quiet of my own home, the city lights just a distant glow, it’s strange to think about the invisible lines that connect me to millions of others I will never meet. It’s not a bond of blood, or even of direct experience, but something else entirely. It's the shared resonance of a single anthem sung in a crowded stadium, the echo of history in the names of streets, the unspoken understanding in a shared joke. This feeling defies simple logic. How can a symbol, a simple piece of colored cloth, evoke such a profound sense of belonging? It’s a current that runs through a people, an inherited story that gives individual lives a collective meaning, making a solitary person feel like a small but vital part of a grand, ongoing narrative that started long before they were born and will continue long after they are gone.
