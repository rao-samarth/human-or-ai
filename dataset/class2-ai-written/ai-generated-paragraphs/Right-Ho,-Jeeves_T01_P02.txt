There’s always one, isn’t there? Perched on a flimsy crate by the subway entrance, armed with a megaphone and a profound misunderstanding of basically everything. He’s here to save us all, apparently. From what, exactly, remains a mystery, buried under a torrent of buzzwords he likely found on a blog five minutes ago. The commuters just flow around him, a river of tired suits and headphones, treating him like another piece of inconveniently placed street furniture. He screams about corporate greed to people rushing to their corporate jobs and demands community action from a crowd of strangers who can't even make eye contact. You have to admire the sheer, unadulterated confidence it takes to believe your unsolicited shouting is the one thing this whole city was missing. It’s a spectacular form of generosity, really, bestowing his wisdom upon those of us just trying to catch the 5:15 train without getting elbowed in the ribs. What a hero.
