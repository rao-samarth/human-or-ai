I glanced around. My "family unit" consisted of me, myself, and the single-serving yogurt in my basket. "I am the family unit," I explained, gesturing to my solitary existence. She narrowed her eyes, unconvinced. "Are you the designated head of household?" she pressed, as if I were applying for a mortgage instead of a toothpick-speared piece of processed meat.

"Yes," I sighed, defeated. "I am the head, the body, and the feet of this household." She finally, grudgingly, handed one over.
