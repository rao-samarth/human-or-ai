Oh, everyone here just loves a good feud. It’s the town’s primary form of entertainment, better than Friday night football. They whisper about getting even, plotting meticulous little acts of social sabotage over lukewarm coffee at the diner. And when someone finally pulls it off—ruins a reputation, gets someone fired, whatever—there's a brief, glorious moment of triumph. The victor gets to puff out their chest for a week. But then what? The gossip moves on to the next scandal, and they’re just the person who holds a grudge. Meanwhile, the one they supposedly destroyed is seen planting new flowers or laughing with their kids. How utterly pathetic. They just let it go. It’s almost infuriating, this quiet refusal to play the game. They get to sleep at night, while the winner is left polishing a trophy nobody else remembers. Honestly, it’s a terrible return on investment.
