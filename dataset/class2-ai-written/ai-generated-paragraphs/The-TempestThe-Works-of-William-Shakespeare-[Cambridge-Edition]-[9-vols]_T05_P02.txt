You keep talking about getting back to the 'real world,' as if these buildings just sprouted from the ground by themselves. This is real, too. Every single bit of it. We built this. We carved out a space, paved over the mud, and put up lights to keep the dark out. You see it as a cage, but I see it as a shelter. It's predictable and it's safe here. Out there, in your perfect wilderness, everything is either trying to eat you or just grow right over you until you're gone. You call that freedom? I call it a constant, pointless struggle. We fought for every inch of this concrete and steel, and you want to just throw it all away and go back to hiding in the dirt?
