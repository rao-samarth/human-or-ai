The press of bodies in the plaza was a familiar discomfort, a constant tide against which I had to push. Above us, the Chancellor’s face smiled from a hundred screens, the electric hum a backdrop to the city’s weary shuffle. My own pulse throbbed in my ears, a frantic counter-rhythm. The small, dense weight in my pocket felt like an anchor, pulling me down toward a future I hadn't chosen. Up ahead, the checkpoint shimmered in the afternoon haze, a line of grey-uniformed Wardens methodically scanning faces. What difference could this one act make against such an immense, unblinking machine? The people around me were an ocean of averted gazes, each person locked in their own private struggle to simply survive until tomorrow. Turning back was easy; I could melt into the crowd and be gone in seconds. The choice was simple, and impossible: blend back into the river of humanity, or walk straight toward the uniforms and see what happened next.
