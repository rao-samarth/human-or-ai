Amid the low hum of the station and the crackle of an announcer's voice, I caught a fragment of conversation from the bench behind me. An older woman was speaking, her tone a low, amused rasp. "We just decide to believe it, that's all," she said to her younger companion. "He puts on the stiff collar and becomes the expert. She carries the leather briefcase and becomes the executive. It's just clothing and a convincing tone of voice." A short, dry laugh followed. "No one's really an adult, dear. We're just children who've gotten very, very good at playing house, and we’ve convinced everyone else to play along." I watched a uniformed conductor stride past, his posture perfect and his expression unreadable, a character moving confidently across a stage I'd never noticed before.
