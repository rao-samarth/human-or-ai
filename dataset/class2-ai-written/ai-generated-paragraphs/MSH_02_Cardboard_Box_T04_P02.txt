You were right to stay away from the reunion. It started so normally, with the smell of charcoal and the sound of the kids chasing the dog on the lawn. But then, of course, he and David began talking about their father's workshop. For them, it was never just a discussion; it was a crusade, this obsessive need to prove who had honored his memory best. The love in his voice curdled as he spoke, his face getting blotchy and red. It was a devotion so fierce it looked like pure hatred. When David made that cheap comment about the inheritance, it was over. He picked up the heavy lemonade pitcher, the condensation still beading on it, and he didn't even shout. He just swung. The crash of glass was almost lost in the sudden silence before the screaming started, a sound I can’t get out of my head. All that furious, protective love, and it ended right there, glittering among the ice cubes on the patio stones.
