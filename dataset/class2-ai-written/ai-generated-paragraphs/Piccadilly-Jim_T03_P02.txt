I remember how I used to move through these streets, just another body in the flow, a ghost in the machine. The city was just noise and concrete, a maze I drifted through because stopping felt worse. I was pretty hollowed out back then. And then there was you. You didn't try to fix me or fill the empty spaces with grand promises. You just saw me, and you’d point out things I’d never noticed—the splash of graffiti that looked like a bird, or the way the setting sun turned the glass towers to honey. Slowly, I started seeing it too. The old noise began to sound a bit like music. I’m still walking the same packed sidewalks under the same skyscrapers, but I’m finally here. I'm not just passing through anymore.
