I understand why you're upset. Every part of this past month, the strange excuses, the missed calls—it was all a fabrication. But please, you have to see that it wasn't a cage I was building around you; it was a launchpad. Sometimes, to give someone the gift of a genuine fresh start, you have to hide the wrapping paper. I needed you to believe things were ordinary, even difficult, so that this one moment could be extraordinary. It was the only way. This wasn't about betraying your trust in the past. It was about investing in our future, creating a foundation so strong that it needed this initial, secret scaffolding to set properly. The lies are over now. What’s left is the truth of what we can build from here, and I promise, it’s a much better story.
