I was just trying to mind my own business at the airport bar, nursing a flat ginger ale, but the man in the corner was making it difficult. He was leaning so far forward he was practically climbing into the muted television, whispering frantic encouragements at our nation's bobsled team. “Come on, you glorious lunatics, hold that line,” he muttered. A moment later, a woman in a crisp blazer, who'd been typing furiously on her laptop nearby, slammed it shut. “They’re coming in too hot!” she announced to no one in particular. The man’s head whipped around, a grin of pure recognition spreading across his face. For the final thirty seconds of the run, these two absolute strangers became a unified coaching staff, shouting tactical advice and groaning in unison until the sled crossed the finish line. I’ve never seen two people bond so quickly over anything, let alone strategically sliding down an ice chute.
