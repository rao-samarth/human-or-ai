The man with the kind eyes is still smiling, holding the car door open for me. The street behind him is already dark, and my hostel is miles away on foot. He offered the ride so easily, laughing about the unreliable bus schedule we both just missed, and everything about his gentle manner seems genuine. There’s even a child’s crayon drawing of a sun taped to his dashboard. But the guidebook, my parents, the pre-trip security briefings—they all screamed the same warnings in a deafening chorus. He’s probably just a decent person trying to help a stranded tourist. But what if he isn’t? What if this warmth is just practice, a carefully constructed trap that looks so much like kindness? Standing here under the buzzing streetlight, I realize the choice isn't between a ride and a long walk. It’s between trusting a stranger’s humanity and trusting the statistics that say I shouldn’t.
