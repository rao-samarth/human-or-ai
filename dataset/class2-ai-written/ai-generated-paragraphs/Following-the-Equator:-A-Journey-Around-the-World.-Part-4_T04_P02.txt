Everyone adores this place, praising the quaint storefronts and the obsessive precision of the lawn care. It’s all so wonderfully *civil*. You should see a town council meeting; they’ll debate the budget for the hanging petunia baskets with the solemnity of negotiating a nuclear treaty. We’re all about “community” here, you see. It’s a very specific kind of community, though—the kind where a misplaced recycling bin can fuel a week of vicious neighborhood gossip, and a smile is just the polite prelude to a character assassination conducted over lukewarm coffee. They’ll compliment your new car while mentally filing it away as evidence you’re living irresponsibly. This isn’t a town; it’s a beautifully landscaped arena where the spectators are also the gladiators, just waiting for someone to falter.
