The fluorescent hum of the terminal barely cut through the chaos of departures. Ahead of me, a hurried man fumbled with his ticket, and a thick envelope slipped unseen from his jacket, landing beside a bin overflowing with discarded coffee cups. No one noticed. I saw the corner of it sticking out, and a quick glance confirmed my own wallet was perilously thin. The temptation was immediate, a cold, practical voice suggesting how simple it would be. Just keep walking. But the thought soured the air, a familiar and unwelcome tightening in my gut. It was a line I had drawn for myself long ago, a boundary that defined more than just a single action. Shoving through the throng of passengers, I shouted after him, finally catching his eye just as the bus doors hissed shut. He took the envelope with a startled thanks, but I was already turning away, the gnawing hunger a small price for walking on the right side of that line.
