From the window, the evening traffic blurred into long streaks of red and white, each one a life I would never know. For years, I had carried the memory of the wrong done to me like a sharp-edged stone in my pocket. My hand would instinctively find it, tracing its harsh edges, reopening the ache just to confirm it was still there. It was a bitter, familiar weight. But the stone only grew heavier, pulling me down while the city rushed on around me, utterly indifferent to my private ghost. Tonight, watching the endless, anonymous flow, I realized I could simply open my hand. I could just let it fall. It wouldn't make a sound against the roar of a million other heartbreaks, but my own silence, finally, would be mine again.
