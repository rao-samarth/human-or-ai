It’s funny, the things you notice when the house is totally silent and you’re the only one awake. I was just flipping through some old history book I have, looking at these faded pictures of people who made colossal, world-changing blunders. You read about their arrogance, their refusal to see the obvious truth right in front of them, and it’s so easy to judge. You think, how could they possibly have been so blind? But then I put the book down and pick up my phone, and I see it all happening again, just with better graphics. The same shouting matches, the same overconfidence, the same stubborn marches toward predictable disasters. We get a front-row seat to the rerun and somehow still manage to convince ourselves it’s a brand-new show.
