Uncle Mark fires another volley across the dinner table, his point punctuated by a rogue green bean flying from his fork. Why waste time on maps with sea monsters when you could see the real Colosseum? He’s laughing, and the whole family joins in. I want to scream that he’s missing the entire point. The Colosseum is a ruin; it’s a known quantity with a gift shop at the exit. But a place called the Whispering Peaks or the Sunken City? That’s pure potential. He doesn’t understand. The thrill isn't in seeing something that was, but in imagining something that *could be*, a place where the borders aren't defined by treaties but by the reach of a dragon's shadow. A world humming with possibility, not history. He just grunts, scoops up more mashed potatoes, and changes the subject to the leaky faucet in his guest bathroom.
