It's always amusing, watching someone meticulously plan their grand payback. They sit there in the dark, just like this, convincing themselves they're crafting some righteous masterpiece of justice. Every detail is perfect, every potential outcome mapped out. They become a meticulous little architect of misery, all while the person who wronged them is probably sleeping soundly, or worse, not thinking of them at all. The real joke is that the planner is the one truly trapped. They build this elaborate cage for someone else, decorating it with their own pain and anger, and then voluntarily lock themselves inside. They whisper about "closure" and "making things right," but all they’re really doing is poisoning their own well, one drop of bitterness at a time, until there's nothing left to drink. They think they're forging a weapon, but they're just sharpening the knife they'll eventually fall on. It’s a beautiful, self-defeating art form, really.
