It all started with Mrs. Gable, I think, just an offhand remark she made to the mailman about hearing noises from the old abandoned mill. Nothing more than that. But this is our town, and a stray comment like that has a way of finding fertile ground. By lunchtime, the story had grown legs. The mailman told the baker, who swore he’d seen strange lights himself, and by the afternoon bake sale, the mill wasn’t just creaky and old—it was actively haunted. That simple word, ‘haunted,’ changed everything. Suddenly, it wasn't a piece of history; it was a threat. Kids were daring each other to touch the fence, and I even heard the council was scheduling a meeting to discuss ‘safety concerns.’ It’s wild how one little story, one whispered word, can rewrite the map of your own hometown right before your eyes.
