I sat here ready to give you every excuse. I wanted to tell you that the system was broken, that the deadlines were impossible, that the pressure was the real reason the whole thing fell apart. My throat was closing up, and just as the defensive anger began to crest, the noise in my head simply stopped. It was suddenly so quiet, and in that silence, I could finally see the entire chain of events clearly. It wasn’t some grand conspiracy or a deep personal failing; it was just a single, overlooked assumption I made back in the first week, a tiny miscalculation that cascaded outward. All that righteous fury, that feeling of being wronged, just deflated. It left behind a simple, cold fact that I couldn't argue with anymore. The mistake was mine, and I know exactly where I made it.
