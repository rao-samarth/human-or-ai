You keep saying it's just a job, a paycheck. But it's not. It's their name on the letterhead, the same name my father used to curse under his breath every night at the dinner table after they shut the plant down. I can still see his hands, stained and calloused, shaking as he read the final notice. He built his life in that place. You’re asking me to walk into that same building, shake their hands, and pretend none of that history exists between us? To just smile and thank them for an opportunity that feels like it’s built on the wreckage of his career? It’s more than just my future on the line here; it feels like a betrayal of his, a quiet statement that everything he went through didn't really matter in the end.
