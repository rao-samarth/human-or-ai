You have to admire the sheer, unstoppable restlessness of it all. It must have started with one person, ages ago, who just couldn't handle the crushing boredom of their own village and decided to see what was over the next hill. A few thousand years of that same itch, and here we are, rattling along in a climate-controlled tube, watching the world blur into a smear of indistinct green. This entire grand enterprise of human movement, this network of tracks and schedules and overpriced snacks, all exists so we can efficiently transport our boredom to a new postal code. They invented the wheel, then the engine, and eventually the tiny, bafflingly expensive bottle of water, all in service of a fundamental inability to just sit still. What a legacy.
