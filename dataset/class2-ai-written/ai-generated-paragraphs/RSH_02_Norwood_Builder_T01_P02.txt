I know we don’t talk much, but I felt I had to reach out. I saw them near your workstation late last night, long after everyone else had gone home. They were quick, almost furtive, and I thought nothing of it until the quarterly reports were flagged this morning for data manipulation. Now, suddenly, everyone is looking for who had access, and their name is conspicuously absent from the conversation while yours is at the top of every list. It’s too neat, too perfect. They’ve been building this narrative for weeks, dropping little comments in meetings and emails that all subtly point away from them and towards your inexperience. It’s a carefully constructed illusion, and every digital breadcrumb looks like it was left by you. They’re not just letting you take the fall; they are actively pushing you. Please, be careful and start documenting everything you can.
