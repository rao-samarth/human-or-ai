My brother-in-law, Mark, almost dropped the entire tray of burgers, but my niece, who never helps, happened to be walking past and caught it with one hand. A moment later, Uncle David and my father were getting heated about the new bypass, their voices rising, until the sprinkler system suddenly sputtered on, dousing them both. People call these things coincidences, little bits of random luck that make for a good story later. But I see the subtle adjustments, the unseen hand that nudges events just so. It’s in the way a forgotten photograph falls from a book, sparking a memory that mends a quiet rift between two cousins. Every near-miss and happy accident here feels like a correction, a gentle steering back toward a path that was always meant to be.
