Everyone in town knew to give "Grizzly" Mike a wide berth. He was a mountain of a man who rode a motorcycle that sounded like a dragon clearing its throat, and his leather jacket had more patches than a scout's sash. His scowl was legendary; it was rumored to have once curdled milk at the dairy stand from fifty paces. People would cross the street, clutching their purses and their small children, whenever his bike rumbled into view. So, the scene at the annual Founder's Day bake sale caused something of a town-wide short circuit. There, behind the Pet Rescue table, was Grizzly Mike himself, carefully fitting a tiny, hand-knitted pink sweater onto a trembling chihuahua. He leaned in close, his gravelly voice a low whisper, "Does this bring out your eyes, my little sweet pea?" A few jaws hung open, but the spell was only broken when old Mrs. Gable dropped her prize-winning lemon meringue pie with a soft splat.
