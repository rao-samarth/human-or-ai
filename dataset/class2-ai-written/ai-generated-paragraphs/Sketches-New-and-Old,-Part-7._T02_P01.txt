The keynote speaker was droning on about synergy, but all I could focus on was the single, renegade eyelash that had decided to stage a hostile takeover of my left eye. It felt like a tiny, sharp spear, jabbing at my cornea with every single blink. I tried to look engaged, nodding at what I hoped were appropriate intervals while my eye began to water. It threatened to send a single, dramatic tear down my cheek, which would no doubt be misinterpreted as a deep emotional connection to quarterly growth projections. I subtly tried to pull at the corner of my eyelid, hoping to dislodge the tiny tyrant, but it was no use. It was just me, my increasingly red eye, and the speaker’s profound appreciation for buzzwords, all trapped together in a feedback loop of polite agony. All I wanted was to escape to the restroom and splash my face with water, but I was pinned at the table, a smiling hostage to both etiquette and my own anatomy.
