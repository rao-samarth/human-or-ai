Familiarity in a small town can be a kind of blindness. We see the same faces walk the same sidewalks and believe we understand the people behind them: the grocer with his worn apron, the librarian whose world seems contained by Dewey decimals, the quiet woman who tends her garden. We build these neat, manageable identities for others based on their functions and habits. Yet, what are these but costumes for the part they play in the town's daily life? The core of a person is not the job they perform or the path they walk each morning. It is the unseen current of their thoughts, the private histories they carry in silence, the quiet ambitions that have nothing to do with their public role. That is the true self. Everything else is just the shape they take to move through the world.
