The Grand Hall was supposed to feel unified tonight, a celebration of the year’s end. But the four long tables, each draped in its own proud color, felt like separate, warring islands. Conversation was a low, cautious murmur, rarely bridging the chasms between them. The clatter of a dropped fork from the Blue table was enough to draw a dozen sharp, silent glances from the Reds. I saw a girl I used to walk home with, her face a pale mask under the golden banners of her house. We didn't acknowledge each other. It felt less like a competition now and more like a permanent, quiet schism, a division we had all inherited and were now too weary to fight. We were all dressed in our finest, but the air was thick with the dust of old grudges, a silent understanding that the lines drawn in chalk on the sports field had long since hardened into walls.
