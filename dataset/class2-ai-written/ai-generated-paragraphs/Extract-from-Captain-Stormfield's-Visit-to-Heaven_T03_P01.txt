They’ll remember me for the public works, the grand, hollow structures that won the acclaim. I see my name on plaques and hear it in speeches, a name attached to things that were compromises from the start, built for budgets and headlines. But in the quiet of this house, under the solitary glow of this lamp, none of that matters. My hands trace the lines of a different creation, one nobody ever saw, a thing I built for no reason other than to see if it could be done right. It has no plaque. It earned no prize. It simply *is*, flawless and complete in a way those celebrated projects never were. The world can have the name and the gleaming facades; I know what I truly built, and it will sit here in the dark, long after the rest has been forgotten.
