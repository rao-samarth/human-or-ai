I’d been tracking their orbit all evening, a comical series of near-misses involving a rogue champagne cork and an aggressively chatty donor who cornered me by the canapés. But now, the path was clear. They were standing alone by the towering floral centerpiece, looking almost as overwhelmed by the sheer volume of lilies as I was. This was it. I straightened my tie, took a fortifying sip of what I hoped was sparkling water, and began my strategic advance across the polished floor. Halfway there, they leaned in close to one of the giant white flowers, inspecting it with the intense focus of a bomb disposal expert. They didn't even see me approach. For a moment, I paused, watching them gently poke a petal. Instead of feeling defeated by this latest, strangest obstacle, a smile spread across my face. Maybe asking about the structural integrity of a lily was a better opening line than anything I’d planned anyway.
