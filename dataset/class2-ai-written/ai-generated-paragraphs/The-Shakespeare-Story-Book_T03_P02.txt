On Sunday mornings, the town of Oakhaven presented its best self, and no one embodied this better than the couple strolling past the gazebo. He, with his easy smile and hand resting lightly on the small of her back; she, with a laugh that seemed to catch the morning light. Neighbors waved, remarking on how lovely they looked, a perfect addition to the town's collection of white picket fences and blooming rose bushes. But beneath the warm fabric of his sweater, his fingers pressed just a little too hard, a silent reminder of the morning's bitter words. Her smile, so radiant to onlookers, never quite reached her eyes, which were already calculating the quietest way to pack a suitcase. They were a beautiful portrait for a town that appreciated fine things, a carefully composed image whose cracks were only visible to the two people trapped inside it.
