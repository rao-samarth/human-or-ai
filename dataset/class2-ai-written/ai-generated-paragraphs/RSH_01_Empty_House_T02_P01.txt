Of course, he’s here again. I move out to the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nothing but grass and the occasional bored-looking cow, specifically for some peace. And what do I get? Him, on my porch, drinking my coffee as if he pays the mortgage. For twenty years it’s been the same story. I get a flat tire in a storm; he appears with a jack and an umbrella, complaining about the rain. I get fired; he shows up with cheap beer and a terrible movie, monopolizing my couch. It’s like a chronic condition, this friendship. You think you've finally shaken it, found some quiet solitude, but then you hear that familiar, obnoxious laugh and realize you're stuck with this person for life. He's probably already planning my eulogy, just to get the last word in.
