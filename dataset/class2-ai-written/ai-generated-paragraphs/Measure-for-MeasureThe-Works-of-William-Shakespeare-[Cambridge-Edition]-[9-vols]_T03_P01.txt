You keep saying I crossed a line, but where is this universal line everyone is supposed to see? You draw it here, and I’ll point to ten others who draw it somewhere else entirely, each one convinced their own version is absolute. We all build these little rulebooks for ourselves, pretending they’re some sacred text when really, they’re just guides to our own survival. You see a moral failure; I see a difficult choice made to protect what we have. Is your judgment really so pure? Or is it just a way to feel clean, to put yourself on higher ground without getting your hands dirty? It's easy to talk about principles from a distance. It's a lot harder when you're the one who has to make the decision that actually costs something.
