The old man in the corner booth, smelling faintly of damp wool and cheap coffee, held the small audience captive. His voice was a low, gravelly thing, but it carried over the clatter of cutlery. He was explaining, with a perfectly straight face, how his great-uncle had once taught a flock of pigeons to play poker. Not well, he admitted with a confessional wave of his hand, but they had the bluffing down pat. A young woman at the counter, polishing a glass, paused her work. She knew it was nonsense, every word a carefully constructed lie built on a foundation of pure air, yet she found herself leaning in. The real magic wasn't in the card-playing birds; it was in the telling. It was in the unwavering glint in the old man's eye, the way he could spin a ridiculous fiction into something so compelling that for a fleeting moment, you wanted it to be the gospel truth. The lie was the art, and the belief, however brief, was the applause.
