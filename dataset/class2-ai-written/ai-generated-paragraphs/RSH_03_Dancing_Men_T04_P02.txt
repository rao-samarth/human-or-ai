I knew something was off with how David handled the new intern. At first, it just seemed like he was being a really dedicated mentor, you know? He'd block off his calendar for hours just to 'train' her, bringing her coffee every morning. But then it got possessive. He’d shoot down any project ideas she had unless they came through him first, and he’d get visibly irritated if anyone else on the team even offered her help. The one time she went to lunch with our group, he was cold to her for a week. We all saw it happening. He kept saying he was just protecting her from office politics, trying to build her up, but he was really just building a cage around her. It ended badly, of course. She eventually went to HR, and he was escorted out last Tuesday. All that potential, his and hers, just completely wasted.
