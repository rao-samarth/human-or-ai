You have to understand, from that office window, you could see everything. The entire city spread out below, a web of lights and hurried lives, and none of it was mine. He always said we were a team, building something together from the ground up. And we were, for a while. But I saw the life he was living, the car service waiting downstairs, the reservations he never had to make. It wasn't about him, not really. It was about the fact that there was only one seat at the very top, and he was already in it. I just wanted the view. I wanted to look down at the river of yellow cabs and know that I had finally arrived, that I wasn't just another person packed onto the morning train. Someone always has to lose for someone else to win. That’s just how the city works.
