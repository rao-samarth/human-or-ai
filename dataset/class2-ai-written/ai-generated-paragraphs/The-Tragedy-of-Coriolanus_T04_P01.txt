Out here, you can hear a single bird from a mile away. It’s hard to reconcile that with the sound we made that afternoon. It didn't start with anger, you have to understand that. It started with a feeling of rightness, a conviction that bound us together until we were one big, breathing thing. A current pulled us along. I don't remember deciding to move, we just did, a single body with a hundred heads all turned the same way. My voice wasn't my own; it was just one more piece of the roar that drowned out everything, especially our own thoughts. Then, just as quickly, it was over. We weren't a 'we' anymore, just a collection of strangers blinking in the sudden quiet, each of us alone with what our hands had done.
