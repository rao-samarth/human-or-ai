I saw them today, at the park cleanup. A woman in sleek, expensive leggings pulled weeds next to a man whose calloused hands and worn-out boots told a different story entirely. For a while, the silence between them felt heavy, a wall built from unspoken assumptions about each other's lives, the kind of quiet that feels louder than noise. You could almost feel the tension of two separate worlds colliding over a patch of stubborn dandelions. But then the man offered her his water bottle without a word, and she accepted with a grateful nod. Later, they were laughing together, pointing at a stubborn root they’d finally unearthed. It was a small moment, easily missed in the bustle of the day. Yet, it felt like proof that the fences we build between ourselves aren't nearly as solid as we think; with a little shared effort, even just pulling weeds, they can start to come down.
