It’s strange when you think about it, not in a frightening way, just in a purely mechanical one. We treat our existence like an ongoing project, something to be improved and extended indefinitely, but it’s not. It’s a closed system. Every biological process, every cellular division, is a step along a predetermined arc. There isn’t a version of the story where the line just keeps going up and to the right forever. It’s more like a broadcast with a scheduled sign-off time, known from the very beginning. We spend all our energy on the content of the programming, which is important, but we forget that the static at the end isn't a technical fault. It’s the final, scheduled part of the transmission.
