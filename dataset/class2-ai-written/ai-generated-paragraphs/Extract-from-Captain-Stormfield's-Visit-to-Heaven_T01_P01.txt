Standing here on this corner, watching all these people rush past, it’s hard to reconcile the world I see with the stories I was told. Each face is a universe of private worries and fleeting joys. A siren wails a few blocks away; someone’s worst moment is happening right now. Yet, we’re taught that the architect of all this chaos is primarily concerned with our specific rituals, our whispered praise, the precise wording of our requests. It feels like a profound mismatch of scale. Does a being who spins galaxies truly care if we kneel on the correct day, or eat a certain food? It seems so small, so human, to imagine a cosmic force that demands such personal, specific flattery while the immense, impersonal machinery of life and death grinds on around us. The sheer noise of this street, the desperation and the hope all mixed together, feels far too complex for such a simple, tidy explanation.
