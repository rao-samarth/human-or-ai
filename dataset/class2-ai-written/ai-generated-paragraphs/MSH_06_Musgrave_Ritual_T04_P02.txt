I know what you see when you look at me, especially on a journey like this one, surrounded by people with places to be. You see the worn hands and the simple coat and you draw your conclusions. But you have to understand, my mind doesn’t stop working just because my job requires no thought. I watch the flow of passengers, the timetables, the subtle shifts in cargo weight, and I see the entire system. I can predict the bottleneck two stations ahead just by the frantic energy of the conductor. I understand the complex dance of it all, the fragile dependencies that the men in charge only see on a spreadsheet. This insight, however, is a language no one here expects me to speak. It’s a tool I have no permission to use. So I keep quiet, a silent observer holding a perfect, useless blueprint to a machine I’m only allowed to polish.
