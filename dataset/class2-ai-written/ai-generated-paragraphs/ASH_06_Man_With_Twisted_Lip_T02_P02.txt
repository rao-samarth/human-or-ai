I can feel their eyes on me, even through the glass of the general store. It’s a new kind of look, one I haven’t seen since I was a kid who broke a window. But this is different; it's colder. They think I betrayed something, some unspoken agreement about how things are meant to be around here. Let them think it. Their quiet approval never fixed the draft in my son's bedroom or guaranteed a future for him that wasn't tied to this town's slow decline. They whisper about heritage, about what my grandfather would say. My grandfather spent his life worried sick about money. I won't. I see the cars slow down as they pass my house, the curtains twitching in the windows across the street. The silence at the diner is heavy, but the silence in my bank account is finally gone. I’ll learn to live with the former.
