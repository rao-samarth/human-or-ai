They put the new tower up on Miller’s Ridge, and everyone talks about the perfect signal, as if that’s a fair trade. It’s a skeletal, blinking thing, a permanent thorn against the sunset where the old lightning-split oak used to be. We used to know the weather was turning by the way the wind bent the long grass in the low field; my grandfather taught me that. Now, a little icon on a glowing screen tells you, I suppose. It’s more accurate, they claim. The children don’t look up anymore. Their necks are perpetually bent towards some invisible world in their hands, and the low hum from the tower’s base seems to be the only hymn they know. They call it connection, but I've never seen the neighbors look so far apart.
