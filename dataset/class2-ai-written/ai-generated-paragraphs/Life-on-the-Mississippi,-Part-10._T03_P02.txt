It’s nearly two in the morning, and the house is completely silent except for the hum of the refrigerator. I’m just staring at my screen, thinking about the call I made three hours ago. The project was completely off the rails, a mess of bad data and worse assumptions, and I was stuck. I sent one short text into our group chat, and within five minutes, my phone rang. It was Alex, halfway across the world, walking me through a fix he’d figured out years ago on a similar problem. People talk about networking, but this isn't that. This is something else entirely. It’s a lifeline to a handful of people who went through the same fire I did, who speak the same shorthand, and who will always pick up the phone. It's the quiet confidence that no matter how bad things get, you’re never truly working alone.
