So that’s it? You wave a piece of paper from a judge and we’re all supposed to forget? His voice was low, barely cutting through the hum of the diner's neon sign behind them. That single sheet is supposed to erase what everyone in this town saw, what everyone knows? The other man, shoulders hunched against the evening chill, didn't flinch. “The system worked. They listened to the facts, not gossip.” “Facts?” A bitter laugh escaped the first man. “They heard a sanitized story in a sterile room a hundred miles from here. They didn't see the aftermath. They don't have to live with the empty spaces you left. Your ‘not guilty’ doesn't mean you're innocent. It just means a dozen strangers couldn't agree you were guilty enough. There's a difference, and we all have to live with it.”
