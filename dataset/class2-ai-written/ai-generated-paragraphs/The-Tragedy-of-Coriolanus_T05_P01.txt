Even from across the ballroom, amidst the polite clinking of crystal and the warm glow of the chandeliers, I could feel her influence like a change in the air pressure. My new husband squeezed my hand, oblivious, but my focus was locked on her. She stood with a small circle of guests, her smile a perfect, practiced curve, her gestures graceful and deliberate. I knew that performance. I knew exactly what she was saying without hearing a word. She was spinning the story of my accomplishments into a chronicle of her own maternal martyrdom, my hard-won success becoming a mere footnote to her epic of sacrifice. Each compliment I had received tonight had been expertly intercepted, absorbed by her gravitational field until I felt less like the guest of honor and more like a carefully constructed prop in her lifelong one-woman show. A cold knot tightened in my stomach; this was supposed to be my moment, but I was just a character in a story she had written long ago.
