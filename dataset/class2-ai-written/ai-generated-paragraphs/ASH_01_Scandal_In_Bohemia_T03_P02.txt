The man in the corner office always wore his success like a well-tailored suit. His laugh was loud and frequent, echoing down the hallways, and his handshake felt like a promise of stability. He was the one people looked to, the unshakeable pillar of the department. But I saw him once, very late, when the building was hollowed out and silent. He was just sitting at his large desk, staring at a blank screen, the confident posture gone. His shoulders were slumped, and the practiced smile had been put away for the night, revealing a deep, quiet exhaustion that seemed to seep into the very grain of the wood. It made me wonder about the cost of maintaining such a bright, unblemished surface, and how many of us were just tired actors playing a part for an audience that was also just acting. We were all just holding our breath, waiting for the curtain to fall.
