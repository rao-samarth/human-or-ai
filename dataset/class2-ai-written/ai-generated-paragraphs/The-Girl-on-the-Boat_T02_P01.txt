So, you’re not going to believe what happened with the other Sarah in accounting. Apparently, the new temp in the mailroom thought I was her, and for an entire morning, I was receiving the most bizarrely sensitive financial documents instead of my usual marketing briefs. It started with a single, ominous-looking interoffice envelope and escalated quickly. Before I knew it, people from finance were stopping by my desk, whispering about quarterly discrepancies and offshore asset management, expecting me to have answers. I just kept smiling, nodding, and saying things like "I'll look into the vertical integrations immediately." The charade only ended when the real Sarah stormed over, demanding to know why she’d been sent three boxes of promotional keychains and a memo about our new social media mascot, a squirrel named Nutmeg. I think I might have accidentally approved a seven-figure wire transfer.
