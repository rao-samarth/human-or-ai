The grand hall buzzed with the practiced warmth of people performing importance, a symphony of clinking glasses and calculated laughter. We stood near the towering windows, watching the city lights blur into a cold, indifferent gleam. In this room, every word felt like a currency being exchanged for status, every smile a negotiation. Yet, between us, a profound silence held its own space, a pocket of reality in the overwhelming artifice. We didn't need to speak. A brief, shared glance was enough to acknowledge the absurdity of it all, a silent confirmation that we were seeing the same hollow spectacle. It is a strange and anchoring thing, to find a person with whom you can be truly quiet, creating a sanctuary not of place, but of mutual understanding. In the crushing weight of manufactured meaning, our shared silence was the only genuine article.
