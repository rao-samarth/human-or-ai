That woman at the next table, stirring her latte, just said “the system works.” It’s so easy for them to say. They see a headline, a verdict read out on the news, and they tick a box in their minds. Case closed. But they don't see the nights you spend staring at the ceiling, replaying every single moment. The courts give you a piece of paper, a sterile judgment that’s supposed to balance some cosmic scale. It doesn't. It doesn’t give you back your peace, and it certainly doesn't make the person who hurt you understand the wreckage they left behind. All it does is put a neat little bow on the trauma and file it away. I sometimes think the only thing that could ever feel real, the only true settlement, wouldn’t come from a judge. It would have to come from me.
