You know, I was just thinking about that fellow who used to live down the hall, the one always chasing some shortcut. He became utterly convinced that the original owner of our building had hidden gold inside the lobby’s plaster columns. But instead of just making a small, exploratory hole, he concocted this unbelievably complex plan involving after-hours access codes he bought online and a custom-built, silent drill bit shipped from Germany. For weeks, he meticulously mapped out the building's wiring and security camera sight-lines, creating charts that looked like a military invasion plan. He even started practicing a fake limp to explain why he was using a cane, which he intended to use to smuggle out the plaster dust. Of course, the first time he tried the drill, he hit a water pipe, flooding the mailroom and exposing everything. All that genius for a fantasy.
