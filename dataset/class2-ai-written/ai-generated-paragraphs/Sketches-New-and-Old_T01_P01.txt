The man in the crowded piazza was making a single foam ball vanish. It was a clumsy, obvious trick, the kind a child would figure out in seconds, yet dozens of people stood mesmerized, their focus absolute. That's when I saw him—a teenager moving with a chilling grace along the perimeter. He wasn’t watching the performance; he was studying the distracted faces, the dangling purses, the bulging pockets. A wallet slid from a backpack into his hand as easily as a letter into an envelope, and no one saw. A shout formed in my throat, a warning, an accusation. But I swallowed it. Would they even turn around, or would they just be annoyed that I had broken the spell of their cheap entertainment? The boy disappeared into the flow of the city, and a moment later, the crowd erupted in applause for the magician holding up his empty hands.
