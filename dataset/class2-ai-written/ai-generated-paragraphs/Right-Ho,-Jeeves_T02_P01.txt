You know, it’s funny sitting here in the quiet, thinking about all the noise they made. They were so sure of themselves, weren’t they? All that shouting and table-pounding, convinced their sheer volume would make them right. I watched them build their entire argument on sand, on feelings and what they *wished* was true. And all the while, we just sat back, laid out the facts one by one, and waited. We didn't need to yell. The logic did the work for us. In the end, their structure just collapsed under its own weight, and there was nothing left but a confused silence. It's not a gloating kind of victory, but there's a deep satisfaction in knowing that a carefully constructed thought can withstand any storm of nonsense they can throw at it.
