Everyone in town knew Mr. Abernathy only by the scowl he wore while stocking shelves at the general store. He was a creature of sharp angles and silence, his movements economical and his gaze perpetually fixed on some distant, dissatisfying point beyond the dusty windows. People gave him a wide berth, whispering that a man so closed off must be nursing some deep-seated bitterness. Then one evening, as the rain turned the main street into a slick, grey mirror, I saw him. He was kneeling on the wet pavement, patiently coaxing a stray, shivering dog out from under a parked car with a piece of his own sandwich. He didn't look up, didn't seem to care if anyone saw his quiet act of kindness. In that small, unassuming moment, the hard lines of his public face seemed to dissolve, revealing a landscape of hidden sorrow and gentleness that no one had ever bothered to look for.
