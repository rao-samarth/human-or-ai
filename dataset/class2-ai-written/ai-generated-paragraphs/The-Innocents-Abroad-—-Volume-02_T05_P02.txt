So let me get this straight. You want us to pay a small fortune to wear matching lanyards and follow a man holding a bright yellow umbrella? We’d be herded onto an air-conditioned bus at dawn, shuttled to a "charming local village" where some poor guy is contractually obligated to pretend he enjoys carving the same wooden bird for the eightieth time that week, all for our "authentic" viewing pleasure. Then we'll be ushered to a pre-approved restaurant to eat the "regional specialty" that tastes suspiciously like something microwaved, before being given exactly forty-five minutes to buy a factory-made souvenir. It’s not an adventure; it’s a meticulously scheduled performance. I'd rather just stay home and watch a documentary. At least then the people on screen aren't actively hiding their soul-crushing boredom for my benefit.
