The whistle came first, a high, thin shriek that cut through the dark. We never heard that sound in the songs they played on the radio. Then the house bucked. Not a noble shudder, just a violent, teeth-rattling slam that threw dishes from the shelves. I grabbed my sister’s arm and yanked her down, our heads cracking against the wooden floor beneath the kitchen table. Plaster dust rained down, ghost-white in the strobing orange light from the window. The world shrank to the smell of cordite and the tremor in the floorboards. Another blast, closer now, and the patriotic portraits on the wall rattled in their frames, their painted smiles suddenly looking like grotesque, ignorant lies. There was no honor in this, no grand purpose, only the frantic, animal need to breathe through the choking dust until the next shriek began.
