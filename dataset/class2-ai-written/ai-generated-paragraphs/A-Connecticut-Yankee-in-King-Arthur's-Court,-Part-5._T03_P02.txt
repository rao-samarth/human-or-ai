I passed the old cathedral again today, its spires clawing at the smoggy sky while the traffic below choked the street with noise and fumes. It’s hard not to notice the sheer amount of money locked up in that stone and glass, in the gilded crosses and the intricate carvings that no one at ground level can even see properly. A few blocks away, people line up for a bowl of soup from a charity van. It feels like a profound, cosmic joke. I wonder at what point the core message got lost. When did the simple, radical teachings of humility and charity get traded for opulent real estate and a rigid hierarchy more concerned with its own preservation than with the suffering it was meant to alleviate? It’s become a fortress of wealth, a silent, echoing museum to a faith that seems to have fled the premises long ago, leaving only the cold, ornate shell behind.
