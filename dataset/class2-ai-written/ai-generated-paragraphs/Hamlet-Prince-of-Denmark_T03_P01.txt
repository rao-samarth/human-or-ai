The man across the platform is having a very serious, one-sided conversation with the departure board. His hands slice the air, carving out points that only he can see. My first thought, the charitable one, was that he had a hidden earpiece, a business call gone wrong. But I’ve been watching for ten minutes, and his phone remains dark in his pocket. He isn’t angry, not exactly. He seems to be pleading with the flickering letters, a desperate negotiation with the 10:42 to the coast. A part of me, the civic-minded part, insists I should find a transit officer. Just to be safe. Yet another, louder part asks what I would even say. That a man is acting strangely? In a city of millions, that’s just Tuesday. To interfere would be an act of supreme arrogance, branding his private reality as a public problem. He might just be lonely. Now my own heart is thumping a frantic rhythm as I watch him, and I wonder who is truly disturbed: the man lost in his world, or me, the one obsessively trying to make sense of it. The train is pulling in.
