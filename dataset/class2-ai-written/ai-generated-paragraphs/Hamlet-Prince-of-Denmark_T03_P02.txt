In the middle of the crowded plaza, a man was meticulously teaching a flock of pigeons how to waltz. He wasn't shouting or making a scene; he was humming a Strauss tune and gently nudging the birds with his loafers, demonstrating the box step with surprising grace. I stopped, sandwich halfway to my mouth, waiting for someone else to notice. But the river of humanity flowed on, people checking their phones, sidestepping the man and his avian dance class as if he were just another statue. He gave one particular pigeon an encouraging nod. "No, no, Bartholomew," he cooed, "you're anticipating the turn." I looked around at the blank, hurried faces of the passersby, and a genuine, terrifying thought surfaced: what if he was the only one making any sense? In a world of deadlines and digital noise, maybe a pigeon waltz was the most rational activity imaginable. I took another bite of my sandwich, suddenly unsure.
