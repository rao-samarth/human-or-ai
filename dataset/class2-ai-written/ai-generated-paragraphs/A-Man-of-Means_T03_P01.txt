They call him a visionary now. You see his name etched on the plaque of the new library, hear it whispered with reverence at the diner. They talk about his foresight, his incredible business acumen, as if he were some kind of prophet who saw the future of this forgotten little town. But I remember him from school, the boy who once tried to pay for his lunch with a shiny rock he was convinced was gold. He bought that useless, flooded quarry on the edge of town not as an investment, but because he liked to skip stones there. He had no plan, no strategy. It was a whim. And then the surveyors, doing a routine county assessment, found the lithium deposit. Now he stands on stages, bathed in light, accepting awards for his brilliance, and I just feel this cold, hollow space in my chest. He didn’t climb the mountain; he just happened to be standing at the top when it rose from the earth.
