Every day in this concrete maze, you see the same old show. The guy in the pickup truck, a vehicle big enough to house a family of four, leans on his horn as if the sheer volume will magically part the sea of yellow cabs. He revs his engine, a modern-day gorilla beating his chest, convinced his noise and steel are a declaration of dominance. It’s almost cute. While he’s busy performing his little power play for an audience of annoyed pedestrians, some unassuming courier on an electric scooter has already glanced at a traffic app, noted the jackknifed semi two avenues over, and is now calmly zipping through a service alley. The big guy gets the momentary thrill of being the loudest idiot in the gridlock, but the quiet one actually gets where they're going. It's always the same pathetic story: the ones who roar the loudest are usually just stuck in a cage of their own making, too dense to even look for the key.
