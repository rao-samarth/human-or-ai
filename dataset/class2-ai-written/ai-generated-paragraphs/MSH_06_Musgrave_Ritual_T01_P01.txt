Every morning, I watch Mr. Albright arrange the three items on his desk: the silver fountain pen, the smooth grey stone he brought back from some beach, and the little succulent. My coworkers think it’s just a tic, a bit of fastidious habit from an old-timer. They see clutter being ordered. They’re missing the entire point, of course. It's a pre-cartographic ritual for finding one's bearings, a way of mapping the day's intentions. The pen points toward the goal, the stone grounds the effort in reality, and the plant represents the successful outcome. He's not just preparing for the quarterly review; he's aligning his whole world. Everyone else just scrolls through their phones, completely oblivious to the real power being invoked in cubicle 7B.
