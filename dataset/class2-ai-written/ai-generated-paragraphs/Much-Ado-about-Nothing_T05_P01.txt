The champagne flute feels cold against my palm, a stark contrast to the warmth of the hand resting on the small of my back. Everyone adores him. My mother cries happy tears when she sees us, and my friends are already planning the bachelorette party in their heads. He just said something charming to the host, and the table laughed appreciatively. This is it, the picture-perfect life I was raised to desire. So why does my stomach clench every time he calls me ‘my love’? A ‘yes’ would be so easy. It would make everyone so happy, a neat and tidy resolution to the story they’ve all been watching. But the silence that would follow that one simple word feels more terrifying than any argument I could possibly start by leaving.
