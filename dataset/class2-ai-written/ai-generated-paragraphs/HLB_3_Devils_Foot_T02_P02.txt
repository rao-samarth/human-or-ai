My uncle was holding court by the fireplace, recounting a story about an old business rival who had cheated him decades ago. The man never faced any legal repercussions, a fact that used to eat at my uncle. But then he described how the rival’s life slowly unraveled in other ways: a series of personal betrayals, a loss of reputation, an isolation that money couldn't fix. It wasn't about divine retribution or some cosmic scorecard. It was simpler, more organic. Some actions create a kind of internal corrosion, a hollowing out that makes a person brittle. Eventually, life just applies a little pressure, and they shatter under the weight of their own compromised character. Our formal systems for righting wrongs seem so crude in comparison, focused on single acts, while this other, slower accounting examines the whole person. The laughter from the kitchen brought me back, and I realized no one else was even listening to the old story.
