He keeps pointing at the chart, his finger tracing the upward curve as if those lines and figures could somehow negate the hollow space that’s opened up in my chest. He explains the projections, his voice calm and level, and I know he thinks he’s winning the argument with reason. Every percentage point he quotes feels like another small stone dropped into my pocket, weighing me down while he talks about upward momentum. He can't chart a gut feeling. He doesn't understand that walking away is the only move left, not because it’s strategically sound or financially prudent, but because staying has become a physical impossibility. The air is too thick. He’s arguing with a ghost, fighting a battle that was lost weeks ago, not on a balance sheet, but right here, in the quiet certainty that I am already gone.
