I see him across the ballroom. Uncle Martin has cornered the bride’s father, a man whose posture suggests he was carved from granite. In his hand, Martin is swirling a glass of deep red wine. He’s leaning in, whispering conspiratorially, and I know exactly which magic trick is about to unfold—the one with the vanishing handkerchief that has a fifty percent chance of ending in a catastrophic spill. My legs are tensed, ready to sprint across the polished floor and create a diversion, but I can’t move. There’s a gleam in my uncle’s eye, a pure, unadulterated joy in the performance he believes is about to dazzle everyone. To stop him would be a kindness, a social rescue mission. It would also be a profound cruelty, puncturing that bubble of magnificent self-confidence. So I just stand here, frozen, half-wishing for the miracle and half-bracing for the inevitable crimson splash on that immaculate cream dinner jacket.
