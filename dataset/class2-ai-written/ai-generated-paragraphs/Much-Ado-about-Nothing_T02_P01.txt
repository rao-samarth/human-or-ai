I watched him from across the ballroom, a flute of cheap champagne warming in my hand. My boss, that is. He had the investor cornered near the silent auction table, his smile so wide and genuine it could have powered the chandeliers. I knew every word falling from his lips was a carefully constructed fiction, a beautiful story about quarterly projections and user engagement that didn't exist outside of that conversation. He was selling a ghost. And the investor was buying it. A part of me felt a familiar churn of disgust, but it was quickly silenced by a stronger, colder thought. That beautifully told lie was our payroll for the next six months. It was the bridge we had to build out of thin air to get to the other side, and I just had to stand here and watch him lay the planks, one untruth at a time.
