I’m laying my cards on the table, and you’re just shuffling the deck. That’s what this is. Every time I offer a simple truth, you treat it like an opening move in a game I never agreed to play. You parry with a joke. You counter with a perfectly timed, devastatingly charming observation that changes the subject entirely. It’s brilliant, I’ll give you that. You’ve built an entire arsenal out of cleverness, and I'm left disarmed. But I am not an opponent to be outmaneuvered, and this isn't a debate to be won. So put down your weapons. Just for a minute. Admit that this exhilarating, exhausting back-and-forth isn't just a performance. Admit that the prize you're fighting for is the same one I am.
