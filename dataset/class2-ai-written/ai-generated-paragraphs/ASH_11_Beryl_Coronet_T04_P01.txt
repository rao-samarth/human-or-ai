The hum of the tires on the wet asphalt was the only sound in the car for nearly an hour before I finally spoke. “You used the emergency money, didn’t you?” My sister didn’t even flinch, just kept her eyes locked on the gray ribbon of highway stretching ahead. Her knuckles were white on the steering wheel. I saw the confirmation in that tense grip before she even opened her mouth. That fund wasn't for a down payment on some condo I'd never see; it was our parents' final gift to us both, a safety net for a real crisis. “It was an investment,” she said, her voice clipped and sterile, as if describing a business transaction and not the quiet theft of my future. I just leaned my head against the cool glass of the passenger window, watching the rain blur the world into streaks of meaningless color. It felt like she hadn't just spent the money, but had cashed in the very idea of us.
