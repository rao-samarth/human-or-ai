Our town is a real gem, or so the brochures claim. Tourists eat it up, of course. They wander down Main Street, admiring the meticulously restored Victorian facades and the hanging flower baskets, calling it all so 'charming' and 'authentic.' They don’t know that the cheerful owner of the antique shop is a notorious gossip who can ruin a reputation before your coffee gets cold. They don’t hear the screaming matches that erupt from behind the perfectly manicured hedges of Elm Street every Saturday night. Everyone smiles and waves at the annual Founder’s Day parade, a beautiful performance of neighborly affection, conveniently forgetting who is suing whom over property lines and whose son just got his third DUI expunged by a well-connected uncle. It's a wonderful place to live, as long as you have a high tolerance for hypocrisy and a good eye for reading the fine print on a smile.
