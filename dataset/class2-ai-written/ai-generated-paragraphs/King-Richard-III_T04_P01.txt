You accuse me of twisting words, but you misunderstand their purpose entirely. You cling to this naive idea of a single, solid truth that language is supposed to perfectly reflect, like a flawless mirror. That’s a child’s view of the world. Words are not mirrors; they are tools. They are the levers and pulleys we use to construct a shared reality, to move people, to build consensus where none existed before. I didn't present a falsehood. I simply chose the most effective architecture for the facts at my disposal, arranging them into a structure that served a necessary purpose. What you call deception is simply superior craftsmanship. You’re not angry that I lied; you’re angry that the story I built is more compelling, more real to everyone else, than the simple, unadorned one you’re left holding.
