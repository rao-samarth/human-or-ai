That gaping hole across the street used to be the old Merchants Bank. I can hear the two women next to me planning a bachelorette party in Tulum, meticulously debating flight times and hotel packages. They’re building something, a memory, a future, while a crew with jackhammers just finished un-building a century's worth of somebody else's. It’s strange how we operate on such different timescales. Theirs is all about next June. Mine, right now, is stuck on the quiet, relentless process that turns brick to rubble. It doesn't just happen to buildings. Every grand plan, every promise whispered in the dark, every empire—it all eventually meets its own version of that wrecking ball. We're all just tenants with non-negotiable eviction notices, pretending we own the place.
