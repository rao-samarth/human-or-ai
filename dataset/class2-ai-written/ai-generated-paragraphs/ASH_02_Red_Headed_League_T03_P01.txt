I know what you must think, seeing the logs, the repeated late-night entries. The reports of me moving the furniture around his study seem deranged, a senseless ritual performed in grief. An inch here, a slight rotation there. It wasn’t madness, though I’ll admit I felt it creeping in some nights. He once told me, as a joke, that the only thing keeping his old house standing was a delicate balance of pressure and weight, a concept he found amusing. After he died, I found his structural diagrams filled with strange annotations. I realized it wasn't a joke. He’d built a failsafe into the house itself, a sequence of minor adjustments to relieve stress on a cracked foundation beam. Shifting that heavy desk by a specific measure each month was the only thing preventing a catastrophic collapse. My bizarre dance with his belongings was the only thing holding up the floor beneath our feet.
