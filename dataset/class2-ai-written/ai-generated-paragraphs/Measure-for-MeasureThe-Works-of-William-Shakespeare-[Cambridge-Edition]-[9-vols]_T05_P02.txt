The town square always looked perfect in photographs. The central gazebo gleamed with fresh white paint, and the flowerbeds lining the walkways burst with professionally arranged color. Tourists often paused on the cobblestones, capturing the quaint storefronts with their polished brass signs, believing they had found something authentic, something preserved from a simpler time. A closer look, however, revealed a different story. The Book Nook's windows were papered over from the inside with curling brown kraft paper. Fine cracks webbed the foundation of the pristine gazebo, and the beloved General Store was merely a convincing facade; behind its gleaming glass front lay a vast, dusty emptiness. It was a beautiful stage, meticulously maintained for an audience that never stayed long enough to notice the play had ended years ago.
