The highway lights smeared across the rain-slicked window, but Elias, wedged in the back seat, wasn't watching them. Up front, Mark was driving, and Chloe was laughing at something he’d just said. Her laughter tapered off as he spoke again, his voice low but clear over the hum of the tires. 'It’ll be easier once we’ve settled the deposit without him.' A beat of thick silence followed. Elias saw Chloe's hand dart out to touch Mark’s arm, a silent, frantic command. In the rearview mirror, their eyes met for a fraction of a second, a shared glance of pure panic that was more damning than any confession. The easy atmosphere of the long drive evaporated, replaced by something cold and brittle. Elias turned back to the window, the familiar shapes of his friends in the dim glow of the dashboard now feeling like strangers. Every shared joke from the past eight hours, every plan they had made together, suddenly felt hollow, a carefully constructed stage for a play in which he was the only one who didn't know his part.
