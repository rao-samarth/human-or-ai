From across the ballroom, I watched them assemble for the photograph, a dynasty in miniature. They arranged themselves with practiced ease, smiles polished for the camera’s flash. Yet, what the lens could never capture was the architecture of their silence, the vast, unacknowledged space between them. It was a structure built years ago, reinforced with every avoided topic and every redirected question, its foundations laid in a moment no one dared revisit. Each member was a custodian of a piece of it, a secret they guarded not out of malice, but from a misguided belief that the shared fiction was more durable than the fractured truth. They thought they were preserving the family, but they were merely curating a museum of what it was supposed to be, a pristine exhibit for public view. The real foundation was eroding beneath their feet, hollowed out by the immense, collective weight of the unspoken.
