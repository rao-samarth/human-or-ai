Don’t you see what’s happening? This isn’t us anymore. A year ago, we were sharing cold pizza on the floor of that tiny apartment, laughing about bills we couldn't pay. That was real. That was ours. Now we’re standing in this empty marble hall with crystal glasses we’re too afraid to touch and a phone that only rings with requests, not conversations. You think this pile of money is a fortress, but it’s just a sandcastle. The tide is already coming in, I can hear it. Every new car, every stupidly expensive party is just another wave washing away who we were. It's a beautiful, shimmering distraction that will vanish the second we get too comfortable, and what will be left? Just us, strangers in a house we don't own, surrounded by the desert we made of our old life. I feel it all slipping away. Can't you?
