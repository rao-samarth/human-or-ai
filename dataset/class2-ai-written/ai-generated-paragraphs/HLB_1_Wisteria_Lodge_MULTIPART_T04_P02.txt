You can always tell when someone's new here. They're the ones who still talk about 'calling the authorities' with a straight face, as if that solves anything. In this town, the official channels are for paperwork and parades, not problems. When that developer from the city started bulldozing through the old grove behind the church, people filed complaints, sure. They made phone calls. They got a lot of sympathetic nods and zero action. Then, one morning, every single piece of his expensive machinery was meticulously filled with quick-dry cement. An absolute tragedy, the sheriff said, shaking his head for the local news camera. A real whodunit. Meanwhile, the rest of us just sipped our coffee and admired how peacefully the birds were singing again. Justice here doesn’t arrive in a siren-blaring car; it just sort of… happens overnight.
