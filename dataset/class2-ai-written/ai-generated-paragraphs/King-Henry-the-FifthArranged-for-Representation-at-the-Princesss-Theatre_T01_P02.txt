Don’t you dare tell me to be strong. You see the person on the podium, the one with the steady voice and the easy smile, and you think that’s all there is. You have no idea what it costs to build that man every single morning. Every decision is a gamble with someone else’s future, a cold calculation where the numbers have faces and names that I see in my sleep. I have to project absolute certainty when all I feel is the crushing weight of a thousand possible failures, a thousand ways I could be wrong. They need a symbol, an unwavering pillar to believe in, but I am just a man holding it all up, and my bones are grinding to dust under the strain. This isn't leadership; it's a constant, terrifying performance, and I'm forgetting who I am when the curtain finally falls.
