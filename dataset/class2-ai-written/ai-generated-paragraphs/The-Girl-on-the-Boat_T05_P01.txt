It all began, as these things so often do, with a single rogue ice cube. I’d merely intended to get a glass of water, but it shot from the dispenser with such velocity that it skittered across the kitchen floor, coming to rest directly under the pedal of the bin. When I stooped to retrieve it, my elbow nudged a precariously balanced stack of cookbooks which, in a domino effect I couldn't have planned if I’d tried, sent a single onion rolling off the counter. The onion, obeying laws of physics I don’t pretend to understand, hit the exact corner of a floorboard that always squeaks, startling the dog. His subsequent frantic leap for safety resulted in him body-slamming the back door, which I’d apparently forgotten to latch properly. So, no, I have no logical explanation for why I was on my hands and knees in a puddle of melted ice, staring at my dog who was now sitting smugly in the moonlit garden in the middle of the night. It just happened.
