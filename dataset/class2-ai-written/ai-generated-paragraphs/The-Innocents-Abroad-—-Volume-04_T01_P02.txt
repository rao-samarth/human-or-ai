I stood on the windswept cliff where the old stories said a giant had once slept. At first, all I saw was rock, sea, and the sharp cries of gulls. The reality was simple, a beautiful but ordinary coastline. But as I walked, I began to notice things—the strange, smooth hollows in the stone, exactly where a massive shoulder might have rested, and the way the wind sounded less like a breeze and more like a slow, ancient breath. The legends weren't just tales anymore; they were a different way of seeing. They didn’t replace the scientific explanation for the geology, but instead layered a parallel truth over it, one full of wonder. It made the world feel bigger, not smaller, as if to prove that even in our modern age, there is always room for a little magic to seep through the cracks of what we think we know.
