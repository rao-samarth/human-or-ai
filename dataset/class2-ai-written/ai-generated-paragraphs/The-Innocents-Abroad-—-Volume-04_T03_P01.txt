They say this field was once a villa, but all that’s left is a patch of floor. Under the moonlight, you can still make out the pattern of the tiles—a hunting dog chasing a stag, frozen forever in tiny squares of colored stone. My tent is pitched right over the stag’s head. The locals complain about the mess, the empty cans and the blue plastic sheeting I use for rain, but I think they misunderstand. This is just another layer, isn't it? The Romans had their amphorae; I have my bottles. They built things to last, and in my own way, I’m living in the wreckage of their permanence, which is a kind of permanence itself. People see a dump on top of a ruin, but they don't see the continuity. We're all just trying to keep the weather out.
