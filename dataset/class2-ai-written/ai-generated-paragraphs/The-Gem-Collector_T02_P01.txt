“You don’t think, do you?” His voice was low, cutting through the rustle of dry grass that lined the track. “You just act.” I flinched, pulling my jacket tighter against a wind that had nothing to do with the weather. “I did what needed to be done.” He took a step closer, his shadow falling over me. “What *you* thought needed to be done. Without a word. You were just gone, and I was left here to deal with the silence.” My own anger flared, hot and protective. “Why does it matter so much to you? It’s my life!” The question was meant to wound, to push him away, but it landed wrong. He stopped, his whole body going still. The fury in his eyes dissolved, replaced by a raw, startled confusion as if he was hearing the answer for the first time himself. And in that awful, quiet moment, I saw it too. This entire fight wasn't about my leaving; it was about the terror of him being left behind.
