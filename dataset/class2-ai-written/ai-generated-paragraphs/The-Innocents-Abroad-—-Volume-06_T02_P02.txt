You know, looking at that little replica of the old city that Uncle David brought back from his pilgrimage is a strange feeling. It’s beautiful, of course, very detailed. But I keep thinking about how you take a place defined by centuries of faith, conflict, and genuine human struggle and then… shrink it? You put it in a box with a price tag. It feels like the entire point gets lost in translation. All that history, all the dust and the prayers and the blood, gets polished down into something you can put on your mantelpiece. It's as if the only way we can connect with these profound moments anymore is by purchasing a sanitized souvenir, walking through a museum where the real story is kept behind glass, something to be viewed but no longer truly felt.
