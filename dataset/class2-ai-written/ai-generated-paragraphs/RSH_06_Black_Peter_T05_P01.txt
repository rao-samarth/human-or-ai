You know, I watch you at those galas, shaking hands and accepting plaques for your generosity. Everyone sees the city's benefactor, the great man with the easy smile and the open checkbook, and they applaud your speeches about integrity and building a better future. But I see something else entirely. I see the flicker of contempt in your eyes when a waiter is too slow, the same cold dismissal you give me when I ask about the late-night calls or the locked files in your study. I hear the way your voice changes, dropping an octave, the moment the front door closes and the performance is over for the day. They all buy the act. They have to. But I live with the man behind the curtain, and I wonder, with all this polished marble and philanthropic gold, who are you really trying to convince? Them, or yourself?
