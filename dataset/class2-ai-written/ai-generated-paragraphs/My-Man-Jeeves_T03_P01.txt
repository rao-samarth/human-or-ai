We build these intricate cages for ourselves, don't we? A scaffolding of casual promises, of agreeable nods to opinions we never held, of a personality curated for an audience of acquaintances. Walking through the evening throng, the sheer weight of this constructed self can feel heavier than the buildings leaning in from all sides. Each passing face is a universe of its own, blissfully unaware of the minor, exhausting drama you’ve scripted for your own life. And in that anonymity lies a profound permission. You can simply stop. Stop upholding the narrative. Let the carefully placed bricks of your persona fall where they may. The silence that follows isn't emptiness but space. It’s the quiet realization that the only person demanding this performance was you, and the stage, you now see, was always empty.
