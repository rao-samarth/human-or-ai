You should see him right now, gleaming under these ridiculous chandeliers and accepting congratulations as if he's earned them. It’s the same man from all those depositions last spring, the one whose name was supposed to be ruined. But I suppose a reputation is just another asset to be managed. A few sealed documents, one very convenient change of heart from a key witness, and the whole ugly business simply evaporated from the public record. Now he’s here, shaking the right hands and making a sizable donation, and everyone is applauding. It’s a strange feeling, watching a verdict being delivered not by a jury, but by the clinking of champagne glasses in a room full of people who have a vested interest in forgetting.
