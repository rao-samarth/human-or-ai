You think this road you’re on leads somewhere, don’t you? You see that one moment of finality, of righting the wrong, and you believe it will bring you peace. I get it. I really do. But you’re so focused on the destination that you don’t see what you’re burning for fuel along the way. It starts small. You push a friend away, you lie to someone who trusts you, you tell yourself it’s all for the greater good of settling this one score. Soon, your entire world is just this one dark obsession, and every choice you make is measured only by how it serves that single purpose. And I have to ask you, when it's all over, when you finally get what you want, what happens then? You'll be left standing in the ashes of everything you sacrificed, with nothing but the cold satisfaction of having been right. Look at me. Is that what you want to become?
