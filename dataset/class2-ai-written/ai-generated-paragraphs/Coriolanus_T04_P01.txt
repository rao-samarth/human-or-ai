Sitting here in this crowded German train station, I find myself watching a young boy offer his seat to an elderly woman, and his mother gives him this small, almost imperceptible nod of approval. It’s funny, the things that stick. I don’t think my own mom ever explicitly taught me a list of rules for being a good person, but her approval was always the sun I oriented myself by. It became an internal guidance system. Now, thousands of miles from home, I still find myself straightening the cutlery at my table or making sure to thank the bus driver, hearing her quiet satisfaction in the back of my mind. It’s not a voice, really, but more like a foundational hum beneath my own thoughts. She built the scaffolding of my conscience, and I just live inside it, no matter the country code.
