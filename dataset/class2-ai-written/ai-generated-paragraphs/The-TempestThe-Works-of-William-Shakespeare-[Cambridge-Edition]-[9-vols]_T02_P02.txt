My uncle is telling the story again, the one about the summer of the broken boat, and the laughter that follows is as reliable as the setting sun. With each retelling, the details shift, polishing themselves into a smoother, funnier narrative than the jagged memory I hold. I look around the table at the nodding heads and smiling faces, and a strange thought surfaces: perhaps we are not recalling a shared past so much as we are co-authoring it in real time. The event itself is gone. All that remains are these echoes, these crafted reflections that we pass back and forth across the dinner plates, each person accepting this communal version as the definitive truth because the alternative—that we each exist in a slightly different, private history—is too lonely to consider. The wine tastes real, the warmth from the fireplace feels real, but the very foundation of our connection might just be a story we've all agreed to believe.
