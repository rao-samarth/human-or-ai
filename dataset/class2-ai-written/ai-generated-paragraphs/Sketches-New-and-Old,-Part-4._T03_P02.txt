A fist flew, clumsy and wide, and then a knife appeared, glinting in the afternoon sun. Before anyone could properly intervene, or even decide if they wanted to, a single shot cracked the thick silence. Jedediah slumped against a hitching post, a look of profound surprise on his face. Silas stared at his own smoking pistol as if it were a foreign object he’d just discovered in his hand. Across the road, the hen in question pecked placidly at a beetle in the dust, entirely unconcerned with the human drama it had failed to inspire.
