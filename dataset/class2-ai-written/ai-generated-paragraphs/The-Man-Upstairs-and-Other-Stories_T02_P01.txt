I’m on a bus somewhere between cities I can’t pronounce, scrolling through old phone notes just to pass the time. I stumbled upon a file from last winter, a story opening I was so sure was *it*. Reading it now is strange. The words feel like they were written by a different person, someone more optimistic and definitely less tired. I remember the electric feeling of typing them out, the world falling away. Now, I just see the holes. I see the clumsy sentences and the dead-end plot. Part of me wants to delete it, to just let it go. Another part, the stubborn part, wonders if there’s a single thread in there worth pulling, even if it unravels everything I thought it was.
