No, don't look at your phone. Look at me. I heard what you told them at dinner last night, the whole story about my family, even the part I specifically asked you to keep to yourself. For a few seconds, standing there by the kitchen door, the noise of the party just faded into this awful ringing sound. But it's alright. Really. I’ve been thinking about it, and you were probably just trying to make them understand me better, to explain why I get so quiet sometimes. It was a heavy thing to ask you to hold onto, and maybe it was unfair of me to give you that burden in the first place. I shouldn't have done that. So please, just forget I ever said anything. We’re fine. Are you going to finish that coffee?
