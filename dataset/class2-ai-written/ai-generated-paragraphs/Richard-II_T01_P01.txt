You know, I was just staring at that portrait over there, the one with the severe-looking monarch. It’s not the gold leaf or the stony expression that gets me. It’s the sheer, unshakeable confidence. He genuinely believed, and made millions of others believe, that his right to rule was woven into the fabric of the universe, a fact as solid as a mountain. But that's the part that feels like a magic trick, isn't it? It’s like a collective dream we all agree to have. The moment enough people wake up, the crown is just a heavy hat and the throne is just a particularly uncomfortable chair. The whole system, that whole world, wasn't held up by armies or walls, but by an idea. And an idea, as powerful as it is, can just… evaporate.
