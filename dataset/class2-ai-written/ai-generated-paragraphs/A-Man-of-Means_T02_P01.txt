I admit I was the one who changed the numbers. He called it "narrative shaping," a harmless way to smooth out the bumps before the quarterly review. He had this way of making it sound like a clever strategy, a secret we were in on together against the soulless expectations from the top floor. I was young, I suppose, and eager to be part of an inner circle. So when he slid the spreadsheet over and pointed to the cells, explaining how a few small adjustments would benefit the entire department, I believed him. It was never framed as a lie; it was presented as teamwork, as loyalty. I only understood my real role much later, when the investigation started and his name was nowhere on the access logs. Mine was, of course. It turns out loyalty was a one-way street he had paved just for me.
