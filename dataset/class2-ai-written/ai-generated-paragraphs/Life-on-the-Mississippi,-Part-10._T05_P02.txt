You’ve learned all the forms, yes. You can replicate my work so perfectly that even I sometimes have to look twice. But you are mistaking the map for the territory. For years, you have followed my path, learning every turn, every landmark, and you see it as the only way forward. The final step isn't about perfecting that path. It’s about understanding the landscape so completely that you no longer need my map at all. It’s about what you do when you face something I never prepared you for, a challenge for which no instructions exist. That is the moment the crutch of my teaching must be thrown away. It’s the point where you must be willing to get lost, to trust your own navigation, even if it means failing spectacularly. That is where you will finally find your own voice, and my role in your journey will truly be over.
