The house is completely still, a state it only achieves long after midnight. In this silence, it’s easy to think about the stories people tell themselves, the ones bound in paper on the shelves. They offer such clean, satisfying arcs: a perilous journey with a clear destination, a love affair defined by grand, cinematic gestures. But real life doesn't operate on a three-act structure. The conflicts are rarely so noble or well-defined. A disagreement over finances isn't a duel at dawn; it's a tense conversation over a cluttered kitchen table. The slow drain of exhaustion isn't a monster to be vanquished, but a quiet, persistent hum in the background of every day. The appeal of those epic narratives becomes clearer in moments like this. They provide a blueprint for a life that feels more significant, even if the daily, unwritten chapters are about fixing the dishwasher and remembering to take out the recycling.
