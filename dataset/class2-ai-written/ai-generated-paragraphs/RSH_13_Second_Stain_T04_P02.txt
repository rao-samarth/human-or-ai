I watch the reflections of brake lights bleed across the wet pavement, a thousand fleeting stories in every car that rushes past. He's beside me, laughing at something on his phone, completely oblivious, and I want to keep it that way. It’s easier to let him believe the sanitized version I fed him, the one where everything turned out fine, where the hard edges were smoothed over. Telling him the whole, jagged truth would only break something inside him that I don't think could ever be fixed. So I hold it in, this heavy, unshared knowledge. It's a lonely kind of protection, carrying the burden so he doesn't have to. Sometimes, standing here in a city of millions, I feel like the only one who knows the real story, and I wonder if the silence I’m giving him is a gift or just a different kind of cage.
