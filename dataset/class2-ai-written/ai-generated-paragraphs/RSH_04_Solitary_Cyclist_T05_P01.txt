The noise here is the worst part. It's a constant press of bodies and voices, a soup of sound you can never get clean from, and everyone is watching, always. People talk about getting away from it all, buying some little house out where the roads turn to dirt. They imagine quiet mornings and birdsong, but they don't understand the real appeal. The true gift of all that space isn't peace; it's privacy. It’s the profound freedom of knowing that if a sound is made—a sharp one, a sudden one—the nearest neighbor is miles away, probably deafened by the wind in the trees anyway. You could do anything out there. You could dig a hole deep in the rich soil and bury a mistake, and the only witness would be the moon. That silence isn't empty; it's an accomplice.
