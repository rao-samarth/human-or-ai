For the love of all that is sacred, put down the pen. The bells are still tolling for your father. Outside this door, the council sits in a stone-cold silence, waiting for a word, for a sign, for *anything* from their new king. And you sit here, agonizing over the precise shade of blue for a river that doesn't exist. We are not discussing the cartography of a fairy tale; we are discussing the fate of millions of people who are looking to you. To you! There are grain shortages in the north and border disputes in the south. The only thing preventing this entire nation from collapsing into chaos is the simple, biological fact that you were his son. Your blood is the only reason they are not already at each other's throats. So please, stop coloring in your imaginary mountains and start figuring out how to rule a real kingdom.
