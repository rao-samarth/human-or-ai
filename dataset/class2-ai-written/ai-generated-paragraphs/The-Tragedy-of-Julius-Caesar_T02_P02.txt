This quiet corner in a city whose language I don't speak offers a strange kind of clarity. My mind keeps drifting back to a former colleague, someone I once deeply respected. They began with a clear, almost noble vision, a desire to build something meaningful. But somewhere along the way, the goal itself dissolved, replaced by the simple, voracious need for ascent. Each success was no longer a milestone to be celebrated but merely a consumed resource, fueling the next climb. The people around them, once partners in a shared effort, slowly became either assets to be leveraged or obstacles to be dismantled. It was a gradual erosion of principle, so subtle that perhaps even they didn't notice the person they were becoming. In the end, they reached the summit they had imagined, only to find themselves entirely alone, the architect of an empty kingdom.
