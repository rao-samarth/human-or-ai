The house settles at this hour, all groans and sighs, but it’s the silence I notice most. People talk about trust, about loyalty, as if they're immutable forces of nature. They aren't. I remember his face when I explained the necessity of it, the way his disappointment felt so performative, so childish. He simply doesn't understand that every messy variable, every emotional complication, can be neatly resolved with a number. It’s not about being cold; it’s about being efficient. This view, these quiet walls, the very air I breathe—they are all products of transactions, of problems solved rather than felt. He saw a friendship ending. I saw a liability being removed from the books. Ultimately, it’s just cleaner.
