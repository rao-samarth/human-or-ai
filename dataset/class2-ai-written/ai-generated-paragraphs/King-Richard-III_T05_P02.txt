You’re good at this, I’ll give you that. The sound of my mother’s laughter drifted in from the living room, a jarring counterpoint to the venom in my voice. He flinched, turning from the window. "What are you talking about?" he asked, but his eyes wouldn’t meet mine. "This," I said, gesturing vaguely toward the noise. "The smiling, the polite questions about work. The whole performance. How do you do it? Doesn't it ever just... choke you?" His jaw tightened, and for a second, the cheerful uncle I’d been watching all afternoon vanished, replaced by someone hollowed out and haunted. "Every single second," he finally whispered, the words barely audible over the party. "You think I get a moment's peace? It follows me into every room. It sits at every table. It’s always there, right behind my eyes, waiting. So, no. It doesn't choke me. It's the very air I breathe."
