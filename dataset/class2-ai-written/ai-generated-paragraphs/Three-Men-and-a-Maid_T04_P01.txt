Around me, the conversation hummed with a peculiar, low-grade urgency. My relatives, comfortable in their inherited security, spoke of sailing itineraries and the abysmal service at a new alpine resort, their voices tight with a gravity usually reserved for genuine crisis. It’s a strange phenomenon to observe. When all the great, primal struggles for survival are systematically dismantled and removed from a life, what rushes in to fill the void? It seems the human capacity for anxiety is a constant, a fixed volume that must be occupied. Lacking true threats like hunger or ruin, it simply attaches itself to smaller, more manageable proxies: the perceived judgment in a rival’s glance, the social cost of a poorly-timed joke, the harrowing ordeal of a delayed shipment of Italian marble. We have built these beautiful, gilded cages to protect us from the wilderness, only to find we have populated them with ghosts of our own making.
