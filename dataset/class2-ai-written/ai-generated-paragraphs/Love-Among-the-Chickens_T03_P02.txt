I came out here for the supposed peace and quiet, a noble escape from the city’s constant grind. Turns out, quiet is a relative term. Back in the city, my brain had a highly-developed filter for the chaos: the wail of sirens, my upstairs neighbor's questionable techno phase, the pre-dawn garbage truck symphony. It was a predictable, almost comforting hum I could easily tune out. Here, my sole antagonist is a rooster who seems to have a broken internal clock. He doesn’t just crow at dawn; he crows to announce the mailman's arrival, a particularly interesting cloud, or what I can only assume is a deep-seated existential crisis. My neighbor thinks it's hilarious. She told me his name is Gary and he’s just ‘got a lot to say.’ I find myself longing for the simple, anonymous roar of a traffic jam.
