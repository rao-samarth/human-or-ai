When the town council abruptly disbanded over a budget impasse, the initial silence was mistaken for peace. Within a week, however, small fractures began to show. The volunteer-run library reduced its hours, citing a lack of official coordination, and the weekly farmers market became a contentious space as vendors argued over stall placement, a task once managed by a council liaison. Then, larger issues surfaced. A developer, who had been waiting for a zoning variance, simply began clearing a wooded lot near the reservoir, claiming the moratorium had lapsed with the government that issued it. Without a formal body to appeal to, residents could only form informal, and often conflicting, protest groups. The established order, for all its bureaucratic slowness, had provided a common framework for disagreement. Its absence didn't create freedom so much as a landscape of competing, unresolvable claims where every small decision carried the weight of a precedent no one had agreed to set.
