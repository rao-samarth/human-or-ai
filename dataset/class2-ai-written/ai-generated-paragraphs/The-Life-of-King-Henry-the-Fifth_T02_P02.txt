Across the dinner table, my cousin asked my great-uncle about the war again, his voice filled with the earnest excitement of someone who’s only seen it in movies. He wanted to know about heroism, about the grand charges and the medals that came after. A silence fell as everyone waited for a familiar story of valor. Instead, my uncle spoke quietly about the sheer, grinding boredom of it all, punctuated by moments of pure, senseless chaos. He described the smell of wet wool that never left, the metallic taste of rations, and the constant, gnawing fear not of a heroic death, but of a pointless one. He didn't speak of enemies or nations, only of the faces of the boys beside him. My cousin’s eager expression slowly faded, replaced by a confusion that I understood completely. He had asked for a legend and was given the truth.
