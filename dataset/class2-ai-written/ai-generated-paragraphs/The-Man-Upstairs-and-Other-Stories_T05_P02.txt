You’re holding that statement like it’s evidence from a crime scene. Seriously, look at you. It was one dinner. I just wanted us to feel like normal people for a few hours, not like two accountants closing the books on a failed business, which is what every evening with you has become. But that’s the issue, isn’t it? You get some kind of satisfaction from the panic, from turning every small joy into a future catastrophe. This silence, this heavy, calculated quiet you’re deploying right now, is so much louder than yelling. You make me feel like I have to apologize for wanting a single nice thing, as if my desire for a moment of relief is the actual source of our problems. It’s never about the money; it’s about you needing to be the one who worries more.
