Don’t you dare talk to me about blood. What does that even mean? A shared pattern in our cells? My father—the man who raised me—was the one who stayed up all night when I had a fever, his hand cool on my forehead. My mother taught me how to stand up for myself, her voice the one I heard in my head when I was scared. They gave me my memories. They built my conscience, piece by agonizing piece. You gave me the color of my eyes, and for that I'm sure there's a biological reason, but you didn't give me my soul. Every single thing you think you recognize in me was earned in a life you had no part in. It was forged in rooms you've never seen and shaped by hands you've never touched. You are a ghost, a biological footnote to a story I wrote myself.
