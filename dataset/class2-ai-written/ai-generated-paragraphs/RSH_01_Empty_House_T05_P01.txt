In the quiet hours of the afternoon, a peculiar stillness settles over the town, a weight heavier than humidity. The children’s laughter from the park seems distant, muted. Down by the creek, where the old willows droop, the water carries a faint, prismatic shimmer on its surface, a slick of rainbow colours that everyone has seen for so long they no longer notice it. People blame the endless fatigue on the long winters, the persistent coughs on the pollen, the strange metallic taste in the tap water on old pipes. They go about their days with a slow, resigned grace, unaware that the very thing that built their town, the silent, hulking factory on the hill, is patiently unmaking them from the inside out. Each sunset paints the smoke from its stacks in beautiful, soft colours, a daily masterpiece of slow-acting poison that no one thinks to question.
