Honestly, just look at them. It’s a pathetic little ballet, isn’t it? They drift and cluster, pretending to absorb the art, but all they’re really doing is running a constant, silent value calculation on everyone else. See that man by the window? He thinks latching onto the curator’s assistant is a power move, but it’s just desperate. The real art form here is calculated indifference; you have to project an aura of being completely content on your own, forcing them to make the first move. It’s a game of social arbitrage, and most of these people are terrible at it. I’m not really interested, of course, but you have to understand the rules to win. Excuse me, I see Clara over there. I can’t stand her, but talking to her for five minutes now will pay dividends later.
