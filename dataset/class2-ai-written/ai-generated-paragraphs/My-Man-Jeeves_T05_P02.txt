The midday crowd surged around the corner, a chaotic river of bodies and noise, but they had formed a small, stagnant eddy around the man on the plastic crate. He was screaming about conspiracies, his face flushed, gesturing wildly at the indifferent skyscrapers. It was all so predictable, this theater of manufactured outrage. The logic was a house of cards, each point resting on a flimsy assumption that the audience was too eager to question. I could have just walked past like everyone else. But the sheer inelegance of his argument was an offense, so I simply waited for a pause and asked, loud enough for those nearby, “And what if you’re just wrong about the first part?” A flicker of confusion crossed his face. The question, so basic, had no place in his script. He stammered, the momentum gone, and the little crowd began to fray at the edges, their brief fascination broken by a single, simple pinprick of reason. I didn't wait to see the end; my work was done.
