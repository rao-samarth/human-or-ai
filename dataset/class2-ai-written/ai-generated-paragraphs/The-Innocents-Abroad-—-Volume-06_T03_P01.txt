The house settles into its late-night hum, a sound that seems to amplify the silence. In this quiet, it’s easy to question the things that demand so much noise during the day. We are encouraged to build our lives on the bedrock of certainty, to accept a foundation we are forbidden to inspect. It feels like being handed a sealed container and told its contents are precious beyond measure, but that to open it, even to peek inside, would be the ultimate failing. What a strange paradox, to praise the destination so highly while condemning any curiosity about the path. There seems to be a greater integrity not in the easy comfort of assuming the container is full, but in the honest admission that we can’t possibly know, and that perhaps the real courage lies in living with that empty space.
