Watching the green hills roll by the train window, I felt the familiar weight of our years of stubborn silence, a quiet ache that had become a part of me. We had both stood our ground, guardians of grievances that had long since lost their meaning, building walls where a foundation used to be. But today, something shifted. Perhaps it was the distance, or the sight of strangers sharing a laugh across the aisle, but the entire fortress of my pride seemed to crumble into dust. The reason for it all felt so small from here, insignificant against the vast, open sky. I realized the prize for winning this silent war was just more silence, an empty inheritance. Pulling out my phone, my thumb hovered over his name. The landscape outside suddenly seemed brighter, less of a blur and more like a path forward, a journey I no longer had to make alone.
