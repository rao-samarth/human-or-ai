The sound of my aunt’s laughter is too loud, almost sharp, in the crowded dining room. My uncle claps me on the shoulder, a gesture that feels less like affection and more like an endorsement. He’s talking about responsibility, about the family’s future, but his voice just sort of merges with the clinking of wine glasses and polite chatter. I find myself staring at my cousin across the table, who’s telling some ridiculous story about his dog getting stuck in a hedge. A simple, stupid story. God, the envy is a physical ache in my chest. My father just sits at the head of the table, a silent anchor in the storm of noise, and he catches my eye. That brief glance holds everything—the expectation, the history, the crushing weight of what comes next. I just smile back, feeling like a fraud in a well-tailored suit, a ghost at my own feast.
