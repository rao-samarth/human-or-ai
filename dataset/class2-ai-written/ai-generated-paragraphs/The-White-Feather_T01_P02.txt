The rusted latch on the old farm gate was cold, biting into her palm as she pushed it shut one last time. Every fiber of her being screamed to turn back, to run to the familiar warmth of the porch light she'd left burning. The silence of the lane was immense, broken only by the whisper of wind through the tall, dry grass. Fear was a physical thing, a knot tightening in her stomach, but her hand didn't tremble as she locked the padlock. Her feet felt like lead, yet she forced them forward, one step and then another, onto the gravel path that led away from everything she had ever known. She didn't look back. She couldn't. This was not about being fearless; it was about walking straight into the heart of her fear and refusing to stop, even as it threatened to swallow her whole. The road stretched on, a grey ribbon into the dawn.
