The wail of a distant siren seemed to pull the air from my lungs, and for a moment, every face in the crowd was a mirror showing me my own failure. My throat closed up; the only response I could imagine was a raw, animal scream that would shatter the afternoon air. The impulse was immense, a tidal wave of pure panic threatening to sweep away everything. But then, a strange quiet settled in the center of the storm inside me. Screaming wouldn't change the facts. Tears wouldn't rearrange the past into something more palatable. The only thing I had left was the sequence of events, the cold chain of cause and effect that led me right here. They could have the performance they seemed to be waiting for, or they could have the unvarnished account. I chose the account, deciding it was the only solid thing to hold onto in the dizzying spin of it all.
