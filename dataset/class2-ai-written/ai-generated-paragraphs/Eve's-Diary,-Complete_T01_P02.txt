The afternoon sun slanted through the grimy windows of the town library, illuminating dust motes dancing in the silent air. He’d found it wedged between a faded gardening almanac and a history of local county fairs: a thin volume with no title on its spine. He opened it randomly. The words inside weren't stories of dragons or distant stars, but descriptions of a city where the light never truly died, where people spoke in a dozen languages on a single street corner, and where art wasn’t just a painting in a stuffy room but a living, breathing part of the concrete itself. A tremor went through him. It was a physical shock. The predictable rhythm of his life—the whistle of the five o’clock train, the smell of cut grass, the drone of gossip—suddenly seemed hollow, a pale imitation of living. This book was not an escape; it was a revelation, a cruel and beautiful promise that the world was infinitely larger than the one he had been given.
