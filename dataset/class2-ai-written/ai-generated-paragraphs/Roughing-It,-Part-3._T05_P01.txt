Oh, do spare me the tragedy. You’re acting as if they didn’t just hand you the keys to the kingdom, instead of merely giving that corner office with the slightly less depressing view of the parking lot to someone else. You’ve been sharpening your elbows for a year, collecting little favors like they were rare stamps, all for a title that amounts to a different font on your business card. You see this as some grand summit to be conquered, don't you? A mountain. Let me tell you what it really is. It’s a slightly higher anthill, with the exact same view of all the other ants scurrying below. The grand prize for all that climbing is just the privilege of looking down and realizing you're still an ant, just one with a better vantage point for the inevitable collapse.
