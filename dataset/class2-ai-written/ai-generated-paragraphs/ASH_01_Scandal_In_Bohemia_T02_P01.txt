You built your entire argument on the assumption that I would try to dismantle your logic piece by piece. It's a beautiful structure, I'll admit, all those interlocking proofs and historical precedents you love so much. But I wasn't interested in the fortress you built. I just watched you, night after night, pacing this very room, and I saw the one thing you never factor into your own equations: your vanity. You always leave a deliberate, elegant flaw in your work, a signature so clever you assume no one else is smart enough to look for it, let alone recognize it. I didn't need to pick the lock. You handed me the key the moment you decided your own genius was the most important part of the puzzle.
