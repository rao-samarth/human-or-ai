"It's my grandma's recipe." Mark took a tentative scoop with a tortilla chip. His eyes widened. "Kevin, this is... this changes everything. I feel so... agreeable." Kevin just smiled. "Yeah, it's an old family secret. Technically, it's the emergency high-calorie nutrient paste developed for deep-cover operatives stationed in politically unstable regions. The secret ingredient is a mild, non-addictive psychotropic agent designed to foster goodwill in hostile negotiations. That's probably why you just agreed to help me move this weekend. Want another scoop?" Mark, already reaching for the bowl, just nodded enthusiastically, completely forgetting he was supposed to be in Bermuda.
