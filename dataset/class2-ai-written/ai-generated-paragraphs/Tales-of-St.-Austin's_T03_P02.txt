I was just trying to read my book on the train when I overheard those two teenagers in the next seats. They were arguing, really getting into it, about some competition between the "Dragons" and the "Wolves." It shot me right back. I'd almost forgotten that feeling, the absolute, all-consuming importance of your house colour. For us, it was red versus blue, and a victory in the swimming carnival felt more significant than any national election. We painted our faces, screamed until our throats were raw, and genuinely believed the other side was populated by villains. It was a loyalty so fierce and so simple. Looking back, it seems almost tribal, this manufactured conflict that shaped our entire school year. But back then? It was the whole world.
