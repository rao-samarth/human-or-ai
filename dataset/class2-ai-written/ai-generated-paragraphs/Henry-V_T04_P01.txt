The train clicked along the rails, a steady rhythm beneath the hum of a dozen conversations. Across the aisle, a grandmother shared spiced nuts from a small bag with a young man glued to his screen, their shared laughter briefly bridging the gap between their worlds. I heard snippets of three different languages, none of which I understood, yet the meaning was clear in the cadence of teasing jokes and gentle reassurances. Outside, the cityscape dissolved into rolling farmland, then gave way to rugged hills, a constant reminder of the sheer scale of the land we all shared. It struck me then, looking at the reflection of all these different faces superimposed over the passing scenery, that this was it. This was the process: not a single, unified voice, but a chorus, finding its harmony in motion.
