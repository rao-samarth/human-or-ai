I watch them from across the square, a small flock huddled around the bronze plaque while a tour guide performs the city’s origin story. He’s got the timing down perfectly—the dramatic pause, the reverent hand gesture toward the spot where, supposedly, the First Founder’s tears turned the soil fertile forever. The crowd soaks it up, their faces earnest and ready to believe. They probably feel a connection, a sense of belonging to something ancient and profound. But I just see the chewing gum plastered over the founder's engraved name and hear the shriek of a taxi horn cutting through the sacred silence. You have to wonder who first told that story, and what they stood to gain. A simple narrative is always more profitable than a complicated one, and people will pay good money to stand on ground that has been declared special.
