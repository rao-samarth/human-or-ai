Sitting on this same park bench, watching the same clock tower strike four, I wonder if I ever really had a say in the matter. It feels like all roads, no matter how far they stretched, were just scenic detours leading back to this square. I think about that job offer in the city, the one I turned down for a reason that seems so flimsy now. Was that my decision, or was I just following a script I hadn't been allowed to read? People here talk about finding their place, but sometimes I think the place finds you, carving out your life with a quiet, relentless patience, like water wearing down a stone. Every face that passes is a story I've known forever, and I can’t shake the feeling that my own story was written long before I learned how to hold a pen. It’s a comfortable thought, in a way. And also a terrifying one.
