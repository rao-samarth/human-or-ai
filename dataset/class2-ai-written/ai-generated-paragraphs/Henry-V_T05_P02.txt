At the town hall meeting, Mr. Abernathy never called it 'demolition.' Instead, he spoke of 'urban renewal' and 'clearing the path for progress.' The century-old courthouse, with its cracked steps and resident pigeons, was not a landmark but a 'liability.' He painted a picture not of loss, but of opportunity, a bright future paved over the inconvenient present. His voice, smooth and reasonable, wrapped around the room, and you could feel the shift as murmurs of agreement began to replace the earlier grumbles of doubt. He never lied, not outright. He simply rearranged the truth, offering a vocabulary that made the unthinkable seem not only acceptable but necessary. The woods at the edge of town were not a sanctuary; they were an 'untapped asset.' The quiet main street was not charming; it was 'commercially stagnant.' He was giving them new words for their world, and with them, new permission to change it.
