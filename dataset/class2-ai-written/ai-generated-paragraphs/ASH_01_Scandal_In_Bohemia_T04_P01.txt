The rain finally stopped, leaving that clean, earthy smell that hangs over the fields here. I had a whole spreadsheet open on my laptop inside, a neat grid of pros and cons that screamed 'go back to the city'. Every cell was a perfectly rational point: career, money, convenience. But then I stepped out onto the damp porch, and the wind rustled through the tall grass in a way that sounded like a sigh. It was just a sound, nothing you could quantify or add to a column. And in that moment, the entire spreadsheet just felt… irrelevant. Silly, even. I knew, with a certainty that had nothing to do with data, that I was staying. Some decisions aren't made with your head; they're just recognized by your gut when the world gets quiet enough for you to listen.
