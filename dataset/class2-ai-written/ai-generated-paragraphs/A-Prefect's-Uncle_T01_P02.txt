You wanted a simple answer, didn't you? Some confession that I was reckless, that I didn't think it through. But I thought of nothing else. I carried that decision around for days, feeling its shape in my pocket, its weight in my stomach. Everyone was looking to me, waiting for an adult to show up, but there were no adults in that room. It was just me. Just me and the silence while the options narrowed down to two impossible paths. I was a child playing a game with no good moves, but I still had to play. So I chose. I acted. And I would do it again, because someone had to be the one to get their hands dirty, and everyone else was perfectly happy to let it be me.
