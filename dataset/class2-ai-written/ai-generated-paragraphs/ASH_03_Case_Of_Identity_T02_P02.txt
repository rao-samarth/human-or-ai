The silence in the car had grown heavy, thick with the dust kicked up from the desert road. Finally, you spoke, your voice low and brittle. “So that was the price.” I kept my eyes fixed on the endless horizon, on the shimmering heat that distorted the world into something unrecognizable. “It was an opportunity,” I corrected, gripping the steering wheel until my knuckles were white. “A way out.” You laughed, a short, ugly sound. “A way out for you. You sold everything we built, everything we were, for what? A number in an account? Was it worth it, liquidating a decade of trust for a better view from your new apartment?” I didn’t answer. The setting sun bled across the sky, painting everything in shades of orange and blood. For that kind of money, it was always worth it.
