I saw him again today, across the plaza where the pigeons and tourists fight for scraps. He was just standing there, pretending to look at the fountain, but I knew he was really watching me. It’s always been like this between us, a silent war fought in the margins of textbooks and over the shrill of the morning bell. He thinks he’s clever, getting that extra point on the physics quiz, but it was a fluke. A lucky guess. I’m the one who truly understands the material, the one who puts in the real work while the city screams outside my window. He just smiles that easy smile, like none of this matters, but it’s an act. He’s as obsessed as I am. He has to be. I’ll see him in calculus tomorrow, and he’ll see what real strategy looks like. He won't know what hit him.
