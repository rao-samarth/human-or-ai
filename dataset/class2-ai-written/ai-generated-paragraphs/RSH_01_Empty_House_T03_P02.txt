My uncle’s voice boomed across the dining room, a battering ram of certainty that left my cousin shrinking in his chair. He was lecturing again, his chest puffed out, laying out all the reasons my cousin’s small business idea was a fool’s errand, a pathetic dream destined to fail. Everyone else looked at their plates, avoiding the storm, but my sister watched him with a calm, unnerving stillness. When he finally paused for a triumphant breath, her voice, barely a whisper, sliced through the thick air. "But didn't you say the same thing about your own first company, right before it became a success?" The silence that followed was absolute. All the air went out of him, the righteous anger collapsing into a deflated, hollow surprise. He just stared at her, disarmed not by a shout, but by a memory he couldn't deny.
