No, of course I’m not surprised. Were you? You just have to look at the way they talked about him from the beginning—always "a pillar of the community," a "family man who made a regrettable error." An error. If you or I did something even half as bad, they’d call it a crime and we’d be ruined for life, our pictures plastered everywhere for a week. But for him, it’s a quiet settlement and a mandatory donation to some charity he probably owns anyway. The whole production, all those lawyers in their sharp suits and the somber-looking judge, it’s just theater to keep people like us believing the scales are actually balanced. He knew exactly how it would end before he even walked in the door. We all did. It's just that most people still want to pretend the game isn't rigged from the start.
