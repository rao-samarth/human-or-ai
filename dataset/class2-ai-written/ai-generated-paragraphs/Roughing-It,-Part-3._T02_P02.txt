The man across the table is recounting a story about a near-miss at a train station in a foreign city, gesticulating with a fork to emphasize the screech of the brakes. His audience is captivated, but I feel a profound sense of déjà vu, a cold certainty that I have lived this exact moment. I remember the scent of diesel and rain, the weight of the leather bag slipping from my shoulder. Yet, the memory has the polished edges of a well-told anecdote, the kind you read late at night when the world feels malleable. Did I absorb his history, or did he somehow steal mine from a dream? It's difficult to say. Everyone here is performing a version of themselves anyway, reciting lines they've practiced for years. I look down at my own hands on the white tablecloth, half-expecting to see someone else's.
