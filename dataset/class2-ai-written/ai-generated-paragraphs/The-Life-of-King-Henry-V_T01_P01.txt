The landscape blurs into a single, continuous green from the train window, a speed that feels both exhilarating and unnerving. People expect a steady hand on the controls, a clear vision of the destination. They don't see the momentary flicker of doubt in the engineer's eyes, the slight hesitation before a switch. The act of guiding others becomes a strange sort of theater. You must project an unwavering certainty you rarely feel, because their stability depends on your performance. Every decision is a quiet calculation of risks that others will never know, a private negotiation with potential failure. They see the arrival, the smooth glide into the station. They don't feel the constant, low-grade hum of responsibility for the entire journey, for every soul on board who placed their faith in a direction they can only hope is true.
