The old stone wall was a jumble of lichen-spotted granite, but one stone held my attention. A deep, smooth groove was carved into its face, a perfect arc polished into the rough surface. It wasn't the work of water; the pattern was too deliberate, too localized. The groove was low, about knee-height, right where the wildflowers grew thickest against the crumbling mortar. For a moment, I could almost see it: a heavy wooden gate that was once hinged here, its iron latch scraping this same path day after day, year after year. A farmer heading out to the fields at dawn, a child chasing a dog through the opening in the evening. The gate is gone now, rotted away to nothing. The people are gone too. All that remains is this unintentional monument, a cold, hard fact etched by a thousand forgotten gestures.
