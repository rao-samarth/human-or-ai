The clock on my phone says 2:17 AM, and all I can think about is the look on his face in history class. It wasn't smug, not really, just this quiet confidence that drives me nuts. Our entire high school experience has felt like this silent, unending race that only the two of us are running. It’s not like we’re enemies; we’ll nod in the hallway, maybe even work together on a group project without any drama. But underneath it all, there's this current. I know his GPA to the second decimal place, and I’m certain he knows mine. I spend hours trying to perfect an essay, wondering what kind of angle he’s taking on his. The rest of the house is completely still, and it just highlights how loud this one-sided conversation in my head really is. It’s exhausting, constantly measuring myself against a ghost who just happens to wear the same school uniform.
