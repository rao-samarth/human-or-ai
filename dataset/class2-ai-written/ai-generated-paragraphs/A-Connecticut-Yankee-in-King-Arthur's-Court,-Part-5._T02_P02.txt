The low stone wall was almost finished, each rock placed with a careful, sun-baked hand. Then the horns sounded, a sharp blast ripping through the valley’s peace. Hoofbeats followed, a rolling thunder that shook the ground. He looked up, his heart lurching. Riders. Cresting the hill, they were a blur of fine coats and gleaming horses, not following the path but cutting straight across the pasture, straight towards his small flock. He dropped his tools and sprinted, waving his arms, shouting into the wind as the sheep scattered. The lead horseman, a youth with a careless laugh, simply spurred his mount, clearing the half-built wall in a showy leap. The others followed, a cascade of pounding hooves and flying turf. They were gone as quickly as they came, leaving behind trampled earth, panicked animals, and the bitter dust of their passage. His day’s work undone for a moment of their sport.
