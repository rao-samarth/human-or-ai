The official email sat unopened, but the news was already out. David got the director role. I stared at my own monitor, the project plan blurring into a meaningless grid. For months, I’d been playing the game, staying late for the projects that looked good, forcing a smile in all the right meetings. All for nothing. The initial sting felt sharp and deeply unfair. But then my mind drifted to yesterday afternoon, when I spent nearly an hour with the new hire, untangling the convoluted reporting system for her. I remember the exact moment it clicked, that small sigh of relief she gave. That felt more significant and real than any budget I've ever balanced. It’s funny, that’s the one thing I never thought to mention in my performance reviews. Maybe this whole time I’ve been chasing a destination I never actually wanted to reach.
