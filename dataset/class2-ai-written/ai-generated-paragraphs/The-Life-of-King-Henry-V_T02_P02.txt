The banners and the soaring songs promised a righteous fire, a clean and noble purpose that would echo through generations. We believed them, of course. We marched to the sound of trumpets, our hearts full of grand ideas painted for us in bright colours. But the truth had no soundtrack. It was just the squelch of mud, the low drone of a distant engine, and the quiet, desperate hope for a sunrise that you might get to see. Now, sitting here where the only battle is between the wildflowers and the grass, I understand. The real triumph was never about the flags or the parades. It’s this. It is the profound, simple gift of a silent afternoon, the warmth of the sun on your skin, and the stubborn, beautiful persistence of life pushing up through the soil, utterly indifferent to the stories we once told.
