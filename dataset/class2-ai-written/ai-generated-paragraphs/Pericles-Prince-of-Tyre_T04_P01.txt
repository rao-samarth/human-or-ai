For six days, he had been a man incomplete, navigating his muddy patch of garden with one dry foot and one perpetually damp, sorrowful sock. The left Wellington boot was simply gone. He’d searched the hedgerow, peered into the compost bin, and even entertained the dark possibility that a particularly ambitious badger had dragged it underground for some unknowable badger purpose. It felt like a profound betrayal to even browse for new pairs online; this boot had history, a comfortable worn-in shape that knew the contours of his foot. Then, this morning, while sipping his tea and gazing mournfully out the kitchen window, he saw it. It was perched on his neighbor’s fence post, a bright red geranium now blooming cheerfully from its opening. The sheer, unapologetic audacity of it was breathtaking. He wasn't sure whether to feel righteous anger or profound relief, but mostly he just felt an overwhelming urge to march over and rescue his foot's other half from a life of floral decoration.
