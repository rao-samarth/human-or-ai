Amidst the clatter of forks and performative laughter, one can observe the subtlest forms of dominion. It is not in the raised voice or the overt command, but in the quiet glance across the table that halts a story mid-sentence, replacing it with a tight, apologetic smile. It is in the way one person’s opinion becomes the household’s established fact, not through debate, but through a slow, wearying process of attrition. This is a brand of power that leaves no visible marks, a cage built not of bars but of corrected memories, gentle dissuasions, and the suffocating weight of another’s expectations. To an outsider, it looks like harmony, a seamless partnership. Yet, within that placid surface, a sovereignty of the self is being methodically dismantled, a quiet surrender so complete that the captive may no longer even recognize the sound of their own untutored thoughts.
