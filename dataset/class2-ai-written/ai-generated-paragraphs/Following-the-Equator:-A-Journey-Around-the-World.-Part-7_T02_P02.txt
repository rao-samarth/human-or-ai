Standing on this corner, I’m caught in a human current that never seems to stop. Back home, a crowd this dense would hum with a low-grade tension, a silent, mutual agreement to guard one’s personal territory at all costs. An accidental bump would trigger an automatic, almost apologetic recoil from both sides. But here, it’s a completely different physics. People flow in a way that feels less like a collection of individuals and more like a single, fluid entity. Shoulders brush and elbows graze with a casual indifference that isn't rude, just practical. It’s not an invasion of space because the very concept of a personal bubble seems to have dissolved into the humid air. It’s a shared space in the truest sense, a chaotic but strangely graceful dance where no one is leading and everyone is simply part of the movement.
