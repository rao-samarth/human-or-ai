The phone call had ended minutes ago, but he remained on the park bench, the device heavy in his hand. Around him, the city churned on with its usual indifference: the distant wail of a siren, the rhythmic hiss of bus brakes, the murmur of a hundred conversations blending into a single, meaningless hum. He had expected elation, a sharp, bright feeling of triumph after all these years. Instead, a profound stillness settled in his chest, a quiet so deep it seemed to absorb all the surrounding noise. The verdict he had chased for a lifetime had finally arrived, but it landed without impact, a stone dropped into a dry well. The faces he had done this for were memories now, unable to share in the hollow victory. All that remained was the quiet ache of a duty fulfilled long after it could bring anyone back. He watched a taxi splash through a puddle, and for the first time in thirty years, wondered what he was supposed to do tomorrow.
