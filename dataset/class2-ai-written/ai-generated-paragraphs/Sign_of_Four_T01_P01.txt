My uncle leaned back in his chair, the crystal glass of wine swirling in his hand, and finished the story of his latest acquisition with a hearty laugh. Everyone at the table joined in, charmed by his narrative of cunning and victory. I felt a cold sickness in my stomach. I knew the other side of that deal; I knew the family he had "outmaneuvered," and they weren't just a competitor, they were broken. Just ten minutes ago, he’d casually offered to fund my entire graduate program, a life-changing sum I could never earn on my own. My mother caught my eye from across the table, her expression a placid mask, but her gaze was a clear command: stay quiet. I could taste the lie in the air, thick as the expensive cigar smoke. All I had to do was smile. Just nod along, accept the check, and pretend the foundation of my future wasn’t built on someone else’s ruin. My own silence felt like a price tag.
