You know, it’s wild how one person’s quiet envy can scorch your entire life. They just couldn't stand to see me have something good, I guess. It started with small things, these little poisoned whispers to our mutual friends, just enough to plant a seed of doubt. Then the stories got bigger and more twisted. The worst part wasn't even the initial lie, but watching them methodically turn everyone I cared about against me, twisting our shared history into weapons. In the end, it wasn’t just them I lost; it was my whole community, my entire support system, all gone up in smoke because of something they invented to make themselves feel better. That’s the thing nobody tells you—the real damage isn’t the broken friendship, it’s the permanent echo of mistrust it leaves behind in every new room you walk into.
