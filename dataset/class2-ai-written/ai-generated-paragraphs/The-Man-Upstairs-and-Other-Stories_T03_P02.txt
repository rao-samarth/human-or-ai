Of course, he’s over there talking to her. You can spot the ones who don’t really belong; it’s in the way they hold their champagne glass, a little too tightly, like a lifeline. Her dress is a rental, I’m almost certain—the color is just a shade too loud for a room like this. And that laugh. It cuts right through the low hum of actual conversation. He’s smiling, naturally, but it’s the kind of patient, indulgent smile one gives a child or a particularly charming pet. He’s just being kind, a small act of social charity before he moves on. He probably feels sorry for her. It’s a novelty, I suppose, a brief distraction from the people he’s actually meant to connect with tonight. He’ll get bored in a minute and come find me, once the amusement wears off. He always does.
