The light changed, and the crowd surged forward, a wave of umbrellas and impatient shoulders. My first instinct was to keep moving, to get home and shut the world out, the termination letter a damp weight in my pocket. But then I saw him. He was a young man, probably a student, sitting on the edge of a concrete planter with his head in his hands. His backpack was open, papers spilling out onto the wet pavement. Nobody paid him any mind; he was just another piece of city scenery. A year ago, I would have walked past. I would have felt a flicker of pity, perhaps, but my own urgent schedule would have won. Now, though, I couldn't ignore the familiar shape of his despair. I remembered the hollowed-out feeling of receiving bad news alone in public, the desperate need for the ground to simply swallow you whole. I knew that silence. My bus was coming, its brakes hissing at the corner, but I found myself walking toward him instead, not even sure what I would say.
