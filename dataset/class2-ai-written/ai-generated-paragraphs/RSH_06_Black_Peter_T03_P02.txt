The train crawled past the open-air market, a blur of color and noise pressed against the glass. My gaze snagged on two men, their faces tight with fury, screaming over a single, glinting bracelet someone had dropped in the dust. It couldn't have been worth much, just cheap metal and colored glass. But they fought for it as if it were the last ingot of gold on earth. The argument was a language of shoves and pointed fingers, a universal dialect of want. Then, a fist flew. A crack of bone against jaw. The crowd recoiled, a wave parting around their brutal little island of conflict. I watched, my chest tightening, and saw it wasn't about the trinket at all. It was about the crushing emptiness that made such a small, worthless thing feel like everything, a prize worth drawing blood for. It was the howl of a hungry soul, desperate to own just one more thing than the man standing next to him.
