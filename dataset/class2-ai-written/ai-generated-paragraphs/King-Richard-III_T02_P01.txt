The glowing screen of the laptop cast long shadows across the study. I was just looking for an old tax return, but what I found was something else entirely. It was all there in neat columns and encrypted folders: a slow, methodical siphoning of funds from the family business. My uncle. The man who taught me how to ride a bike, who always had a story and a twenty-dollar bill for my birthday. Everyone saw him as the bedrock of our family, the one you could always count on. But this digital trail painted a different picture, one of a cold calculator who had been betraying us for years. I could just close the laptop. Forget I ever saw it. Preserve the peace, the image we all cherished. Or I could bring everything crashing down with a single email, shattering not just our finances but the very idea of who we thought we were. The cursor blinked on the screen, a tiny, pulsing question mark, and the silence of the house felt heavier than ever.
