Julian set his wine glass down with a delicate click, the sound sharp in a brief lull of dinner conversation. “The problem, as I see it,” he announced, his voice carrying just enough to command the immediate vicinity, “is a fundamental failure to appreciate structural critique. You’re arguing from a place of pure anecdote.” He aimed a pointed look at his niece, Clara. She stopped mid-chew, her fork hovering over her plate. “It’s not an anecdote, Uncle Julian, it’s my life. It’s what actually happens.” He smiled, a thin, pitying expression. “But the lived experience of one person is merely data, not analysis. To truly understand the forces at play, one must elevate the discourse beyond the personal.” Clara dropped her fork with a clatter. “Elevate it where? To your book club? To some abstract, intellectual space where you can feel superior without ever getting your hands dirty? Your 'structural critique' is a luxury. My 'anecdote' is paying the bills.”
