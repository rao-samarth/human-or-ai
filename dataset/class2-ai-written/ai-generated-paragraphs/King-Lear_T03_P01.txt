It was two in the morning, and the battle for the Wi-Fi had entered its fourth hour, a silent, vicious siege conducted entirely through glowing screens from separate rooms. My mother, the instigator, had changed the password after a perceived slight involving the dishwasher. Now, my father was methodically working his way through every possible combination of our dog’s name and my mother’s birthday, muttering about psychological warfare. My sister, meanwhile, had adopted a scorched-earth policy, attempting to factory-reset the router from her phone, an act of digital treason that would plunge us all into a connectivity dark age. I sat on the stairs, a neutral observer in this domestic Hague Convention violation, watching the router’s little light blink. It was no longer a signal for the internet; it was a tiny, pulsing white flag that nobody was willing to accept. We hadn't spoken a word to each other since dinner.
