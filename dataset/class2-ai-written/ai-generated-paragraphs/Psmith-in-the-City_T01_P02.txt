The morning procession moves with a practiced, almost silent rhythm. Below the towering glass and steel, thousands of individuals merge into a single, predictable current flowing from the subway stations toward the office lobbies. Each person carries an identical uniform of quiet professionalism—the same neutral-colored coats, the same leather bags, the same focused-yet-vacant expression. It is a daily shedding of self, a necessary subtraction performed at the building’s revolving doors. Inside, personality is flattened into productivity, and unique thoughts are molded to fit the clean lines of a spreadsheet. The city's hum is the background music to this collective transaction, where hours are exchanged for currency, and the most vibrant parts of a person are carefully packed away, saved for a life that seems to begin only after five o'clock. Tomorrow, the current will flow again, indistinguishable from today.
