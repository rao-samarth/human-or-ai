We passed the lone skeletal tree just as the sun reached its highest, most unforgiving point. Dangling from a thick, splintered branch were not one but three hats, bleached by the elements and swaying in the faint, hot wind. They were simple, dusty things, the kind any traveler or worker might wear. There was no sign, no body, no indication of what had happened, yet the message was perfectly clear. This was a place where quarrels were settled without words, where justice was delivered swiftly and left to be baked into the hardpan earth. No court had convened here, no judge had weighed the evidence. There was only the silent accusation of the hats, turning gently as if in a slow, final argument, before the vast, indifferent emptiness of the plains swallowed the story whole. We just kept moving, pretending we hadn’t understood.
