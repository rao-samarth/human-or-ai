You built a house of mirrors around us, and for the longest time, all I saw were warped reflections. Me, too small. You, impossibly large. Us, cracked down the middle. I started to believe that was the truth, that the distortion was all we were ever going to be. But I found a stone, a tiny piece of reality you couldn't polish away, and I threw it. The sound of the first shatter was the most honest thing I’d heard in years. Now, light is pouring in, and I can see the real you standing there, blinking in the sudden brightness, maybe just as lost as I was. Let’s sweep up the glass. We can walk out of this place together and find out what we look like under a clear, open sky.
