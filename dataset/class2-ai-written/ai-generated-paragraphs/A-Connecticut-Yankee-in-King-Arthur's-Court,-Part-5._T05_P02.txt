It’s the paperwork that’s most unsettling, really. Not the overt violence, which is horrific enough, but the calm, meticulous accounting of it all. You see these ledgers where human beings are listed next to bushels of cotton and heads of cattle, all part of the same inventory. They were quantified as assets, their value fluctuating with age and physical condition, calculated for depreciation over time. A person could be mortgaged, used as collateral to secure a loan for a new piece of farm equipment. Their children weren't recorded as a family, but as a net increase in capital stock. The entire legal and economic framework was engineered to strip away everything but their function. It's the cold, rational language of commerce applied to a human soul, reducing it to a line item that could be bought, sold, or inherited.
