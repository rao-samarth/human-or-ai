My finger hovered over the "Update" button. The script was loaded, a simple, elegant piece of code cooked up by the three of us in the junior developer pool. Once executed, it would systematically change the company’s internal server greeting from the CEO's self-important "Drive Synergy Forward!" to "Howdy Pardner!" for exactly one hour. It was a harmless, technically impressive prank aimed squarely at a man who once wrote someone up for using an exclamation point. But as I was about to click, I saw him walking the floor. He wasn't booming into his phone or scowling at spreadsheets; he was listening intently to one of the senior accountants, nodding with a look of genuine concern. For a fleeting moment, the corporate caricature we all mocked vanished, replaced by a person just trying to manage an impossible job. The prank suddenly felt less like a clever bit of insubordination and more like a childish, mean-spirited joke. Was our little laugh worth undermining him, even for an hour? The cursor blinked, waiting.
