You always talked about how peaceful it is out here, and from the porch, I can see why you’d think that. The fields stretch out in these neat, impossible green rectangles, and the lake this morning is so still it looks like you could just walk across its glassy surface. It’s the perfect picture of tranquility, the kind of deep quiet that seems to settle everything down inside you. But when you get closer, it’s a different story. I walked through those fields yesterday and saw the churned-up soil and the endless, silent fight against weeds. And if you stare at that lake long enough, you start to see the frantic world just beneath the top—the darting fish, the decaying leaves, the whole messy business of survival. It’s funny how the most serene-looking places are often just a thin cover over the most complicated activity.
