You’re still listening for logic, and that’s your mistake. He isn't building an argument; he's composing a hymn. He offers them simple, resonant words that feel like ancient truths, even if they were invented yesterday. The goal is never to persuade the individual mind, which is too stubborn and full of questions. The goal is to dissolve the individual into the crowd, to replace personal doubt with a shared, roaring certainty. He gives their anxieties a name and their anger a target. Once that’s done, the details don’t matter, because the feeling has become its own proof. He’s not selling them an idea. He’s selling them the feeling of belonging to something righteous and powerful, and for that feeling, people will gladly trade their reason without a second thought.
