I wonder how many times my boots have trod this exact same line in the dirt. It’s a groove worn deep by my own habits, and perhaps by others before me. I could, at any moment, veer off into the tall grass, making my own way. Nothing is stopping me. Yet I don't. I just keep following the curve of the hill, my eyes fixed on the distant copse of trees as if pulled by an invisible string. Every step feels like a choice, a conscious decision to place one foot after the other, but when I look back, the path seems so singular, so inevitable. It's as if I was always going to end up right here, watching the last light fade from this precise spot, wondering if I ever truly chose any of it.
