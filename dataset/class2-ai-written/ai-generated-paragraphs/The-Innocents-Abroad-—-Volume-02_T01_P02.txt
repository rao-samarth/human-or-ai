You always painted such a perfect picture of this life, remember? We’d talk for hours about long afternoons with a book on the porch, the only sound being a gentle breeze through the trees. The reality is a little different, and a lot louder. The quiet I imagined isn't really quiet; it’s filled with the incessant drone of a distant tractor that never seems to stop, and the wind is often a relentless, howling thing that rattles the window frames. That idyllic view from the kitchen window includes a perpetually muddy patch by the gate and a fence that’s slowly surrendering to gravity. I thought I was trading complexity for peace, but I see now I’ve just swapped one set of problems for another. It’s not the serene escape from the brochures, but it's something real, I suppose, with its own stubborn and unglamorous rhythm.
