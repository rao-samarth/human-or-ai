A place for kids to do their homework after school? The water took your inventory, sure. But look around.” She gestured to the bare walls, the open floor. “It also gave you a blank slate. All those people who showed up with mops and fans weren’t just trying to save your bookstore, Leo. They were trying to save their gathering place.”
