Oh, you want to give them *hope*? How wonderfully novel. Please, tell me more about how this time will be different. Every few years, someone with your bleeding heart and bottomless purse decides the rabble just needs a little encouragement—a few more crumbs from the feast, a shiny new program to teach them the "dignity of work." They don't want dignity; they want the entire banquet hall. And we keep them from it not with walls, but with illusions. We dangle the idea that one of them, just one, might make it to our side. We call it opportunity. They call it a lottery. As long as they're busy scratching their tickets and praying for a miracle, they aren't sharpening their knives. So go on, fund your little projects. It's just another ticket we're selling them, and frankly, it keeps things quiet for a season.
