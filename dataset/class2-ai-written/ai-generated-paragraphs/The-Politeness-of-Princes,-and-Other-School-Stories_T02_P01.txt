I’m sitting here with my coffee, and I can’t help but overhear the woman at the next table. “Just tell your teacher who took it,” she’s telling her son, all calm and reasonable. My whole body cringes. It’s the right thing to say, the sensible, adult thing. But a ghost of my younger self, the one with scuffed knees and a permanent suspicion of authority, just recoils. We had a code back then, didn't we? It was never spoken, never written on a classroom wall, but it was absolute. You didn’t tell. You just didn’t. You’d take the blame for a friend, you’d face the bully yourself after school, you’d even lie to protect an enemy from a teacher's wrath, because the alternative was unthinkable. Breaking that one rule made you a pariah, someone who didn't understand the real world, the one that operated in the yard when the grown-ups weren’t looking. That woman is giving her son good advice, but she’s teaching him to break the only law that ever really mattered.
