The old oak had stood on that hill for centuries, a twisted silhouette against the sky. Its bark was a roadmap of hardship, scarred by lightning and carved with the initials of forgotten lovers. It had endured droughts that cracked the very earth around its roots and gales that had ripped away its mightiest limbs. Its life was a long, silent war against the elements. The final storm was no different, just more decisive. A single, blinding flash, and the ancient trunk was split open, its core exposed to the rain. But now, in the quiet aftermath, sunlight dapples the wreckage. Mosses are already greening the splintered wood, and a community of beetles has moved into the hollowed-out heartwood. Around its fallen form, a ring of new saplings pushes through the enriched soil, reaching for the same light. The violent conclusion of its long struggle has become a cradle, a quiet promise that even the harshest ending can nurture a gentle beginning.
