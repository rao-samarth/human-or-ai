You promised us a story of endless light and perfect peace, didn't you? A forever-Sunday-morning where nothing ever goes wrong. But I've been thinking about it, really thinking. What is a mind without a problem to solve? What is a heart without a single ache to overcome? It’s just… static. A beautiful, shimmering, empty hum. You described a reward, but it sounds more like a sentence. All our fire, all our fight, all the messy, contradictory things that made us *us*, just smoothed over and polished into a featureless eternity. I don't want your placid heaven. I think the real prize was the grit we had all along, the struggle itself. Maybe that was the whole point, and you just dressed it up in gold to make it sell better.
