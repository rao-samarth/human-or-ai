The train slid through another town I’ll never know the name of, the houses blurring into green. On the platform, a couple of boys in blazers were shoving each other, and for a second, I was right back there. I remembered the time the science lab window got shattered by a poorly aimed ball. We all knew exactly who did it. But when the headmaster had us all lined up in the hall, his voice echoing as he demanded a name, the silence was absolute. It wasn't a decision; it was an instinct. You just didn’t talk. Eventually, a different kid entirely—one who wasn’t even there—stepped forward and took the blame, just because the real culprit was already on his final warning. That was the real law, more powerful than any school rule. Betraying it was a kind of social death, far worse than any punishment the teachers could dream up.
