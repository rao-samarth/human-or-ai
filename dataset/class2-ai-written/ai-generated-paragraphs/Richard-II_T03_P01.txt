From this hillside, you can see how the land has been tended, or rather, untended. There are plots choked with aggressive growth, where anything useful has long been strangled out, and other patches lie barren, their soil exhausted from bearing the same crop for too long without replenishment. It’s clear the caretakers lack a coherent plan, or perhaps they’ve simply lost interest, focusing their efforts on a few ornamental flowerbeds near the main gate while the foundations of the old stone walls crumble. One wonders if they even remember what the original design was meant to yield. This isn't wildness, which possesses its own fierce and impartial logic. This is the sadder state of abandonment, a design half-realized and then left to the whims of blight and decay, where the most vital saplings are starved of light.
