It’s hilarious, really, watching them all scurry through the gridlocked streets, each performing their designated role in the great urban play. You can almost see the invisible lines they’ve drawn between themselves, a complex map of perceived importance. The man in the thousand-dollar suit gets the doorman's obsequious bow, as if the sheer cost of his fabric has somehow imbued him with a soul worth acknowledging. Meanwhile, the woman delivering his lunch is practically transparent, a ghost in a uniform, despite the fact she’s likely the one keeping the whole operation from collapsing. They’ve all tacitly agreed to this bizarre choreography of deference and dismissal, all based on the brand of your watch or the zip code on your mail. It's the city's most pathetic, long-running joke: a silent, collective agreement to pretend that some humans are just inherently better than others, and the punchline is that everyone is desperate to be the one telling it.
