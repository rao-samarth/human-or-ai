Sarah motioned toward the chair in front of her desk, but Mark remained standing, his shoulders tight. He’d been expecting this meeting all week. “We got the final report back from the external audit,” she began, her voice quiet. “The data breach… it wasn’t from your development branch. It turns out there was a vulnerability in a third-party encryption library we’ve used for years. A ghost in the machine, completely unrelated to your work.” Mark just stared at her, the words not quite landing. He’d spent weeks under a cloud of suspicion, his every move scrutinized. “They found the entry point,” she continued, sliding a folder across the desk. “It’s all in here. You’re completely cleared, Mark.” He finally let out a breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding. “So it’s over?” he asked, his voice rough. Sarah nodded. “It’s over. And for what it’s worth, I am sorry we put you through that.”
