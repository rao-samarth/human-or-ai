The forest floor was damp under my running shoes, the air thick with the smell of pine. Just another half-mile and the trophy was ours, the culmination of a year of Gold House fighting for every single point. Then I saw him. A flash of crimson against the green ferns. He was their best runner, slumped against an old oak with his face pale and his ankle twisted at an impossible angle. I could just run past. No one would know, and we would finally win after years of coming in second. But the woods were suddenly silent, and he made a small sound, a whimper that cut through my ambition. He was the enemy, the one we’d sworn to beat. To stop meant certain defeat for my house, a failure I’d have to carry all year. To continue felt like a different kind of loss, one that would weigh far more than any silver cup.
