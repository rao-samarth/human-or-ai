He truly believed it was all forgotten, a story buried by decades of his own success. "You always thought you were the exception," I said, my voice low but carrying over the untouched plates. "That the rules were for other people. You built this life, this beautiful house, on a foundation of pure rot, thinking that if you just piled enough money on top, no one would ever notice the smell. But the world has a long memory. It keeps a perfect ledger, and the ink never, ever fades. It just waits. It watches you climb higher and higher, and it waits for the fall. The bill always comes due. Always. And tonight, the interest is just staggering."
