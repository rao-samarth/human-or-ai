I still think about that quarterly review, the one where the air was thick with a kind of polite fear as the director outlined a plan we all knew was a disaster. Then he spoke. His voice was even and low, but it landed in the silent room like a dropped stone. He didn't do it for glory; he calmly dismantled the flawed logic to save a project he believed in and to shield the junior staff from the inevitable fallout. Afterward, a subtle chill followed him through the hallways, and colleagues suddenly found the floor fascinating when he passed. For me, though, something shifted irrevocably. It wasn't a grand romantic moment, but a quiet recognition of a backbone I hadn't known existed, a solitary act of integrity in a place that rewarded the opposite. I saw him packing his desk that evening and just went to make him a coffee, knowing it was a hopelessly inadequate gesture.
