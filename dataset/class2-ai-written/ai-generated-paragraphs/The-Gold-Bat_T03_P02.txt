The only sounds were the hum of the refrigerator and the steady drumming of rain against the glass. In these quiet hours, it becomes clear that some commitments are not a matter of choice or rational calculation. They exist as a fundamental state, like the floor beneath your feet. When a foundation cracks and the entire structure of a life threatens to collapse, there are those who run for safety and those who simply remain. This second group isn't necessarily braver; their presence is just an immutable fact of the situation. They don't weigh the risks or consider the alternatives. They are simply there, a constant element in the chaos, not to fix the problem, but to ensure the other person doesn't face the wreckage alone. It is a quiet, stubborn refusal to abandon a post, an anchor that was dropped long before the storm ever arrived.
