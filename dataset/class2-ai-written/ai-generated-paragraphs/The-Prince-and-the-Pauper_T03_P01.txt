You think I wanted this for you? You look at me like I’m some kind of monster, but you don't get it. You just don't. People who have never been properly broken are useless; they’re just smooth, polished stones, pretty but incapable of feeling anything for anyone else. They just skip along the surface. Real kindness, the kind that actually matters, isn't grown in some sunny garden. It’s pieced together from the wreckage. You have to know what the floor feels like before you can properly help someone else up. I gave you that. It might feel like a wound now, but it was a gift. One day you’ll see someone else’s pain and you won’t just pity it—you’ll understand it, right down to the bone. That’s what I did for you.
