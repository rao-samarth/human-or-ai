Look, I can't explain why I have this little brass bell on the counter. They gave one to all of us. On Fridays, at exactly 4:49 PM, one minute before we can leave, an email goes out with the subject line 'Triumph.' We're all supposed to ring the bell. Just once. Everyone on the video call holds their little bell up to the camera and you hear this faint, tinny, asynchronous chaos for about five seconds. Nobody ever smiles. It’s just this thing we do, this required celebration. I brought it home because I felt like if I left it on my desk, I’d be breaking some unwritten rule, a rule somehow more important than any of the ones in the actual employee handbook. It feels heavier than it looks.
