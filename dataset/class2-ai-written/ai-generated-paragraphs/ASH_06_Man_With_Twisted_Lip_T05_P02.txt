My uncle, holding a half-eaten burger, mentioned again how he struggled to find good help for his business, shaking his head at what he called a 'lack of ambition these days.' A familiar silence settled over the picnic table, the kind that precedes a polite change of subject. But my younger cousin, who was working two jobs just to cover her student loans, didn't let it drop. She just smiled and started talking about the people she worked with. She described the single mom on her morning shift who was taking online classes to become a nurse, and the quiet guy from the weekend crew who spent his free nights building the most beautiful custom furniture in his garage. The conversation slowly changed. We weren't talking about what people lacked anymore; we were talking about what they were building. It was amazing how quickly the air cleared, and Uncle Mark even asked for the furniture guy’s website.
