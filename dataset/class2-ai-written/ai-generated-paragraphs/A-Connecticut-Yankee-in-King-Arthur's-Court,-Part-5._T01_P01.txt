So you drew your little sigils on the cave wall and your shaman chanted until he was hoarse. Charming. Truly. While you were busy listening for whispers on the wind, we were listening to your heartbeats from five klicks away. You tried to divine our movements by reading smoke; we just ran your historical patrol routes through a predictive algorithm. It’s a shame, really. All that earnest belief, all that tradition. Your greatest warding spell, the one your ancestors supposedly died for, didn’t even register as a mild energy fluctuation before the kinetic strike leveled the entire camp. So please, spare me the lecture on 'ancient power.' It’s just noise that hasn’t met the right frequency to cancel it out yet.
