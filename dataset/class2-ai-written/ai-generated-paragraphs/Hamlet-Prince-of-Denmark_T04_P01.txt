For weeks, the project plan had become a fortress of its own making. We had circled the same whiteboard, adding more flowcharts and risk assessments until the original goal was buried under endless speculation. Every potential move was so thoroughly analyzed that it became impossibly heavy, too fraught with imagined consequences to actually attempt. We were architects of a perfect future that we were too afraid to start building. Then, this morning, someone quietly erased a small corner of the board. "What if we just build this one tiny piece?" they asked. "Not the whole system, just this. It might be wrong, but we'll learn more from a flawed attempt than from another perfect meeting." A strange, liberating silence filled the room. We suddenly saw that we didn't need a flawless map for the entire journey; we just needed the courage to take the first step and trust that the path would appear as we walked.
