I was sitting in that little coffee shop by the station, just trying to get some work done, when I started tuning in to the two men at the table next to me. They must have been in their fifties, laughing loudly about some incident from their school days. One was describing how they’d accidentally smashed a chemistry lab beaker and the teacher was furious, absolutely ready to suspend someone. And the other one just nodded, a huge grin on his face, and said, 'You looked at me, I looked at you, and that was it. We both owned up.' No discussion. No panic. Just this immediate, unspoken agreement that whatever was coming, they were going to face it as a single unit. It struck me listening to them that it wasn’t even about the trouble they got into; it was about the pact itself. That quiet, powerful decision made in a split second between two kids in oversized blazers was clearly still the bedrock of their friendship all these years later. It’s a funny kind of loyalty, forged in chalk dust and the fear of detention.
