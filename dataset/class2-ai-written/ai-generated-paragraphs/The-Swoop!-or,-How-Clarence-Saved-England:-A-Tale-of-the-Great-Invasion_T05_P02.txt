The old man from the cottage at the end of the lane was a figure of quiet speculation, mostly known for his prize-winning dahlias and his tendency to ignore friendly waves.

People shouted, someone fumbled with a phone, but the volunteer fire truck was a good ten minutes away. Then he was there, a shovel in his gnarled hands, his face grimed with dirt. He didn't speak a word. With a lifetime's understanding of the soil, he began digging, carving a frantic, dark line in the parched earth, a desperate trench to starve the approaching flames. He worked with a furious, rhythmic economy of motion, a silent, solitary force against the encroaching chaos.
