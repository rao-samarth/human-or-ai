I understand why you’re all looking at me this way. It started small, just watching these videos during my lunch break. Everyone was showing off new cars, paying off their parents' mortgages, all from this one simple "system." They made it seem so achievable, like I was a fool for not getting in on it. The endless spreadsheets, the quarterly reports… they all started to feel like a cage. This was my key. I convinced myself it was a sure thing, a calculated risk that would finally get me out from under everything. So yes, I moved the funds. It was only supposed to be for a few days, just until the market turned. Then it didn't. The whole thing just evaporated overnight, and so did my life savings. Now I just see the truth: there was no system, no secret. There was just me, a login screen, and a very expensive dream.
