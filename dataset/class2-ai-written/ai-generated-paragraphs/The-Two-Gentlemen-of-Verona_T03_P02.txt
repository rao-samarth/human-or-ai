The whispers started last Tuesday, the kind that cling to the air in a town this small, heavy and sweet like overripe honeysuckle. They said he was with her down by the old mill, the one place we always said was ours. I saw the way people looked at me in the grocery store, a mix of pity and morbid curiosity. And yes, for a moment, my world felt like it had been knocked clean off its axis. He came home that night, smelling of cheap perfume and river water, his eyes pleading before he even opened his mouth. But what was I supposed to do? To hold onto anger here is like trying to hold onto smoke. So I told him it was fine. I made him coffee, we watched some dumb show, and by morning, the whole thing felt like a bad dream someone else had. He’s a good man, mostly. Everyone makes a mistake.
