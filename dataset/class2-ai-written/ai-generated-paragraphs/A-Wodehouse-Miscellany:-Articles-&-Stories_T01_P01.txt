My uncle was lamenting the abysmal state of the sommelier service on his last flight to Monaco, while my aunt worried aloud that her new puppy’s aura was “distinctly beige.” The air grew thick with these beautifully crafted, weightless problems, each one a delicate bubble of concern. I almost got lost in it, until I looked out at the garden where my little niece and the neighbor's boy, both covered in grass stains, were conducting a funeral for a beetle. They treated the ceremony with such solemn, heartfelt gravity, a stark contrast to the performative anxieties inside. Watching them, I felt a surge of warmth. They were still connected to what was real, to the big, small dramas of life and death playing out in the lawn. And I realized, with a quiet joy, that maybe that powerful, simple connection wasn't something you could ever truly outgrow.
