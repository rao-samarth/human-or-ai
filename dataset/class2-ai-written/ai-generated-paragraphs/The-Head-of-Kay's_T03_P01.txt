I’m not sure you understand the gravity of this situation,” Martin said, pinching the bridge of his nose. He stared at his new assistant, whose eyes were wide with a very unhelpful mixture of fear and eagerness. “Everything hinges on this. I need you to go down to the loading bay and meet the delivery. Just tell them you’re here for the big one, and make sure it’s handled with extreme care.” The assistant, Leo, nodded so vigorously his head seemed to wobble. “The big one. Extreme care. Got it.” Ten minutes of excruciating silence passed before Leo reappeared, sweating but triumphant, followed by two burly delivery men carefully maneuvering a massive, seven-foot-tall inflatable cactus. Martin stared blankly at the garish green object now occupying most of his office doorway. He had, of course, been referring to the new server rack, nicknamed “Big Bertha” by the IT department.
