I just don’t know how we get out of this. Seriously. We keep talking about an exit strategy, like it’s a burning building, but then one of us just stands there, mesmerized by the flames. Every single time we try to pull away, we just create a bigger, more complicated knot to untangle later. I’m so tired of the damage control, the whispered phone calls, the carefully constructed stories for everyone else. It feels like we're just collecting wreckage at this point, piling it up until neither of us can see the sky anymore. And for what? For these tiny moments that feel good before the whole thing collapses on us again? It’s not sustainable. I think we both know that, but I’m the only one willing to say it out loud.
