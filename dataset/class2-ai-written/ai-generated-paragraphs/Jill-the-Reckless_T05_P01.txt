I’ve spent years thinking I had my uncle figured out. At every family gathering, he’s the same: a quiet fixture in the corner armchair, observing the chaos with a neutral, almost stern expression that I always read as disapproval. He doesn't join the loud storytelling or the boisterous card games. But yesterday, I slipped into the den to escape the noise and saw him with my youngest niece. She was struggling with a new video game, and he had knelt down beside her, his large frame awkward on the floor. He wasn't talking much, but he was patiently pointing at the screen, his face softened by a concentration that looked a lot like care. It struck me then that I’d mistaken his quietness for coldness. I'd built a whole personality for him based on a few surface details, never considering that his way of connecting was just different—less about words and more about a shared, quiet focus.
