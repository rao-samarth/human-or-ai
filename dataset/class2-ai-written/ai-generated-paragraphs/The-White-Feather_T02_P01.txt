I learned pretty quickly that in this city, the first question isn’t always about what you do, but where you went to school. Not college, but high school. It’s the ultimate shorthand. The other night at some crowded rooftop party, a guy I'd just met asked the inevitable, and the moment I said the name, I saw it—that little flicker in his eyes. He was instantly sorting me into a box, complete with a pre-written biography based on a building I haven’t stepped inside for over a decade. It's this strange, invisible brand that follows you from your teenage years, a ghost trailing you onto the subway and into job interviews. You can spend years building an entirely new life, a different identity, but for some people here, you’ll always just be a kid from *that* school, and they think they know your whole story.
