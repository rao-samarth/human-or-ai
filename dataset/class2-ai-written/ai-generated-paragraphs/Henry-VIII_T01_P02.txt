The old boundary wall is more of a suggestion than a command these days. Stones that were once hauled and set with immense effort to declare the reach of a single family now lie scattered in the long grass, providing shelter for field mice and a perch for robins. The name that once held sway over every field and stream in this valley has faded, becoming just another layer in the local history, less real than the wind that moves through the ash trees. And yet, there is no sense of loss here, only of change. A young oak, stubborn and green, has forced its way through a fissure in the foundation, its roots slowly and patiently dismantling what human ambition built. It’s a quiet reminder that what seems permanent is often just temporary, and that when great structures fall, they don’t leave a vacuum but instead make room for new, more resilient life to take hold and reach for the sun.
