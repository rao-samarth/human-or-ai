Oh, I love listening to people debate the merits of a “just” outcome versus a “merciful” one. It’s such a wonderfully pointless performance. Justice, as they call it, is just sanitized revenge; it’s cosmic score-keeping for people who need to believe the universe has a tidy little ledger. It doesn’t fix the damage, it just balances the books in a way that satisfies our most primitive instincts. And mercy? Please. That’s just arbitrary luck. It’s a pardon granted not by some higher grace, but by a committee, a whim, or a well-timed public relations campaign. It’s the ultimate loophole. So you’re left choosing between cold, satisfying arithmetic and a lottery ticket for absolution, and we all pretend this is some profound moral dilemma. It’s hilarious, really.
