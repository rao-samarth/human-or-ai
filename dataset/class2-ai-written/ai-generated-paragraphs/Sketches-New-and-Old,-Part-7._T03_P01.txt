The tour bus rattled along the coastal road, and the man in the seat ahead of me was holding court, his voice a low, insistent hum of academic jargon. He wasn't just looking at the olive groves; he was “interrogating the agrarian semiotics of the landscape.” A crumbling farmhouse wasn't a sad, empty building, but an “ontological void articulating the inherent dialectic between human endeavor and entropic decay.” He gestured with a soft, unblemished hand, explaining to his silent, nodding wife how the whole vista represented a “post-capitalist liminality.” I just wanted to see the pretty hills. Apparently, that was a failure of my own critical paradigm. Or something. I’d stopped listening, preferring to focus on the much more profound existential statement being made by a goat chewing on a plastic bag by the side of the road.
