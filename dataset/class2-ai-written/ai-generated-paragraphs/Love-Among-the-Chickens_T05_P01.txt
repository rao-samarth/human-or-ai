Oh, you will not believe the man I was just stuck behind at the grocery store. He was at the self-checkout, locked in a mortal battle with a single banana. The machine kept shouting ‘unexpected item in the bagging area’ and he’d just stare at it, completely baffled, as if the concept of gravity had just been introduced to him. An employee, who looked about sixteen and deeply tired of life, came over to help. She fixes it, and what does he do? He immediately starts scanning the same banana again. And again. By the fourth scan, the woman behind me let out this little snort. The grand finale was him trying to jam his credit card into the receipt printer slot. We all just shared this silent, collective look of awe. Honestly, I almost offered him a round of applause.
