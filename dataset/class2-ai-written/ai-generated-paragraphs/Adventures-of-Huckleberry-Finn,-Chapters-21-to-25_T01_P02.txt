Honestly, I never said the stone warmed itself. I just remarked that it felt less cold than the others on a chilly morning, a simple observation anyone could make. But then old Mr. Henderson, with his bad hearing, told his wife it was a 'blessed' rock, and the whole thing ran away from me. Suddenly, people were leaving little offerings—a piece of fruit, a painted pebble, a ribbon tied to the fence post above it. They’d press their hands to it and close their eyes, whispering hopes for a good harvest or a mended heart. I tried to correct the story once, just once, at the market. The look they gave me, you would have thought I’d spat on the flag. They didn't want the truth; they wanted the miracle. They preferred a magical explanation to simple morning sun on dark slate.
