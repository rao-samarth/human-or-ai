You saw the perfect life, didn't you? Everyone did. The carefully arranged furniture, the smiles that were always ready for a photograph, the calm voice I used when things were falling apart. It was a beautiful structure, and I was its devoted architect, building it piece by piece just for an audience. But you never thought to check the foundation, did you? You never knocked on the walls to see if they were hollow. Behind that flawless paint, there was only rot and shoddy patchwork, a desperate scramble to keep the facade from collapsing inward. I let you admire the view from the street because I knew if you ever stepped inside, you’d see the whole thing was nothing more than an elaborate, fragile lie. It wasn't real. And I was so tired of holding it all up, pretending the floor wasn't about to give way beneath us both.
