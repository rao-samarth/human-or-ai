I suppose the only real crime was one of performance. Seated here, watching the dusty towns slip by the window, I feel the weight of the lie in the crispness of my shirt, a garment I could never have afforded a week ago. The man across the aisle, with his dismissive glance and expensive leather bag, accepted my presence without question because I played the part. I used the right words, held the fork correctly, and feigned a bored familiarity with places I’ve only read about. He has no idea that the only thing separating me from the woman selling fruit on the last platform is a few yards of starched cotton and a carefully rehearsed accent. It’s a fragile deception. One wrong move, one lapse in the act, and the entire flimsy structure that places me in this seat and her on that platform would instantly dissolve.
