It’s funny, the things you do. You’ll learn the entire history of a niche board game, rearrange your schedule based on a single cryptic emoji, and convince yourself that you suddenly love hiking uphill in the rain. We build these intricate, wobbly towers of shared interests and fated encounters, all while desperately trying to look like we just casually strolled into the situation. It’s a full-on, unscripted comedy of errors where you’re both the star and the stagehand tripping over the props. And yet, sitting here in the quiet glow of my phone, I wouldn't trade the clumsy, ridiculous dance for anything. There’s a strange, brilliant optimism in believing that somewhere out there is another person whose brand of nonsense perfectly complements your own, waiting for the curtain to rise.
