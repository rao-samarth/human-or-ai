The train rocked gently through the grey morning. Across the aisle, a couple was dissecting a film they had seen. He spoke of its 'liminal narrative architecture' and the 'abnegation of traditional catharsis.' She nodded, her voice low, adding a thought about the 'phenomenological weight of its visual grammar.' I watched the rain-streaked fields slide past and wondered if they simply meant the film was sad. It felt like they were describing a blueprint, not a feeling. They used words as a buffer, a complex and polished shield to hold between themselves and a genuine, messy emotion. Their shared vocabulary was a fortress with no one inside, and the silence it created was louder than any of their intricate pronouncements.
