Are you still up? I’m sitting here in the dark, and the house just made that weird groaning sound it does, which somehow made me think of our grand plan for Operation Sugar Heist. Remember the blueprint we drew on that napkin? It involved three walkie-talkies, a very confused golden retriever meant to be the diversion, and that intricate pulley system we rigged with fishing line and a paperclip to lower the cookie jar lid without a sound. Your job was the cough-based signal from the hallway, timed to the exact second the kitchen clock chimed midnight. It was a masterpiece of pointless complexity, a beautiful, sprawling mess of an idea built for the sole purpose of stealing two oatmeal raisin cookies. I can't for the life of me remember if it actually worked—I think the dog just ended up eating the decoy biscuit and falling asleep—but I do remember us hiding under the stairs, barely able to breathe from laughing so hard.
