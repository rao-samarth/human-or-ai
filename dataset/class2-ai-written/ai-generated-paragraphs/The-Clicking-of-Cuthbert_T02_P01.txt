It was in those shared observations, I think, that we built something fragile and unnamed, a recognition that we noticed the same quiet details in a world that rarely slowed down to look. Now he was just another colleague packing a cardboard box, and the silence that filled the space between us felt heavier than any of a thousand words we never said.
