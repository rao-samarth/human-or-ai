Stuck on this train somewhere between Vienna and Prague, you’d think the main topic of conversation would be the gothic spires or the price of goulash. But no. The two guys across the aisle are practically vibrating, their entire universe condensed into the glowing rectangles in their hands. They're not talking, they're incanting—muttering about 'support levels' and a 'guaranteed ten-bagger' on some digital tulip bulb I’ve never heard of. It’s a magnificent display of human ambition, really. Here we are, hurtling through the heart of old Europe, and their grand tour is a frantic F5-key pilgrimage to a mythical land called 'Early Retirement'. They speak of the future with the unshakeable certainty of prophets, completely oblivious to the fact that they’re just lemmings with Wi-Fi, excitedly discussing the view on their way to the cliff.
