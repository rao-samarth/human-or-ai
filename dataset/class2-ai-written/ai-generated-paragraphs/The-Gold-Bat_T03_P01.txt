After his family’s hardware store went under, you could feel the shift in town. People who’d known him his whole life suddenly found the pavement on the other side of the street fascinating whenever he walked by. The whispers in the diner got a little louder, a little meaner. They needed someone to blame for the boarded-up storefront on Main, and he was the easiest target. But every Friday evening, I still pulled my truck into his driveway, same as always. We didn’t talk about it much. We’d just sit on the porch, listen to the crickets, and watch the sun go down. He never had to ask if I was coming, and I never considered not showing up. Some things aren’t conditional. You just hold fast, and you wait for the storm to pass, together.
