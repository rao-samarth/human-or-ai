It’s funny how much energy we put into the presentation. We spend so much time constructing these carefully edited versions of our lives, especially for public consumption. You see it everywhere. It’s like every person is the curator of their own tiny, pristine museum. They select only the best exhibits—the successes, the happy moments, the flattering angles. But the storeroom, the messy workshop where things are actually made and broken, remains locked away from visitors. It's a necessary performance, I suppose. A social contract. Yet, it creates this strange distance, an unspoken agreement to admire the polished surfaces without ever asking what holds them up.
