I need you to listen to me. Really listen. You're looking at this one result, this single moment of rejection, and letting it define you completely. It's like you think your whole value is tied up in that one number on a page or that one 'no' from a stranger. But that’s not how it works. Your worth isn't something you have to earn or prove, and it's certainly not something they can take away. It was there before this moment, and it will be there long after. It’s in the way you make people feel safe, the ridiculous laugh you have when you're truly happy, the simple fact that you exist right here. That part of you is non-negotiable. This disappointment is just weather passing through; you are the sky.
