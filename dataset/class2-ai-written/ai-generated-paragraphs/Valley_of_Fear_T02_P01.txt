My uncle is at the grill, flipping burgers and telling some stupid joke about a talking dog. Everyone’s laughing, a perfect summer sound. My cousin claps him on the shoulder, and I catch a glimpse of the faint, silvery scar that traces the vein on his forearm. It’s almost invisible now, but I remember the story he told about a "workshop accident." I look around the sun-drenched patio. Aunt Carol refills the pitcher of lemonade, her hands so steady, but I know she can break a man’s wrist without a second thought. Little Timmy is chasing a soccer ball, and for a terrifying second, I see the same cold focus in his eyes that I see in his father's. They’re all just playing their parts, the good family, the friendly neighbors. But I know what happens when the party’s over, what the phone calls in the middle of the night really mean. I can't ever un-know it, and the smell of charcoal just makes me feel sick.
