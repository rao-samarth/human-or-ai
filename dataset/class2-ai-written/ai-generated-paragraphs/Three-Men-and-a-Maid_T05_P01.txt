The evening crowd spilled from the train station, a river of shoulders and hurried glances. He stood under the flickering neon of a pharmacy sign, an island in the current. He was here again, just like yesterday, and the day before that. His gaze scanned the faces, a practiced, automatic sweep that no longer registered individuals, only the constant, aching absence of the one he sought. What was he even hoping for anymore? A brief, accidental brush of hands in the throng? The logic had faded long ago, leaving only the habit, the strange pull toward this specific corner at this specific time. He knew it was pointless with a deep, settled certainty. Still, his feet carried him here. The city hummed with a million other destinations, but his was a fixed point, a quiet vigil for a person who didn't even know they were being waited for. He’d stay until the lights changed one last time, then walk home, already knowing he would return.
