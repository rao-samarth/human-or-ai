You always loved this room, didn't you? The way the moonlight hits the polished floorboards, the perfect stillness you called our sanctuary. But look closer. See that hairline crack spreading from beneath the bookshelf? I watch it every night. It's been there for years, a tiny, dark river I could never bring myself to fix because it felt more honest than anything else in this house. More honest than the dinner parties where our laughter was just a little too loud, or the vacation photos where we’re holding hands but my knuckles are white from the strain. You saw a beautiful life, a masterpiece we built together. But all I see now, sitting here in the quiet, is the structural damage. It was never a sanctuary; it was just a very, very well-decorated cage.
