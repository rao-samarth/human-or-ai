You know what the strangest part is? It’s the silence. For twenty years, my phone was an extension of my hand, a constant hum of demand, of crisis, of need. Now, it just sits there on the table, dark and quiet. I walk into rooms where my voice used to command immediate attention, where people would stop their own conversations to listen, and it’s like I’m a ghost at the feast. They nod politely, a quick, dismissive gesture, their eyes already scanning for someone more important, someone who still matters. They don’t see me; they see a relic, a man whose name used to mean something. I catch my reflection in shop windows and for a second, I barely recognize the person staring back. He’s just… some guy. All the pieces that made me *me* were tied to a position, a title, a key that no longer fits any lock. What are you supposed to do when the world decides you’re finished long before you are?
