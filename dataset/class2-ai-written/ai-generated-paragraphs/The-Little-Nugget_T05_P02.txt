The man’s phone call was a public performance, and the elderly woman beside him was his captive audience. She flinched with every booming laugh, her teacup rattling faintly in its saucer. My every instinct screamed at me to lean over and just *say* something. A simple, “Excuse me, could you possibly lower your voice?” would solve it in ten seconds flat. But then I caught the eyes of the other passengers. They weren't oblivious; they were masters of avoidance, studying their tickets, the grim countryside, anything but the obvious discomfort in their midst. To intervene felt like a social grenade, a brash intrusion that would mortify the very person I wanted to help. Yet to do nothing felt like complicity, a quiet surrender to a rudeness everyone acknowledged but no one would name. I was stuck between a helpful impulse and the paralyzing fear of committing the greater sin: making a scene.
