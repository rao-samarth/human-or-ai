The train shuddered through the countryside, and on the small screen above the seats, silent, urgent headlines scrolled by. No one was watching. A man across the aisle meticulously organized his travel documents into a plastic wallet. Two teenagers were laughing at something on a phone, their shared earbuds a thin white line between them. I tried to feel a sense of alarm, a civic duty to be concerned, but the feeling just wouldn't stick. What were we supposed to do, anyway, stuck in this carriage? Panic? The world outside the window felt abstract, like a movie someone else was watching. The landscape was turning industrial, which meant we were getting close. I felt a small, selfish thrill. My only real worry was whether the café near the station would still be open.
