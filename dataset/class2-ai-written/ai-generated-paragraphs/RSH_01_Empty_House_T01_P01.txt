I’m watching my uncle regale everyone with another story about his "booming" business, and my aunt just smiles, a little too brightly, nodding along. I know for a fact he’s about to lay off half his staff. Over by the window, my cousin is describing her amazing new apartment, conveniently leaving out the part where her roommate just moved out and she can’t afford the rent alone. We all play our parts. I just spent ten minutes telling my grandmother that my own job is "fulfilling" and "stable," glossing over the fact that I dread waking up every morning. We build these little walls of polite fiction around ourselves. It’s not about malice. It’s just easier this way. It’s how we get through dinner without the whole thing collapsing into a mess of anxieties and uncomfortable truths. It’s the armor we wear to the table.
