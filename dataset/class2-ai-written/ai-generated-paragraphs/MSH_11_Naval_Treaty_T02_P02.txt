From this hilltop, the city below looks like a circuit board of flickering lights and fresh possibilities. Just a month ago, my world felt so small, confined to the four walls of an office where my biggest venture had crumbled into dust. I’d measured my own worth in the project's failed milestones, and the weight of it all was crushing. But breathing the cool night air of a place where no one knows my name or my history, I feel a surprising lightness. The professional collapse I carried here seems so distant, a story belonging to someone else. It wasn’t a dead end after all. It was simply the unexpected turn in the path that led me to this exact view, to this quiet realization that the map of my life has just opened up again.
