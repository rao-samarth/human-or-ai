He stood by the railing, staring into the dark yard with a drink he hadn’t touched. “I’m not going to pretend I understand it,” he said without turning, his voice low and gravelly. “Why she chose you.” The silence stretched, thick and uncomfortable. I could have listed my job prospects, my plans, the ways I’d tried to prove myself. Instead, I came to stand beside him, watching the fireflies blink on and off in the blackness. “I know I’m not what you pictured for her, sir,” I finally said. “And I’ll probably spend the rest of my life not quite being the man you think she deserves. But I can promise you this: no one will ever work harder to make her happy. That’s the only thing I truly have, and it’s all hers.” He was quiet for a long time, then he finally picked up his glass and took a slow, deliberate sip. “See that you do,” he muttered, his gaze finally shifting from the yard to the brightly lit window where she was laughing.
