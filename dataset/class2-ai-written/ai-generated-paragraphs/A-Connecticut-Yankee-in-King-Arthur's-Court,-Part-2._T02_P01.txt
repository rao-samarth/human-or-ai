The chandeliers hum with a light that feels almost clinical, illuminating the practiced grace with which everyone moves. An invisible map of rank and privilege dictates every conversation, every subtle nod of acknowledgement. They genuinely believe their bloodline is a shield, a divine inheritance that sets them apart from common dirt and ambition. I watch them, a sea of silk and strained smiles, and I see the elaborate architecture of their beliefs holding it all aloft—a structure built from ghost stories. They cling to these hollow rituals, the proper way to hold a glass, the auspicious day for a contract, fearing that to question one part is to risk the entire collapse. It’s a prison of their own making, really, built not of stone but of shared delusions. They fear a world where merit might actually matter more than a family name whispered by a priest centuries ago.
