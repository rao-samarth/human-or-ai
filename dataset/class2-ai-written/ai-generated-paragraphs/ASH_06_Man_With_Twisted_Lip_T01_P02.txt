The final boarding call blared, a distorted sound swallowed by the station's chaos. I shoved through the crowd, my bag banging against my leg. A man in a tailored suit sidestepped neatly in front of me, a flash of polished leather shoes and a gold watch. He offered a quick, disarming smile—the kind that makes you instantly forgive the interruption. But his eyes weren’t on me. They were locked on the backpack of the woman just ahead. His hand, emerging from a starched white cuff, became a practiced blur. It was a fluid, almost elegant motion, dipping into her side pocket and retreating in a single heartbeat. He had her phone. Before I could even process the silent theft, he vanished, absorbed back into the river of commuters pushing toward the closing doors. The entire performance was flawless, a masterpiece of misdirection masked by an expensive facade.
