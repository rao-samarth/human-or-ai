You have to understand, it wasn't that I didn't want to act. I saw it all happening, every second of it. But my mind just fractured. It ran down a hundred different corridors at once, mapping out every possible consequence for every tiny gesture I might make. What if I moved left? What if I used that word instead of another? I built these elaborate scenarios, these intricate escape routes, searching for the one perfect, flawless response that guaranteed no one got hurt. I was so lost in the architecture of the solution, so busy drawing the blueprints for every potential future, that I completely missed the single moment that actually mattered. By the time I looked up from all my careful calculations, it was already over, and the room was silent.
