The raspberry-balsamic donut had vanished from the picnic blanket, and everyone was a suspect. But the evidence was all there, shimmering in the midday sun. A single, errant speck of green glitter clung to the napkin where the pastry had been. No one in our group had been near glitter. The jogger who’d passed by moments before, however, had a distinct sparkle on his left earlobe. Furthermore, the indentation in the grass next to our blanket was not from a casual loafer but from a specialized running shoe, the kind with aggressive, mud-shedding treads—entirely unnecessary for a paved city park path. He wasn't jogging for fitness; he was jogging for a getaway. The final clue? A faint whiff of cinnamon. My donut had no cinnamon. But the hot pretzel stand fifty yards downwind did. Our thief was a glitter-bombed, over-equipped jogger with a multi-course appetite. The case was, as they say, delicious.
