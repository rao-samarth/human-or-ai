It was three in the morning, and the ceramic goose was staring back at me. Sam had called it "majestic," which was a word I'd previously reserved for mountains and, on one occasion, a particularly well-made sandwich. But this goose... this goose was an abomination. Its beady eyes seemed to follow me, judging my very soul. A sacred pact, sworn in a treehouse on a diet of soda and gummy worms, demanded I tell Sam the truth: that his prized auction find looked like a half-melted traffic cone with a beak. But what about my honor? What about my reputation as the friend with taste? To crush his joy felt like a betrayal, yet to lie would be to betray a vow twenty years in the making. I paced the floor, caught between the sacred duty of friendship and the equally sacred duty of not letting a ceramic goose that looked like it had lost a bar fight become the centerpiece of our living room. The goose remained silent, offering no counsel.
