Water was pooling on the floorboards, a dark, spreading stain of an emergency we were utterly unprepared for. My partner, instead of grabbing anything valuable, was heroically rescuing his precious sourdough starter from the encroaching puddle, cradling the jar like a newborn. I should have been panicking, but I found myself laughing, a helpless, bubbling sound that mixed with the frantic clang of us arranging pots, pans, and even a colander to catch the drips. Through the window, the city lights blurred into a steady, indifferent hum, punctuated by a distant siren meant for some other, more serious crisis. We were a frantic, soaked, and oddly joyous team, united against a hostile pipe. In this ridiculous, beautiful mess of our own, all that mattered was mopping up and making sure the yeast lived to see another day.
