I’m supposed to stand here and talk about success. I’m supposed to look at all of you in your beautiful clothes and see triumph. But that’s not what I see. When I walked in tonight, I saw the woman polishing the brass on the front doors, her knuckles raw. I saw the kid who valet-parked my car, shivering in a thin coat because he couldn't afford a better one. These aren’t anecdotes; they are the price of admission. They are the invisible framework holding up this ceiling. We sit in this warm, bright room, but the truth is, the whole world is that cold street corner. We’ve just built a very small, very expensive tent and convinced ourselves it’s a fortress. This award... it feels less like a shield and more like a key to a prettier cage.
