Yes, I’m the one who did this to the land. But I followed every single instruction they gave me, the men from the city with their clean boots and their promises printed on glossy paper. They called my father’s methods antiquated, a waste of potential. They had charts showing futures I could barely imagine, full of efficiency and profit. So I listened. I tore up the old clover fields and drilled in their patented seed. I sprayed what they told me to spray, when they told me to spray it. For a while, the numbers on the page looked good. But just stand here for a moment. Listen. Do you hear any birds? Look at this soil, packed down hard as pavement. They sold me a blueprint for success, and I used it to meticulously build a wasteland.
