I’m sitting out on the stile, looking at the old stone wall that cuts the lower pasture from the hayfield. For years, it was just a boundary, a hard line on a map made real. Don’t cross it; that’s the neighbor’s land. Simple. But a while back, my grandad told me the two farmers who built it weren’t rivals, they were best friends. They constructed it together one summer, not to keep each other out, but to have a place to meet in the middle and share a drink after a long day. He said they called it the Friendship Wall. The name, just that one little story, changed everything. The moss-covered stones no longer look like a barrier. Instead, I see a seam, a place where things were joined together. A hundred tons of rock completely rearranged itself in my mind, all because of a few sentences spoken on a porch.
