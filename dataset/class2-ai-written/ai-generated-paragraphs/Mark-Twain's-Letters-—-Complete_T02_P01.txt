You keep talking about finding a 'new normal' as if it's some destination on a map, a place I just haven't found the right road to yet. But that's not what this is. For me, it feels like the map itself burned. The entire landscape I spent my life learning is just gone, replaced by smoke and silence. I'm not trying to find my way *back* to anything, because there is no 'back' anymore. Every day is just learning to take a single step on unfamiliar ground, without any signposts to tell me if I'm even moving forward. So when you offer directions or tell me to look for a landmark, it just reminds me that you’re still holding a map to a world that no longer exists for me. Please, just let me be lost for a while.
