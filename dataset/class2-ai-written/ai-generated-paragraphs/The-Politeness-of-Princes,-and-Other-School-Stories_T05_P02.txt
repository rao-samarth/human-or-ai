The woman behind the thick glass at the permits office never once made eye contact. I had only asked about a small pot of lavender for my apartment windowsill, a tiny patch of purple against the endless grey. She slid a hefty packet of forms through the small opening, her nail tapping the top page. Form 7B, she explained in a monotone, was the application for a Non-Structural Façade Adornment. I would also need a notarized letter from my building's owner and a certified diagram of the pot’s drainage capabilities. For a moment, all I could hear was the muffled roar of traffic outside, a constant, indifferent river of noise. I pictured the little lavender plant, shivering on the concrete ledge. She cleared her throat, finally looking at me with tired eyes, and informed me that the fine for an unlicensed plant was significantly more than the plant itself.
