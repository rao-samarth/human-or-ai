It’s not the elaborate falsehood that’s most dangerous, you see. It’s the performance of absolute normalcy. The most profound deception isn't a story told, but a life meticulously curated to appear unremarkable, even virtuous. Think of it as a form of social camouflage.

It’s designed to neutralize suspicion before it can even form. The actual harmful act, when it finally occurs, seems like a shocking aberration, a break in character. But it’s not. The character was the lie all along, and the harmful act was the one moment of authentic intent breaking through that carefully crafted surface.
