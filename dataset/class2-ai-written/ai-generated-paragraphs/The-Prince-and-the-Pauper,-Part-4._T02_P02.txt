Out here, where the old stone walls crumble just enough to let the wildflowers through, it’s easier to see things clearly. We spent all winter arguing about boundaries and what was owed, drawing hard lines in the dirt just to feel right. But the spring rain doesn't care for our lines; it softens the ground for everyone. Watching the new shoots push stubbornly through the soil, you start to realize that fairness isn't about the rigidness of the fence posts, but about giving everything the space and the light it needs to grow. It’s about listening to the story the wind tells as it moves through the tall grass, a story that doesn't have sharp edges or simple villains. A community, like a field, thrives not on strict division but on the shared understanding that we all need a little sun, a little rain, and the grace to bend without breaking.
