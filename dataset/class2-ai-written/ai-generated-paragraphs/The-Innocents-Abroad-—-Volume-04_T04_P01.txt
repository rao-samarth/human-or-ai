I watch them from my desk, the new "transformation" team. They've colonized the big conference room, its glass walls now obscured by a frantic collage of sticky notes and diagrams only they can decipher. They stride about with the confident air of founders discovering a new continent, speaking a dialect of disruption and synergy that nobody else understands. It's almost comical. Yesterday, their lead consultant, the one who talks about building our future from the ground up, got his tie stuck in the shredder. They act as if this entire department was just fallow ground before their arrival, a void waiting for their grand vision. But from here, it just looks like they’re making a huge mess, blissfully unaware of the perfectly functional system they’re so determined to save.
