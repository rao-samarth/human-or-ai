You still believe it’s about what’s right, don’t you? You think if we just present the facts, if we plead our case with enough passion, that some grand scale will balance itself out. But it won’t. This whole process isn’t a search for truth; it’s a grinding of gears, a cold engine that was set in motion long before we ever got here. It doesn't care about his character or your tears. It only cares about procedure, about precedent, about the neat and tidy closing of a file. We are not arguing a man’s innocence to a jury of his peers; we are screaming into the mechanics of a vast, indifferent machine. And all it knows how to do is run its course, crushing whatever gets caught in its path and labeling the wreckage as the correct and lawful outcome.
