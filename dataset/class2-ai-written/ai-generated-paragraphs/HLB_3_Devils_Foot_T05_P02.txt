The fluorescent lights of the all-night diner hummed, casting a sickly yellow glow on the untouched coffee. "You can't be serious," she whispered, her eyes wide across the cracked vinyl booth. "His business, his house… that’s not justice, it's madness." He slowly stirred his black coffee, the spoon clinking softly against the ceramic mug. He didn't look up. "They said what they did to him was just business. Collateral damage." He finally met her gaze, and the cold emptiness there was more terrifying than any rage. "He was my entire world. He painted that ridiculous mural on our garage door just to make me laugh on my way to work. They laughed about it. So, yes. I am serious. I will tear down everything they built. I'll leave them with nothing but dust and echoes, a life that feels exactly like mine does now. Every single brick I pull down will be a monument to him."
