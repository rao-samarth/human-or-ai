The noise of this city is a constant hum—sirens, fragmented conversations, the rumble of a train beneath my feet. Everyone is rushing, projecting an image, selling a version of themselves. For so long, I felt I had to shout my own story over this din, to fight against the narratives that were being built, to convince everyone of what was real. But standing here, just a face in the anonymous river of people, a quiet understanding settles over me. The actual thing that happened doesn't need my defense. It just exists. It’s like the bedrock under all this concrete, solid and unmoving, indifferent to the chaos above. All the shouting and the elaborate fictions are just weather on the surface. Eventually, the storm passes, the noise fades, and the ground is still there, exactly where it has always been.
