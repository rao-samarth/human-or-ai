Do you remember how we spent all those nights, just scrolling through those forums, convinced we were learning some profound secret? We really thought if we just visualized hard enough, if we whispered the right words into the dark before sleeping, it would all materialize. We were so occupied with mapping a future that never existed. We let the paint peel in the hallway and ignored the silence that grew between us, all because we were chasing a feeling, a promise someone sold us in a five-minute video. All that time, all that hope, and the only thing that ever really changed was the view outside the window, season after season, while we were looking somewhere else entirely. The world kept turning without us.
