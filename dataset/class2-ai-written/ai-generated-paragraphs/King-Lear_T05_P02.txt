I overheard someone talking on the train, and it made me think. She was saying how it was a mess at first, of course, when the old committee just packed up and left. For a few weeks, it was pure chaos. Everyone was shouting their own brilliant ideas, but nobody was listening, and nothing was actually getting done. You could feel the fear setting in. But then, a funny thing started to happen. The woman who runs the corner bakery began organizing food shares, just quietly, with no fanfare. A couple of teenagers who were always tinkering with old bikes figured out how to get the water pumps running again. People stopped waiting for instructions that were never going to come. They just started *doing*. It's slower, yes, and it’s certainly not perfect, but look around now. We’re building something from the ground up, together. It feels more real, more solid, because it’s ours.
