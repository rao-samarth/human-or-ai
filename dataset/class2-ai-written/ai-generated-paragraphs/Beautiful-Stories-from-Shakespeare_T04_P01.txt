Mark waved from the kitchen, a quick, familiar gesture over the top of his monitor. I needed the final numbers. I pushed my chair back, the wheels groaning on the polished concrete. Weaving through the maze of desks, I saw his green sweater, the same one he always wore on Thursdays. But the kitchen was empty. Only the low hum of the refrigerator and the bitter smell of stale coffee. Maybe the restroom? My phone buzzed in my pocket. A new message on the team channel, time-stamped just seconds ago from Mark: “Morning all, WFH today. Woke up with a killer migraine.” I stared at the screen, then back at the empty space where he had stood. The green sweater. The wave. It was perfectly clear. A flicker in the polished chrome of the espresso machine caught my eye—a distorted reflection, a trick of the light. Suddenly, the entire office felt like a projection, a thin veneer of pixels stretched over an unnerving silence. My own hands on my phone looked foreign, unreal.
