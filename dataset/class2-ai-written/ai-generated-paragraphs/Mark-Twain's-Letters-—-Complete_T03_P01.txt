The cursor blinks, a patient, rhythmic pulse against the sterile white of the document. This is the fourth revision of a simple internal announcement, each iteration further sanding away any trace of an authentic voice. The words are supposed to be clear and optimized, but they feel hollowed out, like architectural models of a building that will never be lived in. There was once a thrill in finding the right phrase, a small, private magic in fitting sounds and meanings together. Now, that impulse is just a ghost in the machine, overruled by brand guidelines and the silent, data-driven judgment of what performs best. The office has emptied out, leaving only the low hum of the servers and this collection of careful, vacant sentences that no longer feel like they belong to anyone.
