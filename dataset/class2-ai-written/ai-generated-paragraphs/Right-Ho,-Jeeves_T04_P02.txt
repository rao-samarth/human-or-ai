He was *slobbering*. A small, dark patch was spreading, a stain on centuries of carefully curated heritage. Her heart hammered against her ribs. Had anyone seen?

The silence would ripple. The judgment would be swift, masked by polite inquiries about the dog’s “charming personality.” This was a catastrophe. More than the market dip last quarter, more than her son’s unfortunate political leanings. This was a public failure of control. With a barely perceptible flick of her wrist, she caught the butler’s eye, a silent, desperate command that screamed *handle it now* before their entire social standing unraveled right there on the drawing-room floor.
