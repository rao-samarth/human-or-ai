The roar of traffic from the street below was a constant, indifferent hum, a sound that swallowed every other noise. I watched them from the window: a thousand different stories moving in a thousand directions, each person the absolute center of their own world. And a profound shame washed over me, cold and sharp, for the times I had tried to be an architect for someone else’s soul. I had handed them my own blueprints, convinced of their perfection, and grown furious when they refused to build. How could I have been so blind? You cannot correct a life you have not lived. Down there, a woman hailed a taxi while a man argued into his phone, and I finally understood that my map was only ever meant for my own journey, a useless, arrogant scrawl in the face of their infinite, unknowable territories.
