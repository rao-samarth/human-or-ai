You leave these little arrangements for me to find—a polished river stone, a single crow's feather, a circle drawn in ash by the door. You think you're speaking some profound, secret language, but what if I'm interpreting it all wrong? A sign of protection to you could be a warning to me. A symbol of peace might just look like a surrender. We build these private vocabularies, these intricate codes meant for only two people, forgetting that meaning isn't inherent in the object itself. It’s a fragile agreement. And when one person stops explaining the rules, the other is just left staring at a collection of beautiful, meaningless things, a language that has lost its key. What am I supposed to do with all this silence you’ve shaped into puzzles?
