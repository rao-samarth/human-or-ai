He preached that loyalty was a liability and that sentiment was a weakness to be exploited on the way to the top. He mentored a generation of piranhas, shaping them in his own image, and for a while, he swam untouchable among them. The irony is, they learned his lessons too well. The very mechanisms of betrayal he perfected were eventually turned against him by his most promising protégé. He didn't see it coming. How could he? He had designed a world without trust, then seemed surprised when no one could be trusted. He meticulously built the engine of his own destruction, and in the end, it just ran him over.
