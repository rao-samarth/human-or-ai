The river of people flows around me, each person an island of purpose, their eyes fixed on some unseen destination. They all carry this frantic energy, this desperate need to acquire, to climb, to own a piece of this concrete mountain range. You can see it in the way they build ever-higher towers that stab at the sky, not for beauty, but simply to be taller than the next one. It's a relentless hunger. And what happens when you get it all? I look at the faces in the luxury cars, sealed behind tinted glass, and they don't look happy, just… insulated. It’s as if the more you add to the outside—the bigger the office, the faster the car—the more something essential gets scraped away from the inside. A city of magnificent shells, all echoing with the same profound emptiness. Everyone just scrambling for more, never stopping to ask if "more" was ever the point.
