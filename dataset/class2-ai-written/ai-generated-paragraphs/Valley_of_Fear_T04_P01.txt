The rhythmic clatter of the train should have been soothing, but my heart was hammering a frantic counterpoint against my ribs. And there he was. Four rows ahead, asleep against the window, his head lolling with the motion of the carriage. His bag was unzipped on the seat beside him, the corner of a laptop and a leather wallet visible. A hot, sharp impulse shot through me: take it. It would be a fraction of what he’d stolen, a small rebalancing of a universe he had knocked askew. But my hands remained clenched in my lap, knuckles white. The thought wasn't about recovery; it was about him waking up in a foreign city, panicked and powerless, the way he’d left my family. Stripping him of his security felt like the only equitable response, a consequence he had earned. Every clack of the wheels on the track seemed to pose the same question, and I had no answer.
