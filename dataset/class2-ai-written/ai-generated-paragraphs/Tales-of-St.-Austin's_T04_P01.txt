I was sitting near the window of a quiet cafe when I overheard them. Two men, well into their sixties, nursing their coffees. One of them sighed, a heavy, tired sound. “It was the window,” he said, not to me, but to his friend. “He never said a word. Just stood there and took it, even when they expelled him.” His companion just nodded, stirring a sugar packet he had no intention of using. “We all knew,” he murmured. “It was what you did. But you never think about where that road leads, do you? Not at that age.” The silence that followed was thick with things left unsaid. It was a strange, binding agreement from a time when keeping your mouth shut meant everything, even more than your own future. He just let his own name get dragged through the mud, and we all let him.
