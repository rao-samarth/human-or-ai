I used to think David from the finance department was carved from granite. His desk was always a sterile landscape of black and silver, his emails were models of brutal efficiency, and he never once joined in for the awkward Friday cake celebrations. We all just sort of gave him a wide berth, assuming he was all business, maybe even a little heartless. But then I stayed late one evening, and as I walked past his cubicle, I heard him on the phone. His voice was completely different—soft and full of patient laughter, and he was making an alarmingly accurate series of farm animal noises for what I assume was his kid. It completely rewired my perception. Suddenly, the rigid perfectionism wasn't intimidating; it felt more like armor, the carefully constructed shell of a person just trying to be a good dad and get home on time.
