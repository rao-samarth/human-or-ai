The floorboard's groan jolted him from a thin sleep. He didn't wait for a second sound. His hand, already knowing the motion, closed around the cold iron poker beside the hearth. He moved without a lamp, a shadow slipping through deeper shadows, his own breathing a harsh rhythm in the silent house. The bolt on the first door was secure. The heavy bar on the second hadn't shifted. Still, the certainty clawed at his gut: a piece of his investment had walked away. He kicked open the door to the cramped sleeping quarters, the wood slamming against the wall. A foul, close air hit him. He didn't need to see their faces; he just started lashing out with his boot, feeling the soft thuds against unseen bodies. "Who's gone?" he snarled, his voice a low threat that cut through the terrified silence.
