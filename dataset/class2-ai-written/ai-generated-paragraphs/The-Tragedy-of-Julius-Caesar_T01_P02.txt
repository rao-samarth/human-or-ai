The morning mist was slow to burn off the low fields, clinging to the fences like a shroud. From the window, I watched the familiar lines of the stone walls that had been there for generations. A promise made years ago felt just as solid, just as permanent. It was a simple vow of allegiance, spoken without a second thought at the time, but it had since become a heavy chain. The right course of action seemed so clear when viewed in isolation—a simple matter of principle, of doing what any decent person would. Yet that action required me to turn my back on the one person I had sworn to support. It felt like a betrayal of both myself and another, a paradox with no clean solution. To keep my word would be to abandon my own moral compass; to follow that compass would be to break my word. The mist lingered, obscuring the path forward.
