You always said nothing ever happens out here, that the days just bleed into one another in a pleasant, predictable haze. But I've been watching Mr. Abernathy's shop. It’s still the same place, smelling of wood polish and old paper, with him behind the counter like a permanent fixture. The thing is, a large, unmarked van arrives every Tuesday, always around three in the morning when the moon is down. He told Mrs. Gable it was for artisanal cheeses, but the crates they unload are far too heavy, and I’ve never seen a single one on his shelves. He just smiles that same placid smile as he signs the driver’s manifest under the single bulb of his porch light. Everyone hears the engine, I’m sure of it, but it’s just become another sound of the night, as normal as a fox barking in the woods.
