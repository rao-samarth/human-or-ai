Oh, absolutely, I'm having a blast. This whole "will they, won't they" game is the peak of modern romance. First, there was the cryptic text at 2 AM that was probably meant for their cat. Then the "accidental" like on a photo from three years ago. I'm supposed to interpret these clues like some kind of heartbroken detective, right? It’s not a relationship; it’s an escape room where the prize is maybe, just maybe, a coffee date next Tuesday, if the stars align and their ex doesn’t suddenly need help moving a sofa. It’s thrilling. Truly. I’m on the edge of my seat, wondering if the next breadcrumb will be a vaguely worded horoscope or just complete ghosting for a week. My life has become a poorly written romantic comedy, and I'm not even the main character—I'm the confused, over-caffeinated sidekick.
