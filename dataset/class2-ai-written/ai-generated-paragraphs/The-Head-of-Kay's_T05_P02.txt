Staring out of this train window, the green landscape a blur, I got a message from an old school friend. It was just a ridiculous photo, but it instantly threw me back. Back to us. We were more than just a group of mates back then; we were a self-contained unit, a small, stubborn nation with unwritten laws. A shared look across a classroom was a complete conversation. A subtle nod in the hallway was a binding contract. We operated on a system of loyalty so absolute it was almost comical, a silent pact that meant you’d share your lunch money, cover for a missed homework assignment, or face a teacher's wrath together. It was our own little world, carved out of the larger, confusing one. The rules of that world don’t really apply out here, but the connection somehow still does. That's the weird thing about it. It was a shield we built together, and I guess parts of it are still there.
