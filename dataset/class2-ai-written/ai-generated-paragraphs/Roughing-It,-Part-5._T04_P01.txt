I was listening to the couple at the next table dissecting some political crisis with the detached precision of surgeons, using words like “paradigm” and “normative frameworks.” It was all very clean, a neat intellectual exercise conducted over artisanal coffee. Then, an ambulance siren ripped through the quiet street outside, a raw, desperate sound that made the windowpane vibrate. For a brief second, their faces went blank, their structured conversation collapsing into the shared, animal instinct of registering a cry for help. The man even flinched. But just as quickly, the moment passed. He cleared his throat, picked up his tiny spoon to stir a drink that didn't need stirring, and calmly resumed his point about structural decay, as if the shriek from the real world was merely an inconvenient footnote to be smoothed over and forgotten.
