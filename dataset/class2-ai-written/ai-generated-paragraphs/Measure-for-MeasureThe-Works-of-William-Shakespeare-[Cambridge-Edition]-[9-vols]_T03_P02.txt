The crickets sawed away at the silence, their relentless chorus a judgment in the heavy, humid air. I sat on the porch steps, the wood still holding the day’s heat, and replayed the lie. It was a beautiful lie, wasn't it? Crafted with care, delivered with a gentle smile, all to shield someone from a truth that would have shattered them. I told myself it was kindness, a necessary act of compassion. But here, with the last light bleeding from the sky and the first stars emerging like cold, distant eyes, the nobility of my action began to rot. Was it compassion, or was it a desperate exertion of power? A way to manage another's pain because I couldn't bear to witness it? The conviction that I had done the right thing was crumbling, leaving behind the sickening suspicion that my virtue was just a more palatable form of selfishness.
