You have to admire the sheer, unwavering consistency of it all. The same faces from the same handful of schools, now just with more expensive tailoring and slightly receding hairlines, all gathered to pass judgment under the guise of celebration. They’re congratulating the groom, but what they’re really doing is conducting a silent, merciless audit of his life choices. Did he marry *up*? Is her family’s money ‘new’ or ‘proper’? Every warm smile is an appraisal, every polite inquiry a probe for weakness. The air is thick with the ghosts of long-dead headmasters, all silently critiquing your choice of canapé and your career trajectory. Honestly, you could invent cold fusion, but if your tie knot wasn't quite right, they’d just murmur something about your 'background' and move on. It’s not a party; it’s a decade-on-decade peer review with lukewarm champagne.
