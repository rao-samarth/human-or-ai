The ceramic mug was warm in his hands, a small anchor in the cafe’s chaotic symphony of hissing steam and clattering plates. He was invisible here, just another face. Then a voice sliced through the noise, sharp and clear from the queue near the door. It wasn't his name—not the one he used now—but the one he had buried fifteen years ago under a mountain of lies. The spoon slipped from his numb fingers, ringing against the saucer. Hot coffee scalded his wrist; he barely registered the sting. His head snapped up, eyes scanning the crowd with a predator’s urgency. A woman on her phone. She laughed, repeating the name. A coincidence. It had to be a coincidence. But then she turned, and her eyes, wide with sudden recognition, locked onto his. The smile vanished. The world compressed to the space between them, and his only instinct screamed: run. He kicked his chair back, the legs screeching on the tile as he lunged for the exit, leaving everything behind all over again.
