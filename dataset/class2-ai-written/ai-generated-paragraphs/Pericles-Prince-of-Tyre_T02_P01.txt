You see the end result, this quiet life, and you assume it was a simple destination. It wasn’t. For years, every single morning was a conscious choice to simply exist for one more day, a deliberate effort to breathe when there was no grand hope on the horizon. There was only the grim necessity of putting one foot in front of the other through the wreckage. But something strange happens when you survive that kind of pressure for that long. It doesn't just make you harder; it clarifies things. It burns away everything that isn't essential. All the noise, the petty fears, the person you thought you were supposed to be—it all turns to ash. What’s left is a foundation. It’s not pretty, and it’s covered in scars, but it is real. It is yours. And you can finally build something on it that won't ever fall down.
