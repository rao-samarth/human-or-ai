We're so desperate to build a perfect life, to follow a map where every turn is correct. But the real cartography of the self is drawn by the detours, isn't it? It’s sketched in the ink of our own foolishness. I used to think every stumble was a personal failing, a crack in the foundation. Now, I see those moments differently. They weren't cracks; they were the openings where the light got in. You don't truly grasp the weight of your own choices until you've had to clean up a mess entirely of your own making. It’s a humbling, necessary education that no success can ever provide. It’s in the mending, the quiet work of putting things right, that you finally understand the scope of what you are capable of, both for ill and for good.
