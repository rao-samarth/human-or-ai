I’m sitting here, watching you at the head table, and it’s a little surreal. Everyone is raising a glass to this accomplished adult, this new spouse, and of course, I see that too. But for a split second, when you caught my eye across the room and did that ridiculous half-smirk, the entire formal affair just fell away. Suddenly, we were seventeen again, leaning against the scuffed lockers, convinced we had the entire world figured out between one class and the next. It’s funny, isn't it? How we can navigate all this—the speeches, the fancy clothes, the very real and serious vows—and still be those same kids, communicating an entire novel with a single look. All these new, wonderful people have entered your life, but that old, comfortable language we built out of whispered jokes and shared anxieties is still perfectly fluent.
