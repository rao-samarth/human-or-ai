The dynamic in the breakroom has gotten so strange. Before, he and I had this easy rhythm, our own little pocket of the day carved out between meetings where we could actually talk. We’d dissect the latest all-hands email or just complain about the terrible coffee. It was simple. But ever since he started seeing her, it feels like I’m on borrowed time. Today, we were mid-sentence, laughing about something, when she walked in. His focus just… snapped. His whole posture shifted towards her, and the smile he gave her was completely different from the one he’d just had for me. Suddenly, our conversation felt like the pre-show, and the main event had just arrived. I mumbled something about a deadline and walked away, leaving them in a bubble that I definitely wasn’t a part of anymore.
