Don’t you dare talk to me about courage. You think it's a performance? A loud declaration for everyone to applaud? You see me hesitate and you call it fear, but you have no idea what it costs to stand on this edge. You don't see the careful planning behind the silence, the nights spent mapping out every single risk because I know, better than anyone, what we stand to lose. I am done explaining myself to you. I am done trying to make you understand that some battles aren't won with speeches. So keep your opinions. Judge my quiet resolve all you want. My proof was never going to be spoken here, between these walls. It’s out there, waiting for me. Just watch.
