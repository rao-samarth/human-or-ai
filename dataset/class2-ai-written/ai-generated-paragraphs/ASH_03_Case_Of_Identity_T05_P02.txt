The neighbors think I’m a breath of fresh air, the city girl who finally found her peace baking bread and tending to the garden. They see me and they see simplicity. It’s a useful perception. When he gets a little distant, a little quiet, I can just smile and say the country life takes some getting used to. I’ll make his favorite dinner and "accidentally" let my phone die when his mother tries to call. He doesn't need that kind of static. What he needs is this quiet, this carefully managed calm I've built around us. Sometimes, I see a flicker of the man he was before, a restlessness in his eyes, but it fades. He’s like a plant I’ve repotted. It takes time for the old roots to forget their previous soil and learn to thrive only in the earth I provide.
