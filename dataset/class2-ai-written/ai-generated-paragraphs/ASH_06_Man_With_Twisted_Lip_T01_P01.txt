Oh, the profound tranquility of the countryside. It’s a masterpiece, really. Each cottage is a study in rustic charm, with its perfectly painted trim and gardens that look suspiciously like they’ve been curated by a committee for Maximum Quaintness. The locals drift by with their serene, empty smiles, offering a friendly wave that says both "hello" and "I'm noting the time you left your house." It’s all so wholesome, so utterly peaceful. You can almost forget that the prettiest flowers often have the deadliest poison, or that the most immaculate lawns are usually hiding the most tangled roots. Everyone here is just so committed to the performance of placid perfection, it’s almost admirable. They’ve polished the surface so thoroughly you can’t see the cracks, unless you know exactly where to look. What a lovely, quiet place to bury a secret.
