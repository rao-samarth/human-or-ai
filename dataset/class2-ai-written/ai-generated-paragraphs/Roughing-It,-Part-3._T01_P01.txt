“You have nothing to say?” she whispered, her voice sharp enough to cut through the late-night silence. He wouldn’t look at her, just kept staring at the empty space on the wall where the ridiculous plasma screen used to hang. “A year ago, you bought a boat. A boat, David. You hate the ocean. Now we’re counting change for milk and you’re just… staring.” He finally turned, his face illuminated by the single lamp on the end table. “It was like a fever,” he said, his own voice hollow. “Everything was bright and loud and fast, and then you wake up and it’s all gone. The boat, the watches, the friends who only drank the expensive stuff. It was never really mine to keep. It just passed through me, like a ghost.” She shook her head, a single, bitter laugh escaping her lips as she gestured around the half-empty room. “A ghost left us with very real bills.”
