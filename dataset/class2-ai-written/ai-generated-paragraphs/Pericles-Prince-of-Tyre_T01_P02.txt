Just watch them for a minute, the endless stream of people convinced they’re the main character. There’s the entrepreneur in the sharp suit, practically floating down the pavement because he just closed a big deal. He thinks he's cracked the code. Give it a week. The market will dip, a slicker competitor will poach his client, and he’ll be back to stress-eating cheap takeout in his overpriced apartment. And see that artist over there, staring at a rejection email on her phone? Absolutely tragic. But next month, some trend-chasing blogger will discover her work, and suddenly she'll be the one everyone wants to know. It’s all just a big, stupid washing machine cycle. The clothes tumble, the music changes, but you always end up right back where you started, just a little more worn out. Enjoy the view from the top while it lasts.
