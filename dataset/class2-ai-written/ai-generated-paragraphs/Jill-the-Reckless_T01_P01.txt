I was trying to enjoy my overpriced latte at the museum cafe, but the women at the next table were practically broadcasting. Apparently, the primary crisis of the week was that someone at the dog park had also named their rescue dog ‘Jasper.’ This was, I gathered, a catastrophic dilution of her own Jasper’s brand identity, a purebred she had waited eighteen months for. Her companion, stirring a sad-looking scone, offered a solution with grave sincerity. “You should simply add a Roman numeral,” she suggested. “Jasper the Second. It implies a dynasty.” The owner sighed, a sound of profound suffering that made me glance over. “But darling, his custom-monogrammed Hermès collar is already engraved. It would be a complete waste.”
