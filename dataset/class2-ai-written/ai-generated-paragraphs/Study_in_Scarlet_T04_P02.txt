You always prided yourself on reading people, didn't you? A real judge of character. You saw the clean-shaven face, the pressed suit, the calm way I handled a crisis, and you built a whole story around it. He’s the anchor, you thought. The reliable one. But it was just a costume, and a cheap one at that. You never bothered to look at the frantic work happening backstage, did you? You just enjoyed the show. All of this, this entire enterprise, wasn't built on solid ground. It was built on your assumption that a man who looks the part must also be the part. That was your mistake, not mine. I just gave you exactly what you were looking for.
