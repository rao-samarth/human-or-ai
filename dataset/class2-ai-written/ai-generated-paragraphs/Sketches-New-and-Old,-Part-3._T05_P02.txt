He could confess, explain that an hour with a good saw would solve everything his complex charts and synergistic proposals had failed to. Or, he could clear his throat, point vaguely downstream, and begin the solemn-toned discussion about securing funding for phase two. The silence stretched, broken only by the sound of water struggling against wood.
