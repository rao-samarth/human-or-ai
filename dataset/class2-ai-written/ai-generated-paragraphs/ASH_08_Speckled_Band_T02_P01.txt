You see the crowds, don’t you? You see the endless stream of faces flowing under the streetlights, their reflections shimmering on the wet pavement after a downpour, and you think it’s life. You hear the noise—the distant sirens, the chatter from open-air cafes, the relentless hum of it all—and you call it a heartbeat. But I walked among them, and I saw something else entirely. Their eyes were vacant, their smiles were just shapes their mouths made. It was a beautiful, intricate machine, but it was hollow. There was nothing inside any of them. I was the only one who noticed the intricate dance was missing a soul, that the whole grand performance was for an empty theater. And when you realize something is just a beautiful, empty shell, you feel an overwhelming urge to see if it will break.
