The new medical clinic gleamed under the afternoon sun, its automated glass doors sliding open with a soft hiss for a woman pushing a stroller. Its walls were smooth, prefabricated panels, the color of a pale sky, all clean lines and sensible right angles. It stood on the corner where the old courthouse annex used to be. Next to it, the town’s original library remained, a stone Goliathan with a sagging roofline and boarded-up Palladian windows. Intricate carvings of forgotten virtues eroded above the lintel, green with moss. People had tried to save it, of course. There were committees, fundraisers, impassioned speeches about heritage. But the wiring was a fire hazard and the foundation was sinking. The clinic, built in six months, now saw fifty patients a day. It wasn't beautiful, but it was there, and it worked.
