The speaker on the podium is hitting all the classic notes again: integrity, perseverance, the inherent goodness of the human spirit. It’s a truly moving performance, especially considering half the people in this room got here by creatively interpreting the definition of "integrity." I watch the C-suite executives, all gleaming teeth and thousand-dollar suits, nodding along with such earnest expressions. They seem genuinely touched by the story of the tortoise and the hare, a fable that somehow forgot to mention the part where the hare buys the tortoise’s company in a hostile takeover and outsources the entire finish line. We’re all supposed to absorb these wonderful lessons about honesty and kindness paying off in the end. It's a lovely thought, a comforting bedtime story for adults who know perfectly well that the real world rewards the wolf, especially the one clever enough to dress up as a particularly sincere sheep.
