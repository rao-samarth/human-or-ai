The clinking of wine glasses and the murmur of familiar voices should have been comforting, but instead, they form a strange, distant soundtrack to my own isolation. A person’s character, it seems, is not a solid thing built over a lifetime, but a fragile construct held entirely in the minds of others. An accusation doesn't just question your actions; it rewrites your entire history, retroactively turning every past kindness into a potential deception and every silence into an admission of guilt. I watch my uncle tell a joke, and I see the flicker of doubt in his eyes as he glances my way. In that moment, I am two people: the man I know myself to be, and the monster of their new narrative. The most unnerving part is realizing that the monster is the more compelling character, and that innocence is not a state of being, but a story you have to convince everyone to believe.
