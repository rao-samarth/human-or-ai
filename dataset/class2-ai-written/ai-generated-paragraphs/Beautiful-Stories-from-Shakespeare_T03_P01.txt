“Was it worth it?” The question hung in the stale, lamplit air between them, sharp as a shard of glass. “All of it. The whispers, the little poisons you dripped into everyone’s ears, just to watch me fall. Look around you. This is what you won. An empty room, a broken trust, and the ghost of something we once called love. You wanted to see me ruined, but you were so blinded by your own bitter envy that you never realized you were setting fire to the foundations of your own home. You stand there now, king of the ashes, and I hope the silence is everything you dreamed it would be. You didn't just break me; you annihilated us. There's nothing left to salvage here. Not a single stone.”
