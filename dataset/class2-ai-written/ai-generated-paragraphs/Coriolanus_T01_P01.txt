From the small cafe table, I’ve noticed a recurring type of traveler, one who moves through foreign spaces not with curiosity, but with an unshakeable conviction of their own importance. They treat local customs as quaint hurdles and language barriers as failures of the native speaker. Today’s example was a man holding court at the train station, loudly critiquing the transit system’s inefficiency into his phone while ignoring the queue. He radiated an aura of being above it all, a master of logistics simply inconvenienced by a lesser world. His grand performance, however, ended abruptly. So absorbed was he in his own pronouncements that he failed to notice his own train, the one clearly displayed on the board above him, silently slide out of the station. The sudden, quiet emptiness on the platform seemed to be the only thing that could finally puncture his self-assured bubble.
