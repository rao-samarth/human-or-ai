The countryside just blurs past the train window, a smudge of green and brown I can't be bothered to focus on. My mind is stuck back in that sterile embassy office, replaying the attaché's words. It’s for the good of the nation, he said, a simple transaction. But it’s not simple. I looked that man in the eye and gave him my word he’d be safe with me, that his name would never cross my lips. My grandfather used to say a man is nothing without his word. And what are they asking me to be? A patriot. They want me to sacrifice one man's life, and my own integrity, for an abstract idea of national security. The rhythmic clatter of the wheels on the track sounds like a clock ticking down on a promise I’m not sure I can keep. I just keep staring out at the fleeting landscape, feeling like I'm traveling in two opposite directions at once.
