I thought I was making a connection. I turned to the man on my left, a stiff-looking gentleman with a title I immediately forgot, and told him with genuine enthusiasm how much I admired his latest project. He simply paused, adjusted his spectacles, and offered a thin smile. "Such earnestness," he murmured, "is a uniquely refreshing import." Then he turned back to his soup. The comment hung in the air, neither a compliment nor an insult, just a classification. The gentle clinking of silverware resumed, but the silence felt different to me now. Everyone else seemed to be playing a game with unwritten rules, a contest of subtle digs and layered irony, while I had just walked onto the court and tried to shake hands. I felt impossibly loud without having raised my voice at all.
