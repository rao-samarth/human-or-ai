He’s looking at me like I’m a fool, like this is all some pointless, dusty ceremony. He sees the three clockwise turns we’re supposed to make as just an annoyance, a silly delay before we can finally leave the room. I want to tell him it’s not about superstition. It was never about that. My grandmother explained it once, quietly, when I was small enough to not understand the weight of her words. The first turn is for those who came before you, acknowledging their path. The second is for your own journey, finding your place in the line. And the third… the third is for those who will come after, smoothing the way for them. He just sees walking in a circle. But it’s a compass. It’s a way of orienting yourself in time when you feel lost, a silent promise that you are part of something continuous.
