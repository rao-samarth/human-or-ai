I've been thinking about that presentation you gave when I first joined, the one about safeguarding national infrastructure and building a legacy of innovation for our own people. It's funny how that message slowly eroded, isn't it? It began with small compromises, then bigger ones, until I found myself signing off on data packages that I knew were heading to competitors who don't share our values or our allegiances. You talked about market realities and the pressures of the board, but what it came down to was a simple calculation. You traded a generation of our country's competitive advantage for a few more percentage points on the stock price. I hope the dividend was worth it, because the cost was far higher than anything you'll ever see on a balance sheet. I can no longer participate in this.
