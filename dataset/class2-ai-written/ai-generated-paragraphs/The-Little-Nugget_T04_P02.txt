Glass shattered downstairs. We froze. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat in the sudden, terrible silence. He grabbed my arm, pulling me without a word behind the heavy oak door of the study. His eyes, wide but steady, pointed to the closet. We squeezed inside, the smell of mothballs and old wool filling the cramped space as the floorboards creaked under heavy, unfamiliar footsteps. Shouts echoed from the living room, muffled and violent. In the pitch black, his hand found mine, his fingers lacing through my own. The grip wasn't just for comfort; it was an anchor, a silent promise. Right there, with the world splintering apart just a few feet away, the warmth of his palm against mine felt like the only solid, real thing left.
