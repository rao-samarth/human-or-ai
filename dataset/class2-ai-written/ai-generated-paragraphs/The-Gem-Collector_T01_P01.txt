It’s truly marvelous, this city-wide stage production where everyone is the star of their own gritty, independent film. Just look at them, scurrying around in their carefully selected costumes. You’ve got the “creative professional” with his aggressively minimalist glasses and a laptop covered in ironic stickers, likely panicking about his rent. Over there, the "power executive" strides by, clutching a phone to her ear as if negotiating global peace, when she’s probably just arguing with a delivery service. What a collection of fabricated personalities. They all woke up this morning, selected an identity from a limited catalog of acceptable urban archetypes, and walked out the door, desperately hoping no one asks to see the receipts. It’s exhausting just to witness; a constant, frantic performance for an audience that’s too busy performing itself to even notice.
