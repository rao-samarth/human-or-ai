It wasn't one big thing that gave you away, you know. It was the little inconsistencies, the frayed edges of the story you told so carefully. You said you were at the library until it closed, a simple enough claim. But your car wasn't in its usual spot; it was parked two blocks over, facing away from downtown, as if you’d just returned from the industrial park. That alone was strange, but then you mentioned the rain. You were so certain it started late, well after ten. Except it didn't. The downpour began at nine-fifteen. Each detail by itself is nothing, a simple mistake. A forgotten parking spot, a misremembered time. But when you put them together, they stop being coincidences. They become corrections, pieces of an entirely different narrative, the one you were desperately trying to hide.
