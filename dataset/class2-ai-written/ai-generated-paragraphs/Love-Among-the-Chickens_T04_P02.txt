The string quartet just launched into a surprisingly screechy version of a pop song, the leaning tower of wedding cake is developing a new, more aggressive tilt, and I’m fairly certain the bride’s uncle is trying to start a conga line by himself. I glance over at him, and he’s calmly picking a stray piece of confetti from his drink, a look of profound, almost spiritual resignation on his face. It’s the same expression he wore during the great pigeon incident of ‘09 and the time our ‘foolproof’ camping tent spontaneously flooded in a light drizzle. He catches my eye and gives a nearly imperceptible shrug, a silent acknowledgment that yes, the universe has once again chosen us as the designated focal point for its absurdity. Some people collect stamps; we seem to collect catastrophic logistical failures. It’s a miracle anyone still invites us to these things, but honestly, it’s probably for the free entertainment.
