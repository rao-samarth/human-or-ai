I keep thinking about what we saw at the plaza. It wasn't the anger that got to me, but the strange sort of glee in it. No single person there would have had the nerve to shout those things alone, I'm sure of it. You could see it in their eyes when the group would momentarily quiet down—a flicker of individuality, maybe even shame. But then the chant would start again, and they would just dissolve back into this one big, faceless thing. It’s a comfortable kind of bravery, isn’t it? The kind that doesn’t require a spine because you’re borrowing pieces of a thousand others. Each person is just a single, anonymous pixel, and only when they’re all packed together do they form a picture of something truly ugly. It’s the anonymity they crave more than the cause.
