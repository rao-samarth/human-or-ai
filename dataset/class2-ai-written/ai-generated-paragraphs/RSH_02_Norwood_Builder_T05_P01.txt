My cousin, Sarah, quietly set down her fork. “But the statement says the only point of entry was a locked second-story window with no fire escape,” she said, her voice steady despite the sudden silence that fell over the table. “The lawn was untouched, no ladder marks. So how did they get up there?” David scoffed, his face tightening. “Look, the investigators know what they’re doing.” “I’m not questioning their experience,” Sarah replied, looking him directly in the eye. “I’m questioning the physics. The official story requires a ghost or a human fly. The logical explanation requires an unlocked door.” The air thickened, the cheerful chatter of the gathering completely gone, leaving only the sizzle of the grill and my uncle’s stunned, irritated silence.
