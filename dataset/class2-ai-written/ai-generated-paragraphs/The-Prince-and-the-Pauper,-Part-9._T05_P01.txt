The floorboard groaned from the kitchen, a sound that sliced through the midnight silence. Adrenaline hit like a jolt of ice water. I gripped the heavy Maglite from the nightstand, its metal cold and absolute, and crept down the stairs. A shadow flinched by the refrigerator. I flicked on the beam, pinning him against the stainless steel door. It was just a boy, barely sixteen, his eyes wide with terror, clutching a half-eaten loaf of bread. Every instinct screamed to call the cops, to follow the hard line of the law he’d so clearly broken. He was a trespasser, a thief. The rules were simple. But his thin frame trembled, and the ragged holes in his jacket spoke a different story than malice. I lowered the flashlight, its beam dropping to the floor. The hard line blurred. “Just finish the bread,” I said, my voice rougher than I intended. “Then get out.”
