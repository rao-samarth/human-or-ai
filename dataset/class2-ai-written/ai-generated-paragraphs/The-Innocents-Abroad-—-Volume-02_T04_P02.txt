The mayor’s final words on our town’s noble beginnings hang in the warm air, met with polite applause. He’s looking at me now, smiling, beckoning me to the podium for my turn. My prepared speech, the one filled with the usual platitudes about sacrifice and vision, feels like a lead weight in my jacket pocket. The real story is folded into a much smaller, crinkled piece of paper in my hand: a transcript of a letter from our celebrated founder detailing how he swindled his original partners and paid mercenaries to "convince" the native families to leave. It’s all there. The founding of this town wasn't a prayerful act of providence; it was a ruthless business transaction. I can feel the eyes of the whole town on me, people I've known my whole life, waiting for the comforting story they expect. Do I give them the pleasant fiction, or the ugly, documented truth that would poison this celebration forever?
