Mark’s voice was calm as he laid the blame for the entire system failure squarely on the new junior developer. My stomach tightened. I knew for a fact the kid had flagged this exact bug last week, but Mark had pushed the launch anyway, citing immovable deadlines. My cursor blinked on an empty document, my own voice caught in my throat. I could speak up. I had the chat logs saved, a clear record of the ignored warning. But a quick glance around the conference table told me everything I needed to know. Heads were down, eyes fixed on laptops, everyone suddenly fascinated by their own keyboards. Questioning Mark wasn't just a career misstep in this department; it was a career ending. You became the problem, the one who wasn't a team player. And so, I watched the junior developer’s face pale, a silent participant in the crushing of someone else, wondering if this quiet complicity was the only price for my own survival here.
