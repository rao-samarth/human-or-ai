The first rocket screamed into the night, and a hundred upturned faces were bathed in a fleeting, crimson glow. We stood shoulder to shoulder in the town square, the cobblestones still damp from the morning’s rain, smelling of wet earth and gunpowder. These were not the fireworks of an old holiday, a ghost of some forgotten king's birthday. This was new fire, our fire, bought with a price we were all still learning to name. I saw Mrs. Gable, her hand clutched over her heart, her eyes reflecting the bursting chrysanthemums of light. Beside her stood the Miller boy, his arm in a sling, a grimace softening into something like a smile. We were no longer just a collection of families on a map. The long, silent years of fear and the sudden, sharp violence that followed had burned away the trivial things that once divided us. In the explosive, echoing booms, a shared pulse was born. We were watching the sky, but we were really seeing each other, finally, as one.
