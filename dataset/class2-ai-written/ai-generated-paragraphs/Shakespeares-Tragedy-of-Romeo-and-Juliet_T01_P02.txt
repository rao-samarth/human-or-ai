The rage was a physical thing, a hot rock in his stomach. He was mentally composing a multi-point presentation on the complete societal collapse heralded by this single, agonizingly slow-moving taco truck line. Every person ahead of him was a villain in this epic tragedy of his lunch break. The guy with the top-knot? A fiend. The woman checking her phone? The architect of his misery. He was ready to renounce civilization and go live in a cave, subsisting on moss and spite. Then, a gentle poke in his side. He turned, ready to vaporize the offender, but it was just her, holding up a slightly squashed croissant she'd somehow procured from a nearby bakery. She wiggled her eyebrows, offering it like a diplomatic treaty. And just like that, the monumental, city-destroying fury deflated into nothing. He took a bite. It was buttery. He supposed civilization could stick around for another day.
