I used to be so quick to judge people at work. Take Mark from the sales team, for instance, who’s been quiet and missing his targets. A few years ago, I’d have privately labeled him as checked-out or just not pulling his weight. That was before my own big project went completely sideways, leaving me feeling like an absolute fraud for months. I remember that hollowed-out feeling, just trying to keep my head above water while acting like everything was fine. It’s a uniquely lonely kind of panic. Now, when I see Mark staring into his screen, I don’t see a slacker. I see the invisible battle. I recognize that frantic paddling beneath the calm surface that most people miss. You really have no idea what someone is silently navigating behind their polite "I'm good, thanks." It’s less about making excuses for him and more about just… seeing him.
