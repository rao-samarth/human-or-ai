Look, I’m not trying to be difficult, but this is anarchy. You can’t just… *place* things. The dishwasher has a system, a beautiful, logical system designed for optimal water circulation. You put the bowl facing up again. It’s now just a tiny, greasy pond. It's a choice you're making, a conscious decision to invite chaos into this kitchen. Every time you do this, you're not just creating more work for me; you're actively siding with entropy. You are siding with the slow, inevitable heat death of the universe, but starting with our cutlery. Is that really the legacy you want to leave behind? A legacy of poorly washed spoons and cosmic despair?
