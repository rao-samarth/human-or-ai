No, it was never about the money itself. That’s the easy answer, the one everyone wants to hear. It was the quiet, constant hum of a world I couldn’t access, even when I was standing right next to him. It was in the way he talked about the future as a guaranteed, pre-paved road, while mine was a frantic scramble through city streets just to make rent. I saw it in the eyes of his friends at those rooftop parties, a polite curiosity that never quite warmed into acceptance. They were looking at a novelty. An interesting story for a Saturday night. Every gift felt like a debt, every casual five-star dinner a reminder of the chasm between us. I wasn't his partner; I was his project, his brief escape from a life so cushioned he couldn’t even feel the edges. So I left. It was the only honest thing to do.
