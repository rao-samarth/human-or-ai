It’s a kindness, really, to make decisions for people when they can’t. After the funeral, her house was so still, you could practically hear the dust settling on all his old things. She just drifted from room to room, a ghost in her own kitchen. Someone had to be practical. I started in the study, with that collection of antique maps he was so proud of. She looked at them with this blank, hollow expression. "They're just paper," I said gently, "and a burden for you now." I told her I knew a specialist who might take them for a pittance, just to get them out of her way. Of course, I am the specialist. It’s better this way; she gets a clean space and a little cash for groceries, and the maps go to someone who actually appreciates their history. She wouldn't have understood their real value anyway, not in that state. It’s a mercy.
