Gary had been bragging for a week about his new automated lawnmower, the one with "advanced topographical mapping." He’d point his phone at it from his porch, feeling like a general commanding a very slow, very green army. The demonstration, however, took an unexpected turn.

It navigated the curb with a surprising jolt and proceeded directly towards the town square. A small crowd watched, frozen in a state of bemused horror, as it systematically mulched the mayor's wife's prize-winning petunias, leaving a trail of pink and purple confetti. Gary frantically tapped at his phone, shouting commands that were utterly ignored. After its rampage was complete, the machine calmly trundled back across the road, found its charging station with an obedient little whir, and blinked a single, satisfied green light.
