Mark in accounting always had the sharpest tie knot. His shoes were polished to a mirror shine, and his reports landed on my desk precisely at nine a.m. every Tuesday. Everyone saw him as a machine, a clockwork man who simply performed his function without error. But sometimes, when the office quieted down and the only sound was the hum of the servers, I'd see him just staring at the small, framed photo on his desk. He wouldn't be smiling or looking at it with fondness. He’d just stare, his shoulders slumping in a way his perfectly pressed suit couldn't quite hide. For that single, silent moment, the clockwork would stop, and you could almost hear the sound of a gear grinding, of something breaking very quietly inside.
