A real one, not that practiced curve he gives the ambassadors.” Her friend, a man grown weary of such galas, sighed and adjusted his stiff collar. “He can't afford real smiles in a room like this, Elara. Every expression is currency, every gesture a negotiation. The man who might want to kneel and thank the child is not the sovereign who must stand and be seen. He has to be a symbol, an unreadable page. What you saw was a flicker, a ghost. The moment he steps through those doors, he puts the man away in a box and leaves the crown on display.”
