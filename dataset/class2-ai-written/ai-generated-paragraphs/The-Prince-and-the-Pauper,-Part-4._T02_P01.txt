I was sitting in the food court, just trying to finish my lunch, and these two women at the next table were talking so loudly. They were going on about some guy in the news who got caught. One of them was all fire and brimstone, saying he deserved the harshest penalty possible, end of story. The other one, quieter, just kept asking, "but what was his life like?" I couldn't help but think about that. It’s so easy to just look at the final act, the broken rule, and call it a day. We have this idea that justice is a clean, sharp line. But it's not. If you don't even try to understand the desperation or the ignorance or the pain that might have pushed someone to that edge, then what are you even fixing? You’re not mending anything; you're just punishing. True fairness has to have a little bit of heart in it, a willingness to see the whole messy person and not just the crime.
