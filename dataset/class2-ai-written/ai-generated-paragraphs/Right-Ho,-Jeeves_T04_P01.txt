I couldn't help but overhear the woman at the table next to me, who was speaking into her phone with the kind of hushed urgency you'd reserve for a national emergency. Apparently, pigeons had taken up residence in the family dovecote. “No, not just any pigeons,” she was saying, her voice trembling slightly with what sounded like genuine distress. “Common, street pigeons. It’s mortifying.” There was a long, pained pause. “Of course they’re meant to be the pure white ones—it’s the same lineage we’ve had since the eighteenth century! With Allegra’s wedding next month, the photographers will be everywhere. We simply cannot have the optics of… that.” She then started discussing hiring a specialist, someone who could discretely ‘re-home’ the offenders without causing a scene. I just sat there stirring my coffee, trying to imagine a world where the wrong kind of bird could constitute a full-blown crisis.
