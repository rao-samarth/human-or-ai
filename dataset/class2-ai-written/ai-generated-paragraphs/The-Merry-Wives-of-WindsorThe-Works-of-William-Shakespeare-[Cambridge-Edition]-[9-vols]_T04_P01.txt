You keep saying I built a house of cards, and you’re right. But what choice did I have when the truth was buried under so much stone that no one could hear it screaming? So yes, I constructed a fiction, a careful lie designed to collapse in just the right way, bringing his whole fortress down with it. Every polite nod, every shared confidence, was just another piece of the trap. It was exhausting, living inside a story that wasn't mine, becoming a perfect mirror of the monster just to show everyone his reflection. And now he's gone. The world is safer, I suppose. They finally saw what he was. But the version of myself I had to create to make that happen is still there when I look in the mirror, and that’s a kind of prison no key can ever open.
