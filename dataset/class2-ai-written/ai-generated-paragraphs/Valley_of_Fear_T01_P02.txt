Even after four years, the walk to the post office felt like a trial. He kept his eyes fixed on the cracked pavement ahead, but he couldn't ignore the gap-toothed space where the hardware store used to be. It was just a vacant lot now, filled with stubborn weeds and the faint, dark scar of a foundation. He could feel the shift as he passed. Conversations on the sidewalk would stutter and die as he approached, only to resume in hushed tones once he was gone. He’d get polite nods from old neighbors, their smiles never quite reaching their eyes. He was no longer just a man; he was a story the town told itself, a permanent landmark just like the blackened lot. That single night was baked into the very bricks of the other buildings, a history he had to walk past every single day.
