The glow from the streetlamp sliced the living room in two, a lazy line of dust motes dancing in the beam. Everyone always screams for the rules, don’t they? They want the scales balanced, the i’s dotted, the pound of flesh carved out with a legally sanctioned knife. It’s all so beautifully simple on paper, a neat little equation where wrongdoing equals a precise measure of pain. But then you're standing there, in the quiet of your own house, and you realize the equation is nonsense. Following the letter of the law just creates two messes instead of one. So you let it go. Not out of some grand, enlightened forgiveness—that’s for greeting cards and daytime television. You do it because it’s easier, because the quiet that follows is worth more than the hollow satisfaction of being right.
