The self-checkout machine chirped at me with the kind of infuriating politeness usually reserved for hostage negotiators. “Unexpected item in the bagging area,” it declared, its voice a synthesized mockery of helpfulness. I looked at the single, offending bag of kale, then at the line of equally miserable souls behind me, each of us a star in this Beckett play we never auditioned for. The real comedy, of course, is that we chose this. We actively opted into this automated purgatory to save thirty seconds, a glorious half-minute now being sacrificed to the digital god of bagging area sensors. A man two spots back sighed with the force of a deflating zeppelin. You have to laugh. It’s either that or start weeping into your organic, locally sourced, unexpectedly problematic kale, and that would just be too much of a cliché for this masterpiece of modern suffering.
