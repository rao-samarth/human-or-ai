I had the news on in the background last night while I was washing dishes, and it’s a weird kind of whiplash. On the screen, you’ve got these pundits yelling about some political drama happening in a city I’ve never even visited, complete with urgent music and a ticker tape of disasters scrolling along the bottom. They make it sound like society is just one argument away from completely collapsing. But then I glance out my kitchen window and just see the quiet street, see Mr. Henderson walking his little terrier mix like he does every single night. The biggest story here isn't on their screen; it's the quiet worry about the downtown shops closing, or whether the council will finally approve the funding to fix the potholes on Maple Avenue. It feels like they aren’t reporting on the world anymore, just selling a product—and that product is constant, exhausting outrage.
