I was sitting near the window, watching the rain blur the streetlights into soft watercolor strokes. At the next table, a woman was laughing, her head tilted back just so. Her companion, a man in a crisp shirt, smiled a perfect, polished smile, his hand resting lightly on hers. They looked like a photograph from a magazine, a curated moment of effortless joy. Yet, I couldn't help but wonder about the silence in their car on the way here, or the carefully chosen words they use to avoid the topics that actually matter. We all learn to build such beautiful exteriors, like intricate dollhouses with meticulously arranged furniture. No one is meant to see the dust collecting in the corners or the hairline fractures spreading across the porcelain walls until the whole thing quietly threatens to collapse.
