Another airport departure lounge, another stunning display of human originality. Look at them all, milling about with their overpriced coffee and their carefully constructed identities. You can practically chart their entire childhood from a single glance: the man with the pristine carry-on who was clearly taught his needs were paramount, the young woman who has re-checked her ticket for the tenth time, apologizing to the air around her. People love to chatter about bloodlines and inherent traits, as if their DNA came with a pre-installed personality. What a joke. We’re all just slightly more sophisticated parrots, repeating the phrases and anxieties we were raised on, polished with a thin veneer of personal choice. Our passports might show where we were born, but our posture in the security line tells the whole, unglamorous story of how we were made.
