He stood there during his farewell, cake knife in hand, while the rest of us applauded. It was only a few months ago that he had sworn he would retire from this very department, a lifer through and through. We had all taken him at his word, building future plans around his constant presence. Yet here he was, leaving for an opportunity none of us, including him, could have predicted. Looking around at the smiling faces, I saw no bitterness, no sense of abandonment. It made me realize that the commitments we declare are not unbreakable contracts, but rather markers of a specific time and place. Maybe the strongest form of loyalty isn't about demanding permanence at all, but about genuinely celebrating someone's growth, even when it means saying goodbye. That shared happiness felt far more durable than any promise to stay put.
