“I’m just standing here, you know?” I whispered, leaning slightly toward him over the self-checkout counter. The machine, in its impossibly cheerful and yet utterly dead voice, kept repeating the same phrase about an unexpected item in the bagging area. “The only unexpected thing here is my will to live,” I muttered, carefully lifting the bag of onions as if it were a bomb, then placing it back down. Nothing. The red light just kept blinking, a tiny, judgmental pulse. A quiet, tired laugh escaped me. It felt strange in my own throat. “It’s like we’re in a terrible play where the antagonist is a faulty scale and it’s winning.” It’s not even anger anymore, just this profound sense of the ridiculous. We’re just tiny, soft-bodied creatures constantly being told to re-scan our groceries by a box that can't even recognize its own bags.
