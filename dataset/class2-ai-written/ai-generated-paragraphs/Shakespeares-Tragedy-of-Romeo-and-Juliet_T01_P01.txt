The smell of charcoal and cut grass was thick in the air, a backdrop of forced summer cheer. "You can't keep doing this," my brother said, his voice a low current beneath the sound of our cousins laughing. I didn't turn from the window, just watched our uncle flip burgers, oblivious. "Doing what? Enjoying the party?" The bitterness tasted like acid. He moved to stand beside me, close enough that I could feel the heat of his frustration. "No. Holding onto it. This… this rage. It's a weight, and you're dragging it through every room, expecting us all to help you carry it." I finally looked at him, at the genuine pain in his eyes. A younger, weaker part of me wanted to crumble, to let his appeal wash it all away. But the anger had become a fortress, and its walls were the only thing that felt real anymore. "It's all I have left," I whispered. He shook his head slowly, the hope draining from his face. "No, it's not. It's just all you'll allow yourself to have."
