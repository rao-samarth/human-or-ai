It’s strange, the things you think about when the house is finally quiet. My mind keeps drifting back to my aunt, of all people. For years, she was just the one who brought the Jell-O salad to potlucks and told long, rambling stories about her cats. We all kind of saw her as sweet but a bit… peripheral. Then my grandfather got sick, and the whole family dynamic just shattered. While everyone else was either panicking or bickering over who should do what, she just stepped in. No drama, no announcement. She coordinated the doctor visits, managed his impossible medication schedule, and just sat with him, holding his hand. She became the quiet, unshakable pillar we all ended up leaning on. I never looked at her, or her Jell-O salads, the same way again.
