I can hear the couple at the next table, just snippets of their conversation over the hiss of the espresso machine. They’re talking about a new community garden project, the kind of thing you see praised in local newspapers. He has a kind face, and she laughs with such easy warmth. It's all so perfectly polished, so admirable. And that's what always gets me, the realization that the most profound harm is rarely done by cackling villains in the dark but by people just like them, people who build such beautiful, impenetrable walls of good deeds and public grace around their private rot. Their reputations are their fortresses. Every charity gala attended, every polite interview given, is just another stone in the wall. You could spend a lifetime admiring the architecture and never once think to ask what’s starving in the dungeon.
