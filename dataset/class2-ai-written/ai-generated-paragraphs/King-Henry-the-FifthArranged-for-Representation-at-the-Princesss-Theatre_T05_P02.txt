You look at me and you still search for the person I was. You want the man who could laugh without first checking the corners of the room, who could weep and have it be called grief instead of weakness. That man is a ghost. He is a story I tell myself some nights before sleep. Every decision, every single breath I take, is no longer my own. It belongs to the seal on my desk, to the weight of this office, to the thousands of faces I will never meet but whose fates rest on my signature. You ask me to feel, to be human. Don't you understand what a dangerous luxury that is? To feel is to hesitate, and to hesitate is to let everything crumble. So please, stop looking for the man. He would burn this world to the ground for one moment of peace. The one who remains must build with the ashes.
