The chaotic symphony of my family reunion was a world away from the silent hum of my cubicle. Here, laughter bounced off the patio as my cousin told a rambling story, a sharp contrast to the endless cycle of performance reviews and synergy meetings that defined my weekdays. For so long, I had felt like I was just ticking off boxes on a project plan that led absolutely nowhere, a slow march through a sea of gray. But as my uncle handed me a cold drink, asking about *me* and not my deliverables, something inside me shifted. I looked around at the messy, vibrant, unpredictable life happening all around us. I realized the job, with its predictable rhythm and muted colors, wasn't the whole picture. It was just the frame. And suddenly, that frame seemed so much smaller, making the canvas of my actual life feel beautifully vast and full of brilliant potential again.
