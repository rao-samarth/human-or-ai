The announcements over the loudspeaker were in a language I didn’t understand, just a murmur of sound in the cavernous bus terminal. I watched people greet their families with hugs and tears, their journeys ending. Mine felt like it was just beginning, even though I had been on the road for weeks. There was a time I believed in processes, in filing the right papers and speaking to the right people. I thought the world was built on a foundation of consequences that applied to everyone equally. But some actions create a debt that no court can ever truly collect. So you learn to become your own ledger, your own collector. It’s a lonely job, sitting in the half-light of a station far from home, waiting for the right connection to settle an old account.
