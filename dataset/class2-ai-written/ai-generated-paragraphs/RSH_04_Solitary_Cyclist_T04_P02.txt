The only sound in the house was the soft, rhythmic breathing of the sleeping child. Outside the window, beyond the familiar silhouette of the oak tree, other shapes stood. They were tall and thin, patient figures who seemed woven from the deeper parts of the night itself. They did not move. Their silent attention was fixed on the small bedroom, a constant, unwavering vigil against things that slithered in the forgotten spaces and whispered from the vents. The child, dreaming of simple things like crayons and sunshine, knew nothing of this nightly watch. It was a duty performed without thanks or recognition, a quiet pact made with the stillness, ensuring the house and its small heart would see the morning.
