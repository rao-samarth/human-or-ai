The wind combs through the tall grass, and for a moment, it’s just wind and grass. Then the other thing returns, the story they all believe. It feels like a physical structure, a wall built from their confident nods and shared glances, and my own truth is just a handful of sand thrown against it. So I sit here, away from their eyes, and I rebuild that day piece by piece. I search for the one detail they twisted, the one timeline that doesn't quite fit. A single, loose stone in their fortress of a lie. It's an exhausting, lonely kind of work, chipping away at something so solid. But a lie, no matter how grand, is never seamless. Somewhere, there has to be a crack. I just have to find it before it all hardens into fact.
