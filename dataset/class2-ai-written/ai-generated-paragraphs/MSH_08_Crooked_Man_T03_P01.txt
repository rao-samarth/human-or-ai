Look, I just have to say it, because it’s been eating me alive for two decades. You know your prize-winning, impossibly neurotic parrot, Percy? The one you swore flew out an open window back in ‘03? He didn’t. I was eight, and I was trying to teach him the macarena, and he just… wasn’t getting the wing-to-head part. He got so agitated he had a, well, what the vet later called a “fatal cardiac event.” I buried him near the old oak tree. The silence in the room became a physical weight. My uncle’s face, which had been a healthy shade of beige, cycled through an alarming spectrum of pale, to grey, to a sort of vibrant mauve. He opened his mouth, made a small squawking sound of his own, and then pitched forward into his bowl of gazpacho. I had rehearsed this moment a thousand times, preparing for yelling or even disinheritance, but never for this. It seems Percy, in the end, got his revenge.
