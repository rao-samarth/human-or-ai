The whole disaster began with the latte, a scalding geyser erupting down his new white shirt as a pedestrian jostled his elbow. He stumbled back, directly into a man balancing a precarious pyramid of gourmet cupcakes. Pink frosting met beige trench coat in a disastrous, sugary collision that sent a nearby cyclist swerving wildly to avoid the carnage. The cyclist, in turn, clipped a street mime who was, with great theatrical effort, trying to escape an invisible box. A true professional, the mime folded rigidly at the waist and toppled onto a poodle’s diamante leash, snapping it instantly. The now-liberated poodle, with the fury of a tiny, fluffy god of vengeance, latched onto his trouser leg and refused to let go. He just stood there, a sticky, coffee-stained monument to bad luck, as the first cold drops of an inevitable downpour began to fall.
