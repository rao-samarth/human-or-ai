My uncle was showing off his new watch, a gleaming silver thing he absolutely couldn’t afford. He’d been borrowing money from my parents for months, spinning stories of bad luck and worse timing. Across the room, his sister—my aunt—flashed a tight, unconvincing smile. I watched her fidget with her empty ring finger, the skin beneath it still pale and indented where her wedding band used to be. A tiny, almost imperceptible shake in her hand. Her husband was laughing by the fireplace, oblivious. And my uncle’s wife, supposedly home with the flu, hadn’t answered a single text all day. Each piece was small on its own, but together they formed a sharp, ugly picture right in the middle of the cheerful living room. I looked at my dad, who was clapping his brother on the back, and felt a cold knot tighten in my stomach. To say something would be to light a match.
