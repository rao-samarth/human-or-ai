I stood by the marble pillar, watching the a-listers mingle. Everyone was so impeccably dressed, laughing over flutes of champagne and tiny, unidentifiable appetizers. It all looked so civilized, so refined. But as I listened to the snippets of conversation—hostile takeovers dressed up as "synergy," rivals being subtly undermined—I realized something. This was just a cleaner, more polite version of a turf war. The impulse to take, to accumulate, to dominate another's territory for your own gain… it’s the same basic drive that makes someone pick up a weapon. The suits and ties are just armor, and the contracts are the new clubs. We condemn the brutal conflicts we see on the news, but the engine that drives them is humming along nicely right here, just with better table manners. It’s the same hunger, just served on a silver platter.
