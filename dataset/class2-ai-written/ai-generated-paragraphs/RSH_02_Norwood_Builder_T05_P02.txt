The patrol’s final radio call had been clear: a total communications blackout across the valley, the main relay tower a dead spike of steel against the twilight. They’d called it a regional failure, a problem for the morning crew, an accepted fact. But they were wrong. From my vantage point on the far ridge, a pinprick of crimson light pulsed where there should have been only darkness. It wasn't the steady, automated blink of an aircraft warning. It was deliberate, frantic. A repeating, desperate pattern. Someone was up there, manually triggering the beacon, screaming a silent message into the quiet hills. The official assumption was that we were cut off and helpless, waiting for rescue. My boots were already laced; logic demanded I answer the call.
