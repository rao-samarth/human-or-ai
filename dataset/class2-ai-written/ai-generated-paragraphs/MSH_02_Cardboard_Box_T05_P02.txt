It’s three in the morning, and the house is finally still. The silence is a heavy blanket, thicker and more suffocating than the shouting that came before it. I walk through the rooms and it feels like touring the ruins of something that was once whole. There’s the dent in the hallway wall from a slammed door, a small but permanent scar. In the kitchen, a half-finished glass of water sits on the counter, abandoned mid-argument. We all just retreated to our separate corners, didn't we? It’s funny how a home, a place meant for shelter, can become the very thing you need to escape from. The foundation feels fractured, and I worry that one more tremor will bring the whole thing down on top of us.
