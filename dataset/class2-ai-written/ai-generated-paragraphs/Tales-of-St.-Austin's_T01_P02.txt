The air cooled as the last light drained from the fields, and for a long time, neither of us felt the need to speak. It was a stark contrast to the relentless noise of our adolescence, a time when every moment had to be filled with chatter or a shared joke. What's curious is not that we've changed, but how the underlying connection has adapted. We no longer chronicle our daily lives for each other; the logistical details have become secondary. Instead, the rapport operates on a deeper, more efficient level. It's a conversation that has been running in the background for two decades, and when we meet, we simply check in on the main plot points, confident that the fundamental architecture of the other person remains understood. The shared history isn't a collection of anecdotes anymore; it’s the quiet, solid ground beneath our feet.
