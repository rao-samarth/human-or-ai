You really should see this. The whole living room is glowing, full of laughter. Uncle Mike just told that same old story about the fishing trip, and everyone is roaring as if they’ve never heard it. But I saw him in the driveway an hour ago, just sitting in his car with the engine off, and his face looked like a stone. Now he’s playing the part of the happy-go-lucky patriarch, and Aunt Susan is smiling at him, a perfect porcelain doll of a smile, even though I know they haven't had a real conversation in weeks. It’s incredible, really. The amount of energy in this room dedicated not to connection, but to maintaining the beautiful, fragile illusion of it. We are all such excellent actors, holding the whole thing together with nothing but polite questions and carefully managed cheer.
