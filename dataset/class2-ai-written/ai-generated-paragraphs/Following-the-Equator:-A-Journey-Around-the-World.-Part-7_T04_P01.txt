The deep tremor of the organ vibrated through the stone floor, a physical presence in the incense-thick air. All around me, people were utterly lost to the moment. A woman to my left, her expensive coat forgotten on the pew, swayed with her eyes squeezed shut, her face a mask of ecstatic pain as she sang. Her voice was not beautiful, but it was raw and real, a sound torn from a place of profound need. In front of her, a man knelt so rigidly he might have been carved from the same granite as the pillars, his knuckles white as he gripped the rail. There was no performance here, no self-consciousness in the way bodies shuddered with the rising crescendo of the choir. It was a complete, almost violent surrender, every individual soul pouring itself out to dissolve into a single, thrumming wave of absolute conviction that left me feeling like a ghost, a witness to a fire I could not feel.
