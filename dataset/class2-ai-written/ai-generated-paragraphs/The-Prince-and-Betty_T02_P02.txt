It’s a different kind of inheritance, isn't it? Over there, they build upon the foundations of a thousand years, following a pattern laid down by ghosts. Each choice is a conversation with the dead, a careful step to avoid disrespecting an ancestor’s design. Here, the foundation is just the problem we need to solve today. We aren’t burdened by the proper way to build the arch; we just need the bridge to stand. Some see that as a profound loss, a disconnection from meaning. They think our solutions are hollow because they lack the weight of precedent. But maybe it’s just a different kind of creation. We're not continuing a story already written. We're just finding the first words.
