He used to be one of us, sitting on the porch steps, talking about how he’d fix things. He promised to save the old mill and keep the developers out of Miller's Woods. Everyone believed him; we all voted for him. Then, slowly, things started to change. The first sign was the closed-door meetings. Then came the rezoning proposal that nobody understood until it was too late. Now, the mill is gone, replaced by a soulless distribution center that choked out the local shops. He doesn't sit on porches anymore. He drives through town in a car with tinted windows, his face a mask. He got what he wanted—a bigger stage, a louder voice—but the cost was everything we were. He sees a city on a hill, but down here, we just see the shadows he cast to get there.
