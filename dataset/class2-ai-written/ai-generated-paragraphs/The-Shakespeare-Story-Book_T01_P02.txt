The countryside blurs into a single green smear from the train window, each town a momentary flicker before it’s gone. People are much the same, I’ve found. You meet them, you assess their utility, and then you move past them at speed. Some of them wave as you go, others try to cling on, but it’s not my fault they chose to stand still. You have to be the one in motion. My old mentor used to talk about building bridges, about collaboration. What a waste of time. Bridges are for people who want to go back. I find it’s far more efficient to simply learn how to swim and then let the current do its work, pulling you away from the wreckage you had to make to get free. This city ahead is just another shore, another starting point for the next crossing.
