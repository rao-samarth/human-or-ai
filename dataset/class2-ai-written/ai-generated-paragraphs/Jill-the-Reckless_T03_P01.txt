My Uncle Ron, bless his impulsive heart, decided this was the year to deep-fry the Christmas goose. He'd seen a video online. That was the extent of his research. While the rest of us huddled by the window, clutching mugs of mulled wine and muttering about fire extinguishers, he was out on the frozen patio with a giant vat of bubbling oil and a bird the size of a toddler. My aunt was already dialing the non-emergency line, just in case. There was a terrifyingly large splash, a plume of steam that momentarily blocked out the sun, and then… silence. We all held our breath. A minute later, Ron emerged from the fog, holding the tongs aloft like a scepter. The goose was impossibly, perfectly golden brown. It was a greasy, glorious, and utterly idiotic triumph, proving that sometimes the best-laid plans are the ones you never bothered to make in the first place.
