Look, I know how this appears, but you have to understand the sequence of events. The coats were identical—black cashmere, both of them—and I simply grabbed the wrong one from the cloakroom. I didn’t realize my mistake until I felt the squirming in the pocket, and by then it was too late. A ferret, a live ferret, shot out of the lining and made a direct line for the dessert table. What was I supposed to do? I gave chase. People were gasping, I think someone dropped a canapé, but all I could see was this furry torpedo heading for that seven-tiered lemon chiffon masterpiece. My final lunge was, in hindsight, a monumental miscalculation. I missed the animal completely. I did not, however, miss the cake, or the Chief Financial Officer who was unfortunately standing right behind it.
