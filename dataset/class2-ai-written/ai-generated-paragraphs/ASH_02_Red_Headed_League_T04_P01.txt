I was trying to tune them out, honestly, the two guys at the table next to me in the coffee shop. They had that generic corporate look – crisp shirts, expensive watches, talking in a low murmur about 'optimizing asset streams' and 'sunsetting legacy portfolios.' It was just background noise, the usual buzz of downtown business. But then one of them laughed, a quiet, dry little sound, and said something about how the final 'depopulation' would be cleaner than the last one. His partner nodded, sipping his latte, and mentioned that once the digital records were 'migrated to a non-existent server,' the whole pension fund would become a ghost. They weren't just moving numbers around. I suddenly understood they were describing the methodical, bloodless ruin of thousands of lives, all planned out on a napkin between sips of coffee. They just looked like two men discussing another day at the office.
