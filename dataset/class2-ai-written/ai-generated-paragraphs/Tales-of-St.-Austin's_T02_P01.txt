The fields blurring past the train window remind me of the crushing silence of the school library. Our librarian patrolled the aisles like a hawk, her stare promising detention for a single misplaced cough. She worshipped order. So, of course, we had to disrupt it. We’d planned it for a week, a silent, coordinated rebellion conducted through glances and tiny nods. The signal was a subtle pen tap from the back corner. Then, at once, a dozen of us let our heavy textbooks slip from our desks. The unified *thump* was an earthquake in that cathedral of quiet. Her head snapped up, eyes scanning for a single culprit, but she found only a sea of perfectly innocent faces staring back at their pages. It was nothing, really, but in that moment, stifling our shared, soundless laughter, we felt like we’d conquered the world.
