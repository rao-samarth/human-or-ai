They're serving the good champagne tonight, the kind that costs more than some people’s rent. Henderson is holding court by the ice sculpture, laughing that ridiculous, booming laugh of his. He still thinks this is all about loyalty and handshakes over golf, that a business is a family. He doesn’t understand that an enterprise is a machine, and sentimentality is just rust gumming up the gears. He has no idea that every polite smile he receives is a carefully placed stone in the wall we’re building around him. Maria catches my eye from her table, the barest flicker of a nod. We aren't villains; we’re simply realists. Someone has to steer the ship toward a richer port, and it might as well be the ones who understand you sometimes have to throw the sentimental cargo overboard to get there first.
