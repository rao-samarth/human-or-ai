You have to admire the sheer audacity of it, don't you? First, they arrive and inform you that your gods are imaginary, your language is barbaric, and your entire way of life is a rather charming but inefficient hobby. Then, a century or two later, after the dust has settled, they build a climate-controlled building to display your ‘priceless artifacts.’ They write little explanatory cards about the profound spiritual meaning of the very masks their grandfathers paid your grandfathers to burn. It’s the ultimate victory lap, really. They don't just get to win; they get to own the memory of what they erased. They call it cultural exchange, or maybe preservation. But look closer. It’s just the art of arranging a crime scene and then charging admission.
