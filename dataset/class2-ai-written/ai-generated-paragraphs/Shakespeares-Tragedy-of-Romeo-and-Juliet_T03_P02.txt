The only light in here is from the phone on the coffee table, a screen I wish I could un-write. It took maybe ten seconds to type it all out, my thumbs a blur of pure, stupid rage that felt so justified in the moment. Now, hours later, the silence in the apartment is deafening. I keep picking it up and putting it down, half-hoping for a reply and half-terrified of what it might say. It’s absurd, really, how a few carelessly chosen words sent in a little blue bubble can feel like pulling a pin on a grenade. A five-minute walk around the block would have changed everything. But I didn’t take the walk. I just hit send, and now all I can do is sit in the fallout.
