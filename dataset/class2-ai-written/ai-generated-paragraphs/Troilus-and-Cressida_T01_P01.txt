The small wooden horse felt the same as it always had, smooth and cool in my palm, its one remaining ear worn down by years of mindless thumbing. It had sat on my grandmother's bedside table. But the number the appraiser had given me this afternoon kept echoing in the quiet kitchen: four thousand dollars. It felt like an absurd joke, a clerical error. This was just a cheap carving, a silly trinket she’d loved. Now, it was a down payment. It was the new furnace we desperately needed. I tried to see it as I had this morning—a simple, comforting link to a person I missed—but the number was superimposed over it, glowing like a price tag. It wasn't just a memory anymore; it was an asset. And I hated what that knowledge had done, turning something priceless into something that merely had a price.
