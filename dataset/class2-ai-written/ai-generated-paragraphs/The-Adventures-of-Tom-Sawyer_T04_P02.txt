I love how you can just disappear here. Standing in this sea of strangers on the subway, it hits me how different it is from back home, where 'community' was just a prettier word for a high-stakes performance. Everyone knew the town’s most upstanding citizen had a secret gambling problem, but we all had to pretend it was a masterpiece of moral theater. You’d get praised at the potluck for your casserole by the same woman who’d later dissect your daughter’s wardrobe choices over the phone with three other pillars of the church. It was a suffocating sort of intimacy, a constant, low-grade surveillance disguised as caring. Here, nobody gives a damn if my recycling is sorted correctly or who I was with last night. The indifference is a kind of freedom, and honestly, it feels a lot more sincere than all those Sunday morning smiles ever did.
