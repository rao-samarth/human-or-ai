Look, I admit it. I went around the official channels. The ten-step approval process, the one practically handwritten on parchment and framed in the founder’s office? I skipped all of it. I built a predictive model over a weekend. It was just a few lines of code, nothing fancy, but it gave us the same answer in seconds that their committee takes months to debate. Was it disrespectful? Maybe. I didn't get the required signatures from every department head, and I certainly didn't wait for the ceremonial sign-off. But the data was clear, and the market doesn't wait for ceremony. My action wasn't an attack on our history; it was simply a response to our reality. You can honor the past without being trapped by it, and sometimes the most pragmatic solution is the one that doesn't ask for permission.
