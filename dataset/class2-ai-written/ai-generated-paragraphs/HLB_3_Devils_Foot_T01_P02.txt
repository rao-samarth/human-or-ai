The string quartet is playing something classical and entirely forgettable, a perfect soundtrack for this whole charade. I watch my brother clap our uncle on the back, a big, false smile plastered on his face. He's probably calculating the value of the man's cufflinks. My sister is over by the bar, laughing a little too loudly with a cousin we both despise, likely trying to gauge who's siding with whom. It’s been six months since the reading of the will, and the battle lines are still sharply drawn, invisible threads of animosity crisscrossing this polished ballroom floor. We’re all here, dressed in our finest, pretending we’re a family celebrating a milestone. But we’re not. We’re just a collection of warring shareholders who happen to share a bloodline, each of us wondering how much the others stand to gain and what we ourselves have already lost.
