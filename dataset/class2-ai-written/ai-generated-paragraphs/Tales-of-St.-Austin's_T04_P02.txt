My collar felt like it was actively trying to strangle me, and I was pretty sure my shoes were a full size too small. Then my dad cornered me by the dessert table, his voice low and serious. He gestured with his head toward the mantelpiece, where a little porcelain bird now lay in two pieces. He wanted to know if my friend had done it, and he knew we’d been goofing around over there earlier. I looked my own father in the eye, felt that familiar knot of guilt, and just shrugged. I mumbled something about being in the kitchen getting a drink, that I hadn't seen a thing. Across the room, he caught my gaze for half a second. It wasn't relief or even gratitude in his expression; it was just an understanding. A silent confirmation of a law that was older and more important to us than any house rule. We didn't need to talk about it, but we both knew I'd just passed the only test that mattered.
