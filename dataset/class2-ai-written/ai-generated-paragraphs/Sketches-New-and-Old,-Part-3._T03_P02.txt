I suppose I always knew it wouldn’t live up to the blueprint. In those early meetings, we spoke in grand terms, sketching out architectural marvels on the whiteboard, convinced we were building a new kind of cathedral for the industry. We sold ourselves on that vision, the one with sweeping arches and a skyline-altering silhouette. But a project isn’t an idea. It’s a thousand tiny compromises. It’s a Monday morning where a crucial support beam is suddenly out of budget, and a Wednesday afternoon where a foundational team member quits. Slowly, without one single moment of collapse, the cathedral became a functional warehouse. It stands, it serves its purpose, and the lights turn on. But when you ask me why there is no soaring ceiling, no sense of awe, I can only say that we used all our energy just to keep the roof from caving in.
