The hardest part isn't their whispers or the way their eyes slide away from mine in the kitchen; it's the sheer, grinding labor of it all. I've spent every waking hour outside of meetings retracing my own digital steps, a detective in a crime I didn't commit. My calendar, my sent emails, the server access logs—it’s all a blur of timestamps and file names. I'm searching for an alibi in a mountain of mundane data. They say the burden of proof is on the accuser, but that’s a lie. The real weight falls on you, forcing you to meticulously reconstruct your own reality just to show you were somewhere else, doing something else, being someone else when the damage was done. It’s a quiet, lonely battle fought on a spreadsheet, and I just have to believe that somewhere in this ocean of ones and zeroes is the single entry that will set me free.
