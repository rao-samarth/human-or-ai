The late afternoon sun slanted across the long grass, turning everything a soft, hazy gold. From this old stone wall, the world feels impossibly quiet. It used to be that you would think of people as separate stories, each with a loud beginning and a final, sharp end. But here, that's not how it feels. The farmer who laid these stones a century ago is in the stillness of them. The child who chased a butterfly through this very field is in the warmth of the light. Even those who never saw such a place, who lived and died surrounded by noise and steel, are here now. Their hopes and their quiet despairs have settled, becoming part of the same low hum as the insects in the weeds. There are no grand arrivals, no final judgments, just this slow, peaceful joining into the landscape itself.
