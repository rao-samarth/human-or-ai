I was wandering through a small square on my way back to the hotel today and came across a pickup soccer match that you would have loved. The intensity was incredible; these guys were playing for keeps on a dusty patch of ground, arguing every call with passionate gestures and flying into tackles with total commitment. It all came down to one penalty kick at the end. The kid who took it missed, hitting the post, and you could just see the devastation on his face as the other team erupted in celebration. But then something happened. The winning team's goalie, instead of joining his celebrating teammates, walked straight to the kid who missed. He helped him up, put an arm around his shoulder, and they walked off the pitch together. It was a quiet moment everyone else missed, but it was the most impressive play of the entire game.
