You have to understand, I thought it was gone for good. I buried it so deep I almost convinced myself it never happened. For years, it worked. I built a whole new life on top of that ground, carefully, piece by piece. I told myself that enough time and distance could erase anything, that you could simply walk away and become someone else entirely. But it was always there, I see that now. It wasn't buried; it was just dormant, a seed waiting for the right conditions to finally grow. And now it’s pushing up through the floorboards of everything I’ve constructed. I can hear the wood creaking under the strain. All those years, all that effort, and for what? It’s back. And it’s looking at me through your eyes.
