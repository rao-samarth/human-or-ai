The bus lurched, and for a moment, his reflection in the grimy window superimposed itself over the passing street. He saw a stranger wearing his face, a ghost haunting the vibrant chaos of the afternoon. Outside, a couple laughed, heads thrown back, sharing a single cone of ice cream. A block later, a musician tuned a guitar on a park bench, lost in a melody only he could hear. Each small, unscripted scene was a life he could have chosen, a different version of himself living freely under the same sun. But his own path had been set long ago, a straight line drawn through this sprawling map of possibilities. He felt the weight of it not as a burden, but as a quiet, hollow ache—the phantom limb of a future he had willingly amputated for a promise made to others. The doors hissed open at his stop, and the ghost in the glass vanished.
