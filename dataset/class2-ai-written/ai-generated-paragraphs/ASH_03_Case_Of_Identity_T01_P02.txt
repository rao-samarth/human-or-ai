"So that's all it is, then?" I finally said, my voice barely rising above the hum of the office air conditioning. Across the desk, Mark’s reassuring smile didn’t waver for a second. It was the same polished, confident expression he’d given me that morning after I’d shared my concerns about the project, the same one he offered everyone like a business card. "I'm not sure what you mean," he replied, his tone smooth as polished stone. "I only said what was best for the team." My hands tightened on the folder I was holding. Best for the team? I’d just come from a meeting where he’d presented my confidential worries as his own proactive insights, positioning himself as the cautious leader while making me look like a liability. He was a master of it—building his platform with the bricks he’d carefully pulled from everyone else's walls, all while maintaining the faultless image of a supportive colleague.
