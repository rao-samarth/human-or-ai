The evening light painted the street in a soft, forgiving gold, just like in the postcards they sold at the general store. Mrs. Gable was watering her prize-winning roses, smiling at everyone who passed, and the laughter of children playing tag echoed from a nearby lawn. It was a perfect picture, a carefully constructed stage play where everyone knew their lines. But I knew better now. I saw the cracks in the paint, the strain behind that perfect smile. I knew her husband hadn't been home in three nights. I saw the foreclosure notice peeking from the mail slot next door, a secret the Hendersons kept behind drawn curtains and forced cheerfulness. This whole town was built on such secrets, a fragile consensus to pretend. We were all actors, mouthing words of contentment while a desperate, lonely ache hummed just beneath the surface, a sound no one dared to acknowledge.
