He shoved the phone under my nose, the screen a cold, blue light against the deepening twilight of the city street. “Explain it, then,” he demanded, his voice dangerously low amidst the blare of horns and the rush of pedestrians. “Every message, every timestamp, it all leads back to you. There’s nowhere left for you to hide.” I could feel the indifferent crowd bumping against my shoulders, trapping me in his orbit of suspicion. I shook my head, my own voice thin against the urban chaos. "You’re not seeing the whole picture. You're looking at shadows on a wall and calling them the real thing. There is one detail, one tiny, impossible detail they didn't count on, and I can find it. You just have to stop looking at that screen and actually look at *me*. You have to trust me for five more minutes."
