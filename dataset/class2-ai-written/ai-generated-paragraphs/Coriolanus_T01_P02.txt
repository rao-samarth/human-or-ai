I sit here listening to them at the next table, all buzzing energy and grand plans for their little startup. I was like that once. I was the one people leaned in to hear, the one whose vision was called “singular.” I loved that word. It felt like a shield, a confirmation that I was right and everyone else was just noise. My own team tried to warn me, of course. They brought spreadsheets and market data, pointing to all the little red flags I dismissed as cowardice. But what did they know? They were just technicians executing my grand design. I was the architect. I saw the whole cathedral. Or so I believed. Now, surrounded by the ruins, I see it was all because I couldn't bear to admit that maybe, just maybe, the architect had drawn the blueprints upside down from the very beginning.
