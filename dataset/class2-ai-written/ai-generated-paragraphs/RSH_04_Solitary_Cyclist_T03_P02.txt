The champagne is cheap, but the smiles are expensive. I watch them cluster in their little groups, a constellation of tailored suits and calculated laughter. They think no one sees the real transaction happening behind the polite inquiries about family and vacations. It’s a silent auction of favors. A little regulatory nudge here for a board seat there; a hushed promise of inside information exchanged for future loyalty. It’s not some grand, malevolent plot hatched in a secret chamber, it’s much simpler and more mundane than that. It’s just a collection of individual appetites, all pointing in the same direction. They align not out of shared ideology, but from a shared, unspoken hunger for accumulation. Each handshake is a signature on an unwritten contract, a quiet agreement to maintain the system that feeds them all so well. Everyone knows the rules, and the first rule is that there’s always more to be had.
