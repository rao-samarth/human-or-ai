The crystal glass felt like a prop in her hand, a small, cold weight in a room buzzing with polite murmurs and the distant melody of a string quartet. She offered a smile to a passing acquaintance, a gesture so practiced it was automatic, a reflex of the person everyone here believed her to be. For years, the partition in her mind had been absolute, a solid wall separating this polished life from the messy, vibrant truth of her other one. The constant vigilance was exhausting. But tonight, watching the genuine, unburdened laughter of a group near the orchestra, a different feeling bloomed in her chest. It wasn't the usual knot of anxiety, but a quiet, powerful sense of possibility. The fear of both worlds colliding, once a constant terror, suddenly seemed less important than the freedom of no longer being split in two. She could build a bridge instead of a wall. The thought was liberating, a slow, deep breath that promised a new, singular existence.
