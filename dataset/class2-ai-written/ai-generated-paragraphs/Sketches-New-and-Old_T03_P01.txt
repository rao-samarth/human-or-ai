The town council spent a fortune on the Downtown Vibrancy Initiative, a plan masterminded by a consultant who clearly believed our main problem was a lack of uncomfortable benches. So now we have them, sleek metal slabs strategically placed to discourage loitering, or sitting, or comfort of any kind. We also have a series of "smart" trash cans that require a smartphone app to open, a brilliant solution for a town where cell service is a hopeful rumor. The centerpiece is the new digital information kiosk, which has been frozen on its boot-up screen since the ribbon-cutting ceremony. They assured us this would drive engagement and create a dynamic, forward-thinking public space. Meanwhile, the pothole outside the pharmacy has grown large enough to be zoned as a residential pond, but at least our garbage is secure and our empty town square is officially vibrant.
