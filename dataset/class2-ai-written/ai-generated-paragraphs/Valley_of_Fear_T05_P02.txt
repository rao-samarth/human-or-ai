My uncle clapped me on the shoulder, his booming voice dredging up a nickname I thought had been buried years ago. The story that followed was a familiar one, full of youthful recklessness and poor decisions. A few years back, the anecdote would have landed like a punch, a sharp reminder of the person I fought so hard not to be. I would have felt the familiar heat creeping up my neck, the urge to correct the record or just disappear. But standing here, with my partner’s hand finding mine and the smell of grilled burgers in the air, I just laughed along with everyone else. It was strange. The story wasn't about me anymore; it was about a kid I used to know. The memories no longer had sharp edges. For the first time, I felt the space between who I was and who I am, and it was a clean, sunlit expanse.
