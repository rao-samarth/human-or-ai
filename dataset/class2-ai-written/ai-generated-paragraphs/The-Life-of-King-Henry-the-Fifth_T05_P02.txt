There you go again, spinning that beautiful story where we all march together toward some glorious horizon. And you do it so well; your voice drops, your eyes shine, and for a moment, everyone forgets the cost. They forget the quiet compromises and the people left behind. You make it sound like destiny, like a noble cause we are all privileged to serve. But I see it now for what it is. It isn't a map to a better world; it's a net. Every grand promise, every call to unity, is just another thread you use to bind us to your will, to make us ignore the wreckage you create in the name of progress. Your words don't build bridges, they build cages—gilded, magnificent cages we are made to love.
