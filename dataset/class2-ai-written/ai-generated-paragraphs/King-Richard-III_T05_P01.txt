You think the silence would be a relief, but it’s not. It’s where the memory lives, where it breathes. I see them all the time, of course. This town isn't big enough to hide in. At the diner, by the war memorial. They’ll offer a small, sad smile, and for a second, I forget they’re smiling at the person they *think* I am. That’s the worst part. The performance. I’ve rehearsed the story so many times it feels more real than what actually happened on that road. But the truth has a weight to it, a physical presence that sits in the car with me and follows me home from work. You can’t outrun something that’s already inside you, living behind your own eyes.
