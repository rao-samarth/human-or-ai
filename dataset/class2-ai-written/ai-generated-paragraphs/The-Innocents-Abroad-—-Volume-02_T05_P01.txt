The little carved boat sits on the bookshelf, gathering a fine layer of dust under the lamplight. I remember the frantic energy of that market, the press of bodies, the urgent need to acquire something, anything, to prove I had been there. It’s strange to think about it now, in the stillness of my own home. We all flew thousands of miles to stand in the same designated spots, to angle our cameras for the identical shot that already exists a million times over online. We followed a brightly colored umbrella through streets we’ll never truly know, listening to rehearsed histories while searching for a feeling of authenticity that the very act of searching for it seemed to vaporize. It felt less like living and more like a frantic rehearsal for a memory we were supposed to have later. What was the point of collecting the proof if the experience itself felt so hollow?
