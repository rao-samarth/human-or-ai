The rental agent had called it ‘reliable,’ a word that now echoed with a certain bitter comedy as I stood on a dusty, nameless road. The car coughed twice before leaving the lot, a mechanical premonition I’d foolishly ignored, and now its engine released a final, pathetic hiss of steam. My phone had died, of course, its screen a blank, unhelpful mirror. The only map was a flimsy paper thing I'd grabbed as an afterthought, and the wind seemed intent on claiming it as its prize. I leaned against the warm hood, watching the sky bleed into shades of orange and purple. It was almost beautiful, this grand, indifferent sunset. A perfect backdrop for a quiet story about a person slowly realizing they might be dinner for whatever lived in the hills. At least the car would be useful for something then, perhaps as a very large, very inconvenient salt lick.
