I admit it, I am not a 'water sommelier'. I don’t know why I said it at that party three years ago; the words just sort of fell out of my mouth. Since then, I’ve been swirling tap water in wine glasses, sniffing it with a serious expression, and declaring it has 'notes of granite with an aggressive, municipal finish'. You all believed it. You even threw me that 'Hydration Celebration' for my last birthday. But things have now officially escalated. The local news wants to interview me about the town's reservoir project, and an artisanal water company from Norway just shipped a crate of their 'Viking Tears' spring water to the house, asking for an official endorsement. They included a tiny velvet hammer to 'gently crack the glacial ice seal'. I’m standing here in my kitchen at two in the morning, holding a ridiculous little hammer, because my lie has become far too hydrated.
