David's email was a masterpiece of corporate ambiguity, and everyone on the floor was panicking. They saw the phrase “sunsetting our current approach” and immediately started updating their résumés. But they missed the obvious signs, the little breadcrumbs he left for anyone actually paying attention. Why use the word “sunsetting” and not “terminating”? Because something new rises after the sun sets. The attachment wasn't named 'Final_Report'; it was 'Q3_Forward_Plan_v0.2'. This isn’t an ending, it’s an early draft of the next stage. He cc’d HR but not the department head—a classic maneuver to handle personnel reassignments quietly before the official announcement. It’s not a layoff, it's a restructuring. They think it's an execution; I see the preparation for a surgical extraction. They can scramble for the lifeboats if they want. I’m already walking toward the new ship.
