The house was so still, holding its breath in the dark. He used to say my quiet was a sign of disapproval, a weapon I wielded in our arguments. I believed him for so long. It was easier than admitting the silence was just me, retreating into the only space he hadn't yet claimed. He had a way of twisting my own thoughts back at me, presenting them as polished, unrecognizable stones I was meant to admire. He’d frame his critiques as concern, his jealousy as a measure of his affection. And I, so desperate for that affection, learned to see myself through his carefully constructed lens. Now, alone in the quiet he once condemned, I can almost hear the sound of my own thinking, faint and unfamiliar, like a language I've forgotten how to speak. The love I thought was a shelter feels more like a cage he carefully built, bar by shimmering bar, using my own hopes as the material.
