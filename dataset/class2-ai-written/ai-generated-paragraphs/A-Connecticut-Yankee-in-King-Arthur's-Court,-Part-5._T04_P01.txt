My phone’s navigation system, a supposed pinnacle of satellite engineering, had officially given up. It kept insisting the legendary goat cheese maker was located somewhere inside a seventeenth-century stone wall. I stood in the tiny piazza, spinning in a slow circle of digital despair, much to the amusement of a woman shelling beans on her doorstep. She watched my technological meltdown for a moment before gesturing me over with a flick of her head. I pointed at my screen, trying to mime "lost" and "cheese." She just chuckled, pulled out a surprisingly modern smartphone, and tapped the screen. But instead of a map, she showed me a picture she had taken of a bright yellow scarf tied to a drainpipe. She then pointed down a cobblestone alley so narrow it looked like a crack in the world. Apparently, the town's centuries-old scarf-based directional system was still far superior to my global positioning.
