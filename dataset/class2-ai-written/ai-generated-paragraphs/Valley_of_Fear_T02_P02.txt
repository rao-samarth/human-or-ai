The bus rattled through the valley, and with every kilometer, the quiet grew heavier. My fellow passengers seemed to hold a collective breath, their gazes fixed on their own hands or the passing fields, but never on each other. There was a practiced stillness to them, a carefulness that spoke of unspoken rules I could only guess at. I saw a man with a fresh, pale scar bisecting his eyebrow quickly turn his face to the window when he caught my glance. But then, as we rounded a bend, two small children in a dusty yard sent a kite soaring into the wind, a thing cobbled together from newspaper and brilliant blue plastic. Their laughter, sharp and pure, pierced the humming silence inside the bus. For just a moment, a few heads turned, and I saw the tension in their shoulders ease, a flicker of something unburdened in their eyes before they looked away again.
