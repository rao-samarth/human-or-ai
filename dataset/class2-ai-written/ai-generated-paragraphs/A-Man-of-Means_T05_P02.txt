“You have no idea what it’s like,” she hissed, her voice a low tremor that barely cut through the clinking of champagne flutes in the next room. Her brother just smirked, swirling the amber liquid in his own glass. “No idea? I was there, remember? I saw you have a complete meltdown because the shaman’s yurt didn’t have the correct southern exposure. The absolute *trauma* of it all.” He let out a short, bitter laugh. She flinched, her carefully constructed composure cracking. “That’s not what it was about and you know it. It was about authenticity! It was about energetic alignment! You wouldn't understand; you just buy your enlightenment from a catalog, ticking boxes for ‘inner peace’ and ‘mindfulness’ like you're ordering a new set of golf clubs.” He leaned in closer, the smirk gone. “And you don’t? My golf clubs at least help my handicap. What has your fifty-thousand-dollar weekend of chanting and sweating in a designer tent actually fixed for you?”
