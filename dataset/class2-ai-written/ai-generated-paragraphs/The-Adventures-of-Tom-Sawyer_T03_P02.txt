The first argument I made to myself was that nobody saw. In a city of millions, with the afternoon rush pushing past and the incessant blare of horns filling the air, my small action was a whisper in a hurricane. It was so easy. A brief hesitation, a quick glance around at the blur of indifferent faces, and it was done. I told myself it was survival, that the world had dealt me a bad hand and this was just a way to even the score, a small correction. That justification felt so solid in the moment, a heavy and satisfying weight. But it’s a weight that never leaves. It sits in my gut now, a cold little stone, and the louder part of my mind keeps trying to build a case around it, presenting evidence and precedents. The quieter part, however, offers no defense. It just sits there, knowing the truth.
