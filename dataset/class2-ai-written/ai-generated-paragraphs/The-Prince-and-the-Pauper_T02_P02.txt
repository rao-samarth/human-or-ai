No, you’re still thinking of it as two separate problems to be solved. They aren't. It’s a single system with two outputs, and one fundamentally requires the other. This isn't a ladder that some people simply fail to climb; it’s a scale, perfectly balanced. For one side to be elevated so impossibly high, the other must be crushed down with an equal and opposite force. We see a penthouse with a city view and a basement apartment with a spreading water stain, and we treat them as unrelated circumstances. But they exist on the same electrical grid, powered by the same currents. The immense surplus that insulates one life from any meaningful consequence is drawn directly from the profound deficit that defines the other. It isn’t an accident of fortune. It's mechanics.
