You have to understand, this was never about leaving you, not really. It was about the suffocating safety of it all. I knew what Tuesday would feel like before Monday was even over. Every morning was a copy of the last, a perfect, sterile print, and I felt myself fading inside the frame. I needed a moment of pure static, a single, terrifying second where the map disappeared and I didn't know which way was north. It wasn’t a desire for chaos, but a desperate need for a question without a clear answer. I just wanted to stand at a crossroads I didn’t recognize and feel the simple, frightening thrill of choosing a direction for the very first time.
