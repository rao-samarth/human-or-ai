The house is quiet now, the city asleep beyond the window. It’s easy to mistake one form of rule for another, as they both wear the same face of authority. But the distinction is fundamental, and it rests on the ruler’s relationship with the law. A just sovereign understands that their power is granted by the very framework they are sworn to protect; they are the first subject of the state, not its owner. Their authority is a heavy responsibility, a custodial duty for something that will outlast them. A despot, however, sees the state as a mere extension of their own will. The law becomes a tool for them, flexible and arbitrary, used to enforce their whims rather than to provide stable ground for everyone. Ultimately, one leader is bound by the same principles as the lowest citizen, while the other believes they are the principle itself.
