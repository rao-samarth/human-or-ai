I know what you’re all thinking, sitting there with your forks halfway to your mouths. You think I didn't consider it, but that’s not true. I considered it for about five minutes, which at the time felt like an eternity of pure, uncut certainty. It seemed so simple then, a single signature to solve a problem I mistakenly thought was only mine. I never imagined the ripple effect, the way it would echo through all of you. I didn't picture your faces, or the quiet, unanswered phone calls. I just saw an open door and ran straight through it without once looking back. But you can't outrun the silence in a room like this, can you? That one single, brilliant moment of freedom has now become this permanent, heavy thing that sits between us all, and I have to live with the fact that I'm the one who put it there.
