“You’re making a mistake,” she said, her voice softer now, a weapon she had honed over two decades of carefully managed concern. “I just want what’s best for you.” My hand tightened around the car keys in my pocket until the metal bit into my palm. Was she right? Every instinct, conditioned by years of her guidance, screamed at me to sit back down, to apologize, to unpack the single suitcase waiting by the door. But a newer, quieter voice whispered back, asking what "best" truly meant. Did it mean this suffocating safety, this life planned out on a flowchart where every decision was pre-approved? Looking at her, I saw the genuine fear in her eyes, and a wave of guilt crashed over me. It would be so easy to give in, to be the good child again for just a little longer. It would also mean I might never find out who I was without her telling me first. The keys suddenly felt impossibly heavy.
