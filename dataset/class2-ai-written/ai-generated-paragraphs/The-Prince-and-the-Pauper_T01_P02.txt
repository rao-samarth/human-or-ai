I watch the scarecrow from the porch, slumped over its post in the fading light. It’s dressed in my father’s old work shirt, the one with the frayed collar, and a hat that’s seen better days. That's its entire biography, right there for the crows and anyone else to see. A shape in a field, a collection of cast-off things meant to look like a man. No one asks what it thinks about when the wind rattles its straw insides or if it gets lonely under the vast, empty sky. Its purpose is its appearance. We see the tattered clothes, the static posture, and we know everything we need to know. I wonder if we aren't all just scarecrows of a kind, dressed in the parts we've been given, hoping the world reads the story we're trying to tell.
