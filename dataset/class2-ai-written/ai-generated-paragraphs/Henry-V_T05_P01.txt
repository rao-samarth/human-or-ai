He didn't call it a failure. He called it a "misalignment of strategic assets." He leaned forward, steepling his fingers, and the entire room went quiet. He wasn't talking about the missed deadlines or the client who walked; he was spinning a tale of "sub-optimal process integration." My objections felt clumsy, too real. I’d say, "The server crashed for three days," and he would smoothly reframe it as a "temporary infrastructure deficit," a challenge my team should have "proactively managed." His words were smooth, polished stones, while mine were jagged rocks. He built a fortress of jargon around the disaster, and suddenly, I wasn't the one reporting a crisis. I was the one who failed to "leverage the opportunity for systemic recalibration." He didn't raise his voice once. He just calmly, precisely, talked me into a corner until the facts didn't matter anymore, only his narrative did.
