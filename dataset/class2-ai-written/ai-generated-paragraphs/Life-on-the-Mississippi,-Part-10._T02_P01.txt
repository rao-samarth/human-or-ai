You should have seen the surgeon explain it to us yesterday in the pre-op. He wasn’t trying to be comforting, not really, but his sheer competence was more reassuring than any platitude could ever be. He stood there, hands clasped, and described the entire procedure with a calm, detached precision that left no room for doubt. Every question we had, he answered not with a guess, but with a fact, a statistic, a simple and irrefutable piece of mechanics about the human body. It wasn't a conversation between equals; it was a transmission of knowledge from someone who simply *knows*. In that room, his word wasn’t just an opinion, it was the operating principle of reality for the next several hours. We all just nodded along, because what else can you do when you’re in the presence of that kind of authority? You just have to trust it completely.
