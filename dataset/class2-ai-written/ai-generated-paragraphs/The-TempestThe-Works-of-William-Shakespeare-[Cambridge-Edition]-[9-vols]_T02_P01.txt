The house makes its usual symphony of nonsense after midnight. A pipe groans in the wall, and my brilliant brain immediately concludes it’s a phantom weeping over its unfinished business. Right. The refrigerator hums a little too loud, and suddenly it’s a portal to another dimension, probably one with better snacks. Every flicker of a streetlight through the blinds becomes a coded message from the great beyond. It's a fantastic performance, really. You spend all day dealing with painfully concrete things like bills and deadlines, only to have your own mind betray you with a B-movie horror plot the second the lights are out. You’re supposed to question your sanity, to wonder what’s truly there. But honestly, the only thing I'm questioning is whether that groaning pipe is going to cost me a fortune to fix.
