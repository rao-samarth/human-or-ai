People think this city is just noise and random motion, but they aren't paying attention. There’s an unofficial balance sheet, and I’ve seen the entries. Take the man in the perfect grey suit, the one who walks down the pavement like he’s personally laid every stone and expects you to step aside. Papers and contracts can’t touch a man like that; he’s insulated from consequences by layers of money and lawyers. But the city has other methods. This morning, a bus hit a deep, greasy puddle at the exact moment he was striding past. The timing was almost surgical. A wave of brown water arced through the air and drenched him, ruining the coat, the shoes, everything. He just stood there, sputtering, as the rest of us flowed around him. There's no judge for that, no appeal. Just a debt quietly being settled on a Tuesday morning.
