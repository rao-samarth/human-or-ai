The first drip was easy enough to ignore. Brenda was halfway through explaining the new zoning ordinance—something about tool sheds, I think—when the second and third drips followed. I just smiled and refilled her iced tea, pretending it was the house settling. But then the ceiling developed a sort of pregnant bulge, right over the good rug, and the sound became less of a drip and more of a quiet, insistent gurgle. Honestly, the worst part wasn’t the water, which I’m told is quite extensive now. It was the way everyone stopped talking. They just stared up, mouths slightly open, holding their little plates of cucumber sandwiches. It’s not my fault the raccoon had a vendetta against our copper piping, but you’d think I’d planned the whole deluge just to disrupt the conversation.
