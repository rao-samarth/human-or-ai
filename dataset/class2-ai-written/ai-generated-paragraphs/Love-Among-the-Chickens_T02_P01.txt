It’s like my brain has this pre-programmed escape hatch for any sign of genuine interest, a self-defense mechanism that’s long past its expiration date. Years of things not working out have made me an expert at building walls, brick by tedious brick. But this time, sitting here in this coffee shop watching the rain streak the windows, I thought about how he waited for me to finish my story the other day, how he didn't flinch or try to fill the silence when I got quiet. He just waited. It’s not about him needing to break down my walls; that’s my job. It’s about him making me feel like it’s finally safe to open the door, even just a crack. I just texted him back 'yes'. The woman at the next table glanced over, probably because I’m smiling at my phone like a complete idiot. Maybe that's a good first step.
