You see them everywhere, at the next table or in a queue, so certain in their pronouncements. It’s a strange ritual, this public condemnation of strangers for minor infractions, a performance designed to signal their own unimpeachable character. We construct these elaborate scaffoldings of personal ethics, not to guide our own private actions, but to have something solid to stand on while we judge the world below. It’s a competition of perceived goodness, where the prize is simply the momentary satisfaction of feeling superior. I often wonder what happens when these people are alone, when there’s no audience to applaud their carefully curated virtue. Does the scaffolding collapse? Is the frantic, messy business of being human just as present in them as in those they so easily dismiss, hidden just behind the curtain of their self-righteousness? It all seems so exhausting, this desperate need to be seen as correct rather than to simply be good.
