The house settled around me, its old bones creaking in the silence. It knew. Every choice I ever made, every turn taken or ignored, had conspired to bring me to this specific chair, in this specific hour, while the world slept.

There was no argument left to make, no desperate plea to offer. All the frantic energy of denial had long since burned away, leaving only this still, calm certainty. It wasn't a surrender, but a simple recognition of a fundamental equation, a conclusion that was written into the very beginning of the problem. This was simply the moment the ink finally dried.
