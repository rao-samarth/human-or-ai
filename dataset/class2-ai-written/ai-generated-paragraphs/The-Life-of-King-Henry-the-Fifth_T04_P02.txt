Look, I know what you’re thinking. You're seeing the scuffs and the cracks, the whole messy history written on the surface, and you’re making a judgment. It’s easy to do. But that’s just the armor we build, isn’t it? It’s the clumsy fortification we put up to face the world, and it rarely shows the person living inside. Behind all that, there's always something else, something better that's still trying to grow. I have to believe that. I have to believe people are more than the sum of their scars or their worst decisions. There’s a quiet goodness in almost everyone, a small, stubborn light that hasn’t gone out, and maybe all it needs is for someone to trust it’s there, to give it a chance to finally push through.
