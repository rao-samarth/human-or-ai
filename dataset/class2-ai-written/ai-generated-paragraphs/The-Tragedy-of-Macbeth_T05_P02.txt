I was thinking about Mr. Henderson, our old mayor, the other day. He knew the name of every dog on my street. When he'd push for a new town ordinance, it was because he’d spent weeks talking to people, actually listening to what they needed, making sure the town thrived for everyone. His authority felt like a heavy coat he wore for our benefit. Now, we've got this new guy on the council, the one with the out-of-state license plates. He just issues mandates. He doesn't seem to care what anyone thinks; he just wants compliance so his projects get finished. It’s strange how two people can hold power so differently. One builds a community up from the inside, earning respect brick by brick. The other just sees the town as a map, moving pieces around for his own game.
