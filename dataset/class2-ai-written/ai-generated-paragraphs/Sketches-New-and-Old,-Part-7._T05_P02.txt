From my perch on the wooden stile, I watched them mending the old dry-stone wall. A couple of them, young and earnest, were slathering bright grey mortar between the ancient, lichen-covered stones. They worked with a confident efficiency, certain their modern fix was superior to the old ways of just fitting and balancing. They couldn't see, or chose to ignore, the crumbling sections just a few yards away where their grandfathers had likely tried the same trick. That old, brittle mortar was the very reason the wall had given way in the first place, its rigidity cracking the venerable stones it was meant to save. They were patching the symptom with the cause, whistling as they worked, sealing in the certainty of the wall's next eventual failure.
