The old ministry building looms over the market square, a relic of white stone and impossibly high columns. Throngs of people surge around its base, a river of modern life, their chatter lost in the city's hum. But sometimes I stop and just look at it, and the noise fades. I imagine the edicts that came from behind its grand doors, decisions made in a foreign tongue that carved up families and futures, scattering them like dust. I see the ghosts of those decisions in the faces of the street vendors, in the lines etched around the eyes of the old men playing chess, in the very way people carry themselves with a resilience forged in fire. This city pulses with a vibrant, defiant energy, yet the shadow of that building stretches long, a silent reminder of a wound that never truly closed.
