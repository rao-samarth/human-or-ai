Okay, so the alarms. I know. But you have to understand the logic, however flawed it seems right now. I just wanted to play *the song*—our song—at the perfect moment. A little surprise. So I found a way into his smart home system, which wasn't even hard, because of course the password was his dog’s name. Then I saw the controls for the lights, the thermostat, everything, and I thought I could build a whole atmosphere, a symphony of affection. But I must have tripped some obscure security protocol. One minute it was supposed to be a gentle digital sunrise, and the next, every bulb in the house was strobing red and a mechanical voice was announcing a system-wide breach. All I wanted was to manufacture one perfect, cinematic moment. That's the only charge you can pin on me.
