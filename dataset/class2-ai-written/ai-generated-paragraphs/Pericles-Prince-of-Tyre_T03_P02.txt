Oh, spare me the lecture on integrity. It’s a lovely little story you tell yourself, isn't it? A bedtime tale for adults who are afraid of the dark. You stand there, polished and proud, acting as if your refusal to get your hands dirty makes you better than the rest of us. But what does it actually accomplish? Nothing. The gears keep turning, the machine keeps grinding, and your noble sacrifice means less than zero. It’s just a private, self-congratulatory performance. You think you’re a holdout, a final bastion of what’s right? You’re not a beacon; you’re a speed bump, and the world is going to roll right over you without even noticing. Enjoy the view from your high horse while it lasts.
