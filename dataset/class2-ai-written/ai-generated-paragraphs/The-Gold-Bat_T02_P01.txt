I wish you’d been here, if only to see the way everyone sized up Maria’s new partner when he first arrived. He was so quiet, just standing by the window with his hands in his pockets, and I could see them all writing their own stories. Too shy. Not a good fit for our loud family. Aunt Carol had him pegged as dreadfully dull within five minutes. But I caught him alone for a moment by the bookshelf, and we started talking. It turns out he spends his weekends restoring old, discarded photographs he finds at flea markets. He spoke about giving faces back to forgotten people, and his whole demeanor changed. His eyes, which had seemed so guarded, were suddenly full of a quiet passion. They all missed it, of course. They were too busy talking over each other to actually listen. It’s funny how we decide who a person is before they’ve even had a chance to speak.
