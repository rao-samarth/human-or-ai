The fluorescent lights hummed, a monotonous soundtrack for the slow grind of another Tuesday afternoon. My cursor blinked, a lonely, rhythmic pulse on a sea of spreadsheets filled with data that meant nothing. Another email notification popped up, its subject line screaming URGENT in all caps. It was about synergy. Or deliverables. Or some other hollow word invented to fill the void where meaning was supposed to be. I stared at the blinking line, then at the gray fabric of my cubicle wall, a cage I had willingly entered every day for six years. Enough. I didn't slam the laptop shut. I simply closed it, the click barely audible over the office drone. I stood, grabbed my jacket, and walked past the glass-walled conference room where projections were being analyzed. No one noticed. The automatic doors slid open, bathing me in real, messy sunlight, and I just kept walking, leaving the ghost of my career blinking on an unattended screen.
