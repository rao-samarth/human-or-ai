Look, I know what the posters say, all glory and honor, and I won't lie to you; it's nothing like that. It’s mud and waiting, and a kind of noise that gets inside your bones and never really leaves. You see things you can't unsee, and you lose people you thought you'd have forever. But that’s not the whole story, is it? There’s a moment, after the chaos, when you share the last of your water with someone who was a stranger yesterday. Or you see the sun rise over a wrecked field and you don't just see the destruction; you see the space where something new has to grow. That’s what we’re fighting for. Not the parades, not the medals. We're enduring all of this so that one day, kids can just worry about scraped knees and not sirens. It's about the quiet morning that comes after.
