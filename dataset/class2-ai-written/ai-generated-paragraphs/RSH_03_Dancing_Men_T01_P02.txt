The hiss of the milk steamer was a decent enough white noise, almost letting me focus. But then a woman at the next table let out this sharp, sudden laugh—not a giggle, but a real bark of a thing. And just like that, I wasn't here anymore. My coffee went cold on the table because I was suddenly back on that cracked leather sofa, the one with the spring that always poked you in the back. He had that same laugh. He’d throw his head back, and for a second you’d believe that nothing bad could ever happen again. It was a sound that promised permanence. I blinked, and the woman was just a stranger stirring her latte, completely unaware she’d just summoned a ghost to sit at my table. It’s strange how you can move cities and change everything, but a random sound can still find you, a little reminder of all the rooms you’ve left behind.
