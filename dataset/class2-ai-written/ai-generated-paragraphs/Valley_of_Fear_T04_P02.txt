I’m writing this on a train somewhere between cities, watching the landscape flatten into an endless grey. It’s funny, out here you have so much time to think. I keep turning over what happened last month, that final outcome we were all waiting for. There was such a clean, sharp sense of rightness when the news came through, like a snapped bone finally being set. We all said it was what he deserved, that the scales were finally balanced. But sitting here, I can’t shake the memory of the look on his face. And I have to wonder, when does setting things right become just another way of breaking something yourself? I keep replaying my own feeling of satisfaction, and it doesn't feel as clean as I thought it would. It feels hot.
