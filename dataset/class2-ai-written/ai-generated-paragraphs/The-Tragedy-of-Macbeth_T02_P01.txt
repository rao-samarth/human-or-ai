The train rocked hypnotically, blurring the distant farms into a single, sorrowful green. I keep returning to that one moment, turning it over like a smooth, dark stone in my pocket. I know I made the choice. My hands packed the bag, my voice spoke the words, my feet walked out the door. It was all me. And yet, tracing the path backward, I see a thousand tiny currents pushing me toward that single, inevitable shoreline: a delayed flight months earlier, a forgotten umbrella, a chance meeting that felt like anything but chance. Each event, so small at the time, now seems like a carefully placed signpost. Was it ever truly a decision, or was it just me finally arriving at the place my own history had been sending me all along? The steel wheels scream on the track, and I don't know if it's the sound of escape or of a cage being dragged to its destination.
