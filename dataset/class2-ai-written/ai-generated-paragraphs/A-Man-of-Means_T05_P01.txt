“You simply don’t understand the vision, Marcus.” He slid a can of beans into place on the shelf, the metallic click a final, punctuating sound in the argument she was determined to have. “Marble,” he said, not turning around. “You want to pave the town square with Italian marble.” Eleanor sighed, a theatrical display of patience. “The Carrara would elevate the entire atmosphere. Think of the tourism potential! My wellness consultant says the current cobblestones are terribly bad for one’s posture, not to mention what they do to a decent driving loafer.” Marcus finally faced her, his face a mixture of exhaustion and disbelief. “My grandfather laid those stones, Eleanor. He laid them with half the men from this town after the fire in '48. They're not for your posture; they're our foundation.” She waved a dismissive hand, the diamonds on her wrist catching the dull fluorescent light. “Foundations can be rebuilt, darling. Preferably by someone with better taste.”
