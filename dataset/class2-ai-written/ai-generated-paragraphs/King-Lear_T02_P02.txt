The sound of my uncle’s laughter booms from the kitchen, and my cousin is passionately explaining the benefits of her new hybrid SUV. Everyone here seems so anchored, so certain of the ground beneath their feet. I just nod along, remembering the months when the floor fell out from under my own world, when the frantic noise of everyday life was replaced by a different kind of static. Back then, concerns about promotions and property lines dissolved into the singular, terrifying task of holding myself together. It was a hell I wouldn't wish on anyone, yet coming back from it has left me with a strange secret. I can see the scaffolding they all take for granted, and I know how easily it can all come apart. There's a quiet, unnerving peace in that knowledge.
