The way he always parks the car to give her the widest possible space to open her door, even if it means a longer walk for him. The way she comes out with a cup of tea for the mail carrier on cold mornings. Last week, I saw him spend ten minutes coaxing a scared cat from under their car. They aren't loud gestures, just tiny, consistent acts of quiet consideration. Maybe they aren't standoffish at all; maybe they're just a bit shy, speaking a language of kindness that you can only understand when you slow down enough to actually see it.”
