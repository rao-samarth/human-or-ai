They told me this valley was steeped in ancient lore, a place where the old world still breathed. Every crooked oak and moss-covered stone supposedly has a name and a tragic backstory involving a heartbroken nymph or a vengeful god. The locals point to that peculiar ring of hills and whisper about a sleeping giant, his stony knuckles breaking the earth. It’s all terribly romantic. From my porch, however, the giant’s knuckles look suspiciously like a series of rather uninspired glacial deposits. The 'whispering woods' are mostly just creaking in a way that suggests a good strong wind would solve their mystical problems permanently. The real enchantment around here isn't in the fog-shrouded mornings, but in the rare, miraculous moment the Wi-Fi connection holds for more than five consecutive minutes. That’s a legend I could actually get behind.
