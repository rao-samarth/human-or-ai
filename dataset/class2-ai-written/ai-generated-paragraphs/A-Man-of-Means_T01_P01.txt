Watching the countryside blur from the train window, it strikes me how strange the architecture of an unbound life can become. We chase this idea of ultimate freedom, the ability to go anywhere and do anything, yet once attained at a certain scale, that liberty begins to calcify. Spontaneity is replaced by logistics. A simple desire for a local meal becomes a security assessment and a reservation vetted by an assistant a month in advance. The world, once a place to be explored, turns into a portfolio of assets to be managed: the villa in Tuscany, the apartment in Tokyo, the chalet that sits empty ten months of the year. Each possession, meant to be a key opening a new door to experience, instead becomes another lock on the gate. You build a fortress of comfort and convenience to protect yourself from the world, only to find you have successfully locked yourself inside, peering out and wondering what the weather is really like.
