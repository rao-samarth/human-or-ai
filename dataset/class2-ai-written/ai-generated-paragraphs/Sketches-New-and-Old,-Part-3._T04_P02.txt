I know what he said, I was in the same room. But are we really going to just do it? Hand over the keys to the whole operation because he has an impressive degree and a firm handshake? The man spent a week here, David. A week. He looked at spreadsheets, ran his models, and came back with a plan that treats our entire engineering division like a line item to be optimized away. You keep saying he’s the expert, the best in the business, but he never even left the third floor. He didn't speak to a single person whose job he's recommending we eliminate. We’re supposed to trust his objective analysis over what we’ve built for fifteen years? It feels less like a strategy and more like a complete abdication of our own judgment, and I can’t shake this awful feeling that we're about to walk off a cliff because the man with the expensive map told us it was a shortcut.
