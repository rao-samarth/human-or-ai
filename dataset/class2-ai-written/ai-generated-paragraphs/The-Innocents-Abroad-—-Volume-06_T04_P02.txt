I was just telling Sarah, you look at this ritual basin, and the little plaque drones on about purification rites and appeasing the river spirits. Fine. But all I can see is a spectacular waste of perfectly good engineering. They spent generations carving this from a single block of stone, hauling it for miles, all for what? To splash some water around? Imagine if they’d applied that same manpower and dedication to building a proper aqueduct or an irrigation system. They could have doubled their crop yields, supported a larger population, built a real city instead of a collection of huts around a fancy birdbath. It’s beautiful, I guess, if you’re into that sort of thing, but it’s fundamentally inefficient. You don’t build a future on myths; you build it on infrastructure. People forget that.
