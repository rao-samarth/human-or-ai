The late afternoon sun warmed the ancient stones of the church wall where the vicar stood, his hands clasped behind his back. "It’s just a bell, Thomas," the councillor said, her tone meticulously reasonable as she gestured towards the stone tower. "A simple, audible way to announce the new flood warnings. It's for everyone's safety." Thomas watched a cloud drift across the sky before answering. "It is the voice of this parish, Helen. It calls the faithful to prayer, it mourns our dead, and it celebrates our unions before God. It isn't a town crier for bureaucratic notices." She sighed, a small puff of impatience. "And the council is responsible for the safety of everyone in this parish, believer or not. That responsibility has to supersede tradition." He finally turned to face her, his expression unyielding. "You’re asking to turn something sacred into a mere utility. There is a line between what belongs to God and what belongs to the public good, and you are trying to cross it." The councillor simply adjusted her jacket. "That line is getting finer every year."
