I'm on a train somewhere between Florence and Rome, watching the hills blur into a single green smear. You'd love it here. Something happened at the station, though, and I can't shake it. A man dropped his wallet getting on the train ahead of me. I saw it plain as day, lying on the platform as the doors hissed shut. And I just… watched it. For a split second, I swear, a part of me considered it. The train was already pulling away, so no one would have known. One voice in my head, the practical one, was calling me a fool for leaving it there. But another, quieter part of me just felt this profound sense of relief that the decision was made for me. It was simply gone. Still, the image of it sitting there on the grey stone is stuck behind my eyes. I keep replaying it, wondering if that relief was the right thing to feel, or just cowardice in disguise.
