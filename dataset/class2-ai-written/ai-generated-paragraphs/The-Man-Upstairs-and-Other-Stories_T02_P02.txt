I’m writing this on a train somewhere between two cities whose names I can’t pronounce, watching the fields blur into a smear of green and yellow. You know that feeling I was trying to escape? It packed itself in my bag and came right along with me. Every so often I see something that feels perfect—a collapsing stone wall, a lone bird on a wire—and by the time I grab my notebook, the moment is gone and the desire to capture it feels hollow, almost foolish. The grand vision I had for this journey has shrunk to the size of a blank page in yet another cafe. There's this humming anxiety, a constant pressure to make something worthwhile out of all this newness, but mostly I just feel the immense distance between the thing I want to create and the thing I am actually capable of. It’s a quiet and profoundly lonely kind of failure.
