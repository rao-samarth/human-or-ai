The problem isn’t the specific words you chose, but the unspoken belief that they could ever perfectly convey the thought behind them. We operate on this flawed premise that language is a clear vessel, that I can simply pour my meaning into it and you can drink it down, unchanged. But it’s not like that. Your words are filtered through my entire existence—my fears, my past, my private definition of every term you use. What you intended as a simple statement arrives as something else entirely, something warped by the journey. We are two separate consciousnesses, shouting at each other across an impassable void, mistaking the echoes we hear for the other’s true voice. And so we end up here, arguing not with each other, but with the distorted phantoms we’ve each created in our own minds.
