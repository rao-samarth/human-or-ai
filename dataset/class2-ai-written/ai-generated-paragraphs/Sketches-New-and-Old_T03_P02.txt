Uncle Barry, his face turning a concerning shade of magenta, was locked in a heated one-sided argument with the small grey cylinder on the counter. "Play 'Happy Birthday' for Jean," he enunciated, as if speaking to a tourist with a poor grasp of the language. The cylinder blinked its little blue light thoughtfully before blasting a Swedish death metal track at a volume that rattled the fine china. His son, Kevin, dove for his phone, frantically navigating menus and muttering about firmware updates and network interference. Aunt Carol, meanwhile, watched the spectacle over her slice of cake. "You know," she offered gently, "we could just... sing it?" The suggestion hung in the air, a radical, almost unthinkable concept. Kevin didn't even look up from his screen, and Barry, now trying to reason with the device in a fake Scottish accent, seemed not to hear her at all. The music cut out, replaced by a soothing voice detailing the history of industrial farming.
