You keep saying it’s a good thing, all this space, but you haven't been here long enough to feel the silence press in on you after the sun goes down. It's not peaceful; it's empty. Out here, there's no background noise to drown out the little whispers in your own head, the ones that get louder and stranger with each passing week. You think the distance between houses means privacy? It means no one can hear you. It means no one is coming. People go strange when they're left alone for too long with nothing but the wind and their own thoughts for company. They start to forget the rules, or maybe they just decide the rules don't apply anymore when there’s nobody around to enforce them. It’s a different kind of wild out here, and it has nothing to do with the animals.
