It’s three in the morning and the only sound is the low hum of the refrigerator. I remember when I started all this, I had a very clear picture of the person I wanted to be; there were lines I swore I'd never cross. But it’s funny how those lines get smudged when you’re climbing. Each little compromise felt so logical at the time, just a tiny adjustment to keep moving forward, to get that slight edge over someone else. A fib to a colleague, a promise I conveniently forgot to an old friend—I told myself it was all for the bigger picture. Now I’m here, in this big, quiet house, and I’m not even sure I recognize the person staring back from the dark reflection in the window. I got what I wanted, I suppose. I just can't remember who I had to become to get it.
