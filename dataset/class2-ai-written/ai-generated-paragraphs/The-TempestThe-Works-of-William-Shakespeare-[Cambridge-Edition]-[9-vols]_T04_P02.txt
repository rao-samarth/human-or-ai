The sirens hit us first, a sudden shriek that made everyone flinch and pull over. We were just another car, shoved to the side of the road by the sheer force of the sound. Motorcycles carved a path through the gridlock, their riders gesturing with sharp, impatient movements that were less requests than commands. Then came the procession: a sleek, black arrow of identical sedans with windows so dark they drank the afternoon light. You couldn't see who was inside, only the effect they had on the world. They didn’t slow for intersections or acknowledge the sea of frozen onlookers. A fruit vendor's cart toppled, spilling oranges across the asphalt. No one stopped. The motorcade simply consumed the street, a momentary king demanding absolute obedience from the pavement itself, and then vanished, leaving only a trail of exhaust and a ringing silence where the city used to be.
