He used to sit on his porch steps, nursing a single beer until the sun went down. We’d talk about nothing important, which of course was everything. Then the money arrived. The first change was the fence, a tall iron thing that seemed to appear overnight. Then the old house came down, and a new one went up, all sharp angles and dark glass where the clapboard had been. He doesn't sit outside anymore. Sometimes you see his expensive car sliding silently out of the automatic gate, but he never waves. I’m not sure he even looks. It’s strange to mourn someone you still see every other day.
