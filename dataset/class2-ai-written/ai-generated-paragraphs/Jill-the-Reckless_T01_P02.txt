In our weekly strategy sessions, the real currency isn't innovative ideas but carefully curated anecdotes. It's less about the pitch and more about the prelude. Someone will casually mention a weekend sailing off a private coast or a chance encounter with a well-known family, and you can feel the room recalibrate. The actual business proposals that follow are almost secondary, judged not on their own merit but by the perceived status of their presenter. A brilliant suggestion from a junior associate might be met with polite nods, while a mediocre thought from someone with the right surname is treated as a revelation. The air is thick with unspoken assessments, a constant, quiet calculation of school ties, vacation destinations, and last names. It’s a performance where the script is your resume and the costume is your watch.
