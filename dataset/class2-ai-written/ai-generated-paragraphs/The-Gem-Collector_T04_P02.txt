You want to know why. Honestly, I’m not sure I have a good answer, not one that would make sense to you. When you can have anything you point at, you stop wanting to point, and the days just sort of smear into each other like cheap watercolor. I moved here for the quiet, but the quiet started ringing in my ears after a while. That car, the engine… it was the only sound that cut through the stillness. It became this stupid little game, seeing how fast I could take the corners on Miller Road at 3 a.m., seeing if I could time the yellows perfectly. For just a few seconds on an empty street, everything felt sharp and real, not muted and gray. I guess I just forgot other people live in the real world, too.
