In the transient light of a station café, I listened to a man describe a storm he’d supposedly sailed through. He didn't just speak of large waves; he gave them character, naming the one that broke the mast and describing the particular green of the water just before it hit. His hands remained perfectly still on his cup, a small detail of calm that somehow sold the chaos of his narrative. It’s a curious skill, building a fiction not on grand, sweeping claims but on a foundation of tiny, unverifiable specifics. The precise number of gulls that followed his sinking vessel. The brand of cigarettes he lost to the sea. You find yourself not questioning the truth of the event, but simply admiring the architecture of its construction. The goal was never to convince, I realized, but to entertain for the price of a shared table and a moment of your time.
