The organizers, in a sincere effort to create a moment of pure, uplifting beauty, had arranged for the release of a thousand monarch butterflies into the grand ballroom. For a fleeting second, it worked; a collective gasp of wonder filled the air as the vibrant wings ascended toward the chandeliers. But wonder curdles quickly. The butterflies, disoriented and drawn to light and sweetness, descended upon the guests and the pristine banquet tables. They fluttered into wine glasses, became tangled in elaborate hairstyles, and dusted the desserts with pollen from their delicate legs. The attempt to impose a perfect, natural spectacle onto such a highly structured human affair had only introduced a fragile, unpredictable chaos. People were swatting, not smiling. The gesture, born from a desire for magic, had simply proven that even our most beautiful intentions cannot command the world to conform to our visions of order.
