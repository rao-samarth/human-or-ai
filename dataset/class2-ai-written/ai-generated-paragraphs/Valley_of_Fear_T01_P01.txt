The afternoon crowd moved like a single organism through the canyon of glass and steel, but inside that flow, every individual was a separate, sealed-off story. He used to believe a life could be renovated, that you could knock down a wall of the past and build something new in its place. But he saw now that it wasn't true. The original blueprints remained. A poor decision made a decade ago wasn't a discrete event; it was a foundational error that had dictated the angle of every wall erected since, the placement of every window. You couldn't escape it or paint over the structural flaws. You just learned to live in the crooked house you had built, navigating the slanted floors and the doors that never quite closed properly, all while the city outside hummed with the oblivious rhythm of its own forward motion.
