I stand here, swallowed by the roar of traffic and the press of a thousand shoulders, and all the old certainties feel like a cruel joke. They told us to be good, to follow the path, and that righteousness would be its own reward. But I’ve seen the kindest people I know broken by a world that doesn’t care for their quiet decency. I’ve watched calculated cruelty ascend, celebrated on glowing screens, while simple compassion is dismissed as weakness. The neat, tidy lessons of my childhood are useless noise against this cacophony of sirens and hurried footsteps. Here, in the heart of the machine, you learn the real lesson: the moral compass they hand you at the start is a cheap, spinning toy, utterly useless in the storm. The good are not always rewarded, and the wicked often thrive, and accepting that feels like a piece of your own soul breaking off and drifting away into the cold city air.
