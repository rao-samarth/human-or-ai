The house on the corner of Oak and Third began to show signs of neglect long before the for-sale sign appeared. First, it was the lawn, which grew shaggy and uneven, then the flowerbeds surrendered to weeds. People in the town noticed, of course; they always do. Whispers in the checkout line at the market spoke of shouting matches that could be heard from the sidewalk, of slammed doors and long, brittle silences that followed. The real impact, however, was seen in the children. The oldest boy, who used to be a fixture at the park's basketball court, was rarely seen, and his younger sister walked to school with a new, guarded posture. The internal fractures of their home life had finally begun to show on the outside, not as a dramatic collapse, but as a slow, steady erosion of everything that had once seemed so solid. The conflict had become a quiet poison, leaching the color from their lives and from the house itself.
