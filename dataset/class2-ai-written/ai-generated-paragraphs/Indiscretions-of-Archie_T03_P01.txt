No, listen, I'm telling you it was a travesty. A complete and utter travesty. They asked me what my greatest weakness was, and I was honest, I was vulnerable! I told them my weakness was that I sometimes care *too much* about the quality of my artisanal sandwich creations. Dead silence. Just blank stares from across the mahogany desk. I poured my soul into that answer, my very essence! And for what? To be judged by people who probably think 'gourmet' is just adding an extra pickle. I’ve rewritten my resume seventeen times. It now describes my brief stint at the frozen yogurt place as 'a leadership role in cryogenic dairy distribution.' I'm not just looking for a job, you see; I'm on a sacred quest for a living wage, and it feels like the universe is just laughing, sending me an endless stream of rejection emails that all start with 'While your passion for frozen yogurt is evident...'
