I’ve gotten so good at the nod-and-smile routine at the grocery store, chatting about the weather with the cashier and asking about her daughter’s recital. But the whole time, my phone is a dead weight in my pocket, a silent reminder of the calls I’ll have to make as soon as I’m home. The moment my front door clicks shut, it feels like I can finally exhale a breath I’ve been holding since morning. It’s a constant, low-grade hum of anxiety, this business of being two people in one body. One version of me is calm and predictable, the one everyone here knows. The other is a stranger who lives on frantic energy and secrets. My biggest fear isn’t some grand explosion; it's a simple slip of the tongue, mentioning a name or a place that has no business existing in this quiet life. The effort of keeping them separate is a constant pressure behind my eyes, an exhaustion that sleep never quite touches.
