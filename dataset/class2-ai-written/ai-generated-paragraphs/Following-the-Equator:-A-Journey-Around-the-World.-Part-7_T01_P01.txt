The clock on the mantelpiece ticked into the silence, each sound a tiny hammer against the stillness of the house. They speak of bringing light into the darkness, of lifting up the fallen. They write poems about it, sing songs in their grand halls, and congratulate themselves on their own benevolence. But what light is this? I see it only in the glint of a soldier's bayonet under the moon, or the feverish shine in the eyes of a child who has lost everything. They call our ways savage while their own courts dispense a justice that serves only their own greed. They talk of order, yet their arrival brought nothing but chaos, a carefully managed destruction they call peace. It is a strange and terrible god they serve, one that demands liberty for itself and chains for everyone else. And in the quiet of this room, with the whole city sleeping, I can hear the rustle of those chains.
