We rode up on them at the bend in the dry creek bed, a handful of dusty men gathered under the only real tree for miles. The fellow in the middle wasn't putting up a fight, just staring at the ground while they looped the rope over a thick cottonwood branch. My guide muttered something about a stolen mare, which seemed reason enough for the whole affair, I suppose. It's a long way between settlements, and a man without a horse is a man already dead out here, just on a slower schedule. They didn’t bother with a prayer. The rope looked brand new, a waste if you ask me. The horse bolted, the body snapped tight, and then there was just the slow turning and the soft creak of the branch. It held us up maybe ten minutes before we could pass. We watered our own animals a little further downstream and kept moving.
