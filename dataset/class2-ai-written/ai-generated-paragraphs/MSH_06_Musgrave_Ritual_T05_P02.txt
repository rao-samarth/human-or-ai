People mistake vengeance for a grand, destructive act, but true annihilation is quieter. It's more of a subtraction. You see, I was the architect of his entire world—not just his social standing or the career he now enjoys, but the very thoughts he believes are his own. I carefully laid the foundation of his personality, chose the colors of his ambitions, and furnished his mind with opinions and wit that made him so admired. My love was the blueprint and the labor. Now, my revenge is simply to walk away and take the plans with me. He’s left standing in a beautiful, finished structure, completely unaware that he has no idea how any of it was built. He will live out his life as a ghost in a house he can never truly own, a hollow man haunted by the sudden, inexplicable silence where his own ideas used to be.
