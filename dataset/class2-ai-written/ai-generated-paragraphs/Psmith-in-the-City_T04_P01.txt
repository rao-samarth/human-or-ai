You wouldn’t even recognize it out here. The wind across these fields doesn’t care about his important pronouncements, and the rain doesn't wait for a convenient moment to fall. I spent an hour this morning just watching crows argue on a fence post, and it felt more significant than any of the carefully curated conversations we were forced to endure over polished dining tables. Remember how he’d straighten a painting that was a millimeter askew, as if the entire world’s order depended on it? It all seems so small now, so incredibly fragile. His whole universe, built on etiquette and silverware arranged just so, feels like a dollhouse I just walked out of. Out here, the only rule is the horizon, and it’s a beautifully simple one to follow.
