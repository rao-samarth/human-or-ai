I’m sitting here watching you at the head table, all polite smiles and clinking glasses, and I can’t help but laugh to myself. Everyone sees the polished success, the person they're all here to celebrate tonight. But I just keep picturing you that one rainy Tuesday, years ago, sitting on my kitchen floor with a carton of melted ice cream, convinced everything was falling apart. We didn’t solve a single problem that night. We just sat there. And seeing you up there now, under these bright lights, I realize that's what it's all about. It was never about having the answers. It was about showing up to sit on the floor, knowing someone would be there, no matter how many formal dinners or accolades came later. Some things, thankfully, never change.
