The house is silent now, except for the hum of the refrigerator. I've gone over it a hundred times in my head, arranging the facts until they sit just right. It was a simple misunderstanding, that's all. A heated moment. Anyone would have done the same. I keep repeating that, letting the words settle in the dark corners of the living room. But the floorboards still creak where he stood, and the shadow from the coat rack looks wrong, distorted. I scrubbed the spot on the rug for an hour, but if I tilt my head, the light from the streetlamp catches it in a way that makes it seem darker than the rest of the weave. It’s nothing. Just a shadow, a memory playing tricks. Everything is fine, and tomorrow, everyone will see my version is the correct one. They have to.
