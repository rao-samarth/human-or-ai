The hum of the party gravitated toward my cousin, Richard, who stood by the fireplace, gesturing with a wine glass as he recounted the clever details of his latest real estate deal. A small circle of aunts and uncles nodded, their expressions a mixture of admiration and envy. He was the measure of success in our family, the one whose stories were currency. I glanced out the sliding glass door to the patio, where Uncle Frank was sitting on the steps, away from the noise. He was showing my young niece how to find the North Star, even though the sun had barely set, pointing to invisible patterns in the pale blue sky. He spoke in a low murmur, his weathered hands steadying her small shoulders. The laughter from the living room was loud and confident, but Frank’s quiet lesson on navigating by something ancient and fixed felt like the only thing of real value happening that afternoon.
