The old stone wall, once the pride of his grandfather, was now surrendering to a slow, green tide of ivy. He ran a hand over the cool, damp stones, remembering the loud arguments in the kitchen, the booming voices that dismissed his quieter suggestions about proper maintenance and foresight as needless worry. They had always favored the quick fix, the loud pronouncement, the path of least resistance. Now, the sagging roof and the choked well were the quiet reply. He had built his own life differently, on a foundation of patience and careful thought, a life they had called dull. Standing there, amidst the gentle ruin wrought by their cheerful ignorance, he felt no sense of victory, only a profound and hollow ache. The wisdom he had cultivated had saved him, but it couldn't save this place, and the silence of the overgrown fields offered no congratulations, only the rustle of the wind through weeds.
