The shattering crash from the study silenced Uncle Barry’s story mid-sentence. We all froze, forks hovering over plates of half-eaten potato salad. My first thought was the cat, a notorious destroyer of heirlooms, but what stumbled through the doorway was far more absurd. Two figures, clad in mismatched black tracksuits and ski masks that looked suspiciously like repurposed winter hats, stood blinking in the light of the dining room. One of them held the mangled remains of Grandma’s favorite lamp, its cord wrapped around his ankle like a shackle. The other was hopelessly entangled in a string of decorative fairy lights, which flickered pathetically across his chest. He opened his mouth to shout, a command meant to instill terror, but instead let out a tremendous, dust-filled sneeze. A wave of stunned silence washed over us, a fragile moment before chaos. My heart hammered, not with fear, but with a wild, hysterical urge to laugh at the sheer patheticness of it all.
