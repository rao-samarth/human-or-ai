Don’t look so worried. The fact that our position feels so fragile is precisely what gives me hope. These offices, these titles—they were never meant to be permanent fixtures. They are held in trust, and that trust can be withdrawn just as quickly as it was given. Think of it not as a threat, but as a constant, necessary check on our own ambition. Power that can’t be lost isn’t leadership; it’s a prison, both for the ruler and the ruled. Our chance, the one thing our predecessors never grasped, is to build something that doesn’t depend on us holding on forever. We can create a foundation so resilient that it no longer matters who stands upon it. That is the only permanence worth striving for.
