You keep asking for a single point of failure, a specific moment I can admit to. There isn't one. It was never a sudden collapse or a dramatic betrayal you could pin on a calendar. It was more like water working its way into stone, a patient, grinding process that you don’t even notice until the foundation is dust. We made vows, sure. We built what we thought was a fortress, using the strongest commitments we had. But the years are relentless. They don’t need a battering ram; they just need a hairline fracture to begin their work. Everything we constructed, every memory we tried to preserve, has been worn smooth, eroded into something unrecognizable. This isn’t the aftermath of a decision. It’s simply what remains when an unstoppable force meets an object that only thought it was immovable.
