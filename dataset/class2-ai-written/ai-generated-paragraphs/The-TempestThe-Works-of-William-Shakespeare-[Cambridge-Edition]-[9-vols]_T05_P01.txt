You just don’t see it, do you? All this concrete, all these straight lines… they aren’t signs of strength to me. They’re just brittle. I keep thinking about the roots I saw splitting the pavement on the walk home, how they just don’t care about the grid we try to force onto everything. We build these perfect, sterile boxes for ourselves and then act surprised when we feel like we can't breathe. Everything is so loud, but nothing feels truly alive. I can feel the cracks forming in all this neatness, in me. Sometimes I just want to feel something grow without permission again.
