The long stone wall that bordered the meadow seemed, at first glance, to be a casualty of time. Its surface was a mosaic of missing stones and grey lichen, giving it the look of something surrendered to neglect. But to walk beside it was to discover its secret resilience. In every crevice, a miniature world thrived. Tiny, determined ferns unfurled from the damp cracks, and patches of deep green moss cushioned the stones like velvet. Bees hummed around small, purple wildflowers that had taken root in the most unlikely of places. The wall wasn't a ruin at all; it was a vertical garden, a bustling corridor for the small and the patient. It served as a quiet reminder that what looks like decay is often just the foundation for a new, more intricate kind of growth.
