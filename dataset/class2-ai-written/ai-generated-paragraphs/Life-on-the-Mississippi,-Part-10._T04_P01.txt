I do wish Gerard would stop inviting these technical types to his galas. They just stand near the canapés, discussing things like 'substrate integrity' while the rest of us are trying to have a civilized conversation. Take that woman by the pillar—the one in the drab grey suit. She hasn't made eye contact with a single influential person all night. But then, of course, the main projector flickered and died right before the big presentation. Panic. While everyone else just stared, she simply walked over, popped open a panel, and did something with a few wires. The whole thing took maybe thirty seconds. The image snapped back on, clearer than before. She just nodded at Gerard and faded back to her corner. It’s funny, isn’t it? How someone can be utterly useless for ninety-nine percent of an evening, and then suddenly become the only person in the room who actually matters.
