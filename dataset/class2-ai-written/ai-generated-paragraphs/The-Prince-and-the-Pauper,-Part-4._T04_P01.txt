Oh, forgive me if I’m not moved by your profound, heartfelt sympathy. It’s really quite a performance. You’ve got all the right words, the perfect concerned expression. It’s a neat little trick, isn’t it? To feel sorry for someone from a safe altitude, where the messiness can’t possibly touch you. You look down at the wreckage and think you understand the fall. But you don’t. You’ve only ever known smooth air. This isn't a story you can just comprehend; it’s a language you only learn when your own world is burning down around you. So please, spare me the patronizing kindness. You haven't earned the right to look at me with that pathetic pity in your eyes.
