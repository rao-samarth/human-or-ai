My aunt’s laugh rang out from the patio, and for a second, it sounded so much like my mother’s that my breath caught in my chest. I watched my nephew toddle through the overgrown rose bushes, the same ones she had planted decades ago, his small hands reaching for the bright petals. Everyone was here, scattered across the sun-drenched lawn. Yet the empty chair at the head of the picnic table felt like a physical presence, a quiet reminder of what isn't permanent. Seeing them all, so vibrant and so fleeting, solidified something I’d been wrestling with for months. It wasn't about grief anymore; it was about urgency. The half-finished business plan on my laptop transformed in my mind from a distant dream into an immediate necessity. A debt owed not just to a memory, but to the living, breathing people right in front of me. I would finish it. For her, and for them.
