I overheard the two women at the next table, one groaning about how she completely forgot her friend’s birthday. She was laughing about it, promising to make it up with dinner. A simple fix for a simple mistake. I almost envied her. My own ledger has an entry that can’t be balanced with a bottle of wine or a heartfelt apology. It’s not something I think about every minute, but it's always there, a low hum beneath the surface of my days. It’s the reason I can’t quite meet a stranger’s eyes, the reason my own reflection sometimes startles me. That one decision, made in a flicker of selfishness years ago, didn't just alter a moment; it redrew the entire map of my life. They talk about moving on, about time healing all wounds. But some things don’t heal. They just become a part of you, a permanent weight you learn to carry without wincing.
