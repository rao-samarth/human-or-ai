You told me this was peace, but I just saw him. Down by the water. The man who broke our world is over there skipping stones as if he were just any other soul, and my hands are still shaking. What was the point of any of it, then? All the lines we drew, the sacrifices, the years we spent trying to build something good while he tore it all down. Was it all just a temporary game with no final score? If his cruelty and our struggle both lead to this quiet shore, then this place isn’t a sanctuary. It’s an erasure of meaning, a grand indifference that makes a mockery of every choice we ever made. I don't know if I can stand in the same light as him and call it paradise.
