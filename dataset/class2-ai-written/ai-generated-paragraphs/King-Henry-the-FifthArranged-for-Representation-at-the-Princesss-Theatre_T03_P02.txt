The argument between Henderson of Henderson’s All-Day Breakfast and Mrs. Gable from The Gilded Bean across the street had reached its weekly crescendo, this time over the precise legal definition of a proprietary parking space. He insisted her customers were parking illegally; she retorted that his diner’s syrup-to-pancake ratio was a crime against humanity. The insults were just getting creative when a unified roar erupted from the sports bar down the block, a sound so immense it seemed to shake the very asphalt. A goal had been scored. In that single, electric moment, Henderson and Gable stopped mid-sentence, spun towards the sound, and let out whoops of their own. They exchanged a startlingly enthusiastic high-five, a pact of pure, unthinking joy. A beat of stunned silence followed as they remembered who they were. Henderson coughed, adjusted his apron, and suddenly decided Mrs. Gable’s prized petunias weren’t nearly as offensive as he’d thought five seconds ago.
