The hum of the refrigerator is the only thing moving in the dark. I was just looking at that family portrait on the wall, the one from last spring, and I couldn’t recognize us. Not really. It’s a picture of a successful man, a loving wife, a happy child. We held the poses perfectly, just like you’re supposed to. Everyone does. I see it now, all the time, in the way the mailman performs the role of ‘The Friendly Mailman’ or how the woman next door meticulously plays ‘The Concerned Neighbor.’ It’s a massive, silent agreement we all stumbled into, a stage where nobody has a script but everyone knows their lines. I sometimes feel the costume itch. I wonder if they can see me forgetting my cues, stumbling over a line I was supposed to have memorized at birth. What happens when the lights finally come up?
