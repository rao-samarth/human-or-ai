My cousin Brenda is holding court by the cheese platter, passionately explaining the geopolitical implications of a new stop sign on Elm Street. Everyone nods sagely, as if she's just decoded the enigma of global stability. It’s almost adorable. Meanwhile, I'm just trying to remember if the 'incredibly sensitive' file I reviewed this morning—the one detailing a certain diplomatic ‘misunderstanding’ that could easily ignite a continental conflict—was encrypted with the old algorithm or the new one that our adversaries probably cracked last Tuesday. Uncle Dave is complaining about the price of gas, blissfully unaware that the whole energy market is propped up by a lie so fragile, a single, well-placed tweet could shatter it. Oh, but please, Brenda, do go on about the traffic flow. It's so reassuring to know that while the world teeters on a precipice of manufactured consent and classified incompetence, we're focused on the real issues.
