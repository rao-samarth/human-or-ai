The house is finally quiet, with only the refrigerator humming its low, constant note. I'm standing in the kitchen under the single dim light above the sink, and everything is spotless. The counters gleam, the dishes are neatly stacked away, the floor is swept clean. To anyone peeking in, this is a picture of serene, domestic order. They wouldn't know that just a few hours ago, this room was a whirlwind of chaos. Voices bounced off these walls, sharp and loud, and a coffee mug shattered on that now-pristine tile. I scrubbed it all away, erasing the evidence until my hands were sore. It’s strange how you can physically tidy up a storm, leaving behind a silence that feels more like a held breath than actual peace. This perfect order feels like its own kind of lie, a neatly arranged cage for the mess that’s still screaming inside.
