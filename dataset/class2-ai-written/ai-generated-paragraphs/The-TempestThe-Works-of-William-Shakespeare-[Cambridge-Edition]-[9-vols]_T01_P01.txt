You don’t get it. I had the perfect plan, every last detail worked out to bring them to their knees, to make them feel a fraction of the pain they caused me. I held that plan like a sharp, precious stone in my hand for so long, ready to throw it with all my might. But the other day, I saw my own reflection, and I didn't recognize the person staring back. The hate had carved new lines around my eyes. It was a poison, and I was the one drinking it every single morning, expecting them to die. That isn't justice; it's just a slow, miserable suicide. So I opened my hand. I just let the stone drop, right there on the pavement. This was never about them deserving peace. It’s about me finally claiming my own.
