From the quiet laneway, one can survey the entire plot and see the ghost of its original design. The old stone walls, meant to provide structure and defense, are crumbling in places, allowing brambles to creep in from the wilder edges. It is not an abandoned space; there is activity, but it feels strangely directed. The caretakers spend their days meticulously pruning a few ornamental shrubs near the gatehouse, a performance of diligence for any passersby, while vast sections of what were once productive beds are now overcome with nettles and bittercress. Hardy, established perennials are being choked out by aggressive newcomers that thrive in the depleted soil. The irrigation lines seem to have been rerouted to water the gravel paths, leaving the most promising blossoms to wilt on the vine. It’s a place of selective, bewildering effort.
