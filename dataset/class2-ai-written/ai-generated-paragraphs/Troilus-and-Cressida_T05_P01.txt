Everyone here saw us make that promise. They were sitting in the same pews they sit in every Sunday, right behind my mother. We said the words, and I believed them. I truly did. But a promise isn't a stone wall you build once and leave standing; it’s more like a garden fence you have to keep patching. A board rots here, a nail rusts there. You tell yourself you’ll fix it tomorrow. Then one day, the whole thing just gives way, and you're standing on opposite sides of the ruin, wondering when the collapse actually started. People talk, of course. In a town this size, they always do. They think it was one storm that did it, one big event. They’re wrong. It was the quiet, steady rain we both ignored for years.
