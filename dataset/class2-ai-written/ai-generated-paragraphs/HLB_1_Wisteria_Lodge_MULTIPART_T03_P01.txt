Sitting at this small café on the edge of the old quarter, you can see the exact line where history was violently redrawn. To my left, the buildings are a chaotic jumble of centuries, with ornate balconies and faded pastel facades. To my right, across a street that feels more like a scar, stands a monotonous grid of concrete apartments from a later, harsher era. A local guide had explained it yesterday with a shrug; the families who lived in the original grand houses on that side were systematically removed during the purges decades ago. It wasn't just their lives, but their very homes and businesses that were deemed ideologically unsound and eventually demolished. That single, vindictive decision, made by a committee in a distant capital, continues to shape the daily view for everyone here. The descendants of those families now live on other continents, carrying fragmented memories of a place that physically rejected their ancestors. It’s a quiet reminder that a political grudge, once set in motion, doesn’t simply end with a generation; it becomes part of the soil, the architecture, and the silence in certain conversations for a long time to come.
