For three months, I'd been telling everyone at my new job that I spoke fluent Swedish. It was a stupid, pointless lie born from a moment of panic when my boss asked if anyone had any "interesting hidden talents." It never came up, so I figured I was safe. Then the Stockholm-based investors decided to visit our Manhattan office. Suddenly, I was being ushered into the main conference room to "help translate and build a rapport." There I was, standing in front of two very polite, very Swedish executives who were smiling at me expectantly. My boss gave me a proud nod. I opened my mouth and the only thing that came out was the name of an Ikea bookshelf—"Billy"—followed by a panicked noise that sounded vaguely like a panicked moose. The awkward silence was so thick you could have built a flat-pack wardrobe out of it. I've never updated my resume so fast in my life.
