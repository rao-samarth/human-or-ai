I saw the final presentation, and I have to admit, you delivered it well. You always were the better speaker. But what I can't get out of my head are the slides filled with words we scribbled on napkins during that late night last month. I remember telling you things about the initial concept I hadn't even told my own manager, because I thought we were building this together, side-by-side. You even used the little anecdote about my grandfather, the one I shared when we were stuck for a new angle. Now I have to sit in these meetings, listening to people praise *your* vision, and nod along. The worst part isn't the stolen credit; that’s just business, I guess. It’s knowing that every confidential coffee and every shared doubt was just material for you. It’s that you listened so carefully, but not as a partner.
