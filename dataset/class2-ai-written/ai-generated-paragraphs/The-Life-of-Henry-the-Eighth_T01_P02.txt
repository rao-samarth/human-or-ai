The smell of charcoal and cut grass filled the air, a perfect Sunday. My niece, sticky with watermelon, offered me a lopsided paper crown she’d made. Just as I was about to place it on my head, my phone gave a single, insistent vibration against my hip—the one I’m never supposed to ignore. I stepped away from the laughter, turning my back to the patio as the aide’s voice came through my earpiece, a sterile whisper of catastrophe. Two operatives, stranded. A clean extraction is impossible. Leave them, and they are ghosts by morning. Go in, and the carefully constructed peace with a volatile neighbor shatters, with consequences I can’t fully predict. I watch my own son chase a stray balloon across the lawn, his joy so absolute, so fragile. The aide is waiting for my command. My brother-in-law shouts from the grill, asking if I want ketchup or mustard, and I have to somehow make my mouth form a normal answer while deciding which world to burn.
