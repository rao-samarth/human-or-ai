Watching the slow train snake through the valley, I considered the markers we use to chart human progress. We so often equate it with speed, with monumental construction, with the sheer volume of data we can generate and store. We build our cities ever higher, convinced that this vertical ambition is the primary measure of an advanced society. Yet from this window, I see villages that have followed the contours of the land for a thousand years, their permanence rooted not in concrete but in a complex understanding of seasons and soil. They have no skyscrapers, but their social structures are resilient and their knowledge of the local ecology is encyclopedic. It’s hard not to wonder if we’ve confused scale with substance, mistaking the architecture of dominance for the art of endurance.
