The old stone wall was still warm from the afternoon sun, a comfortable perch overlooking the quiet fields. “Did you see the news about that actor’s collapse?” Liam asked, scrolling through his phone. “The footage is everywhere.” Elias sighed, taking a slow sip of water from his bottle. “I saw the headline. They gave it a solid ten minutes of airtime, complete with breathless speculation.” He gestured with his chin towards the valley below, where a new line of power pylons was being constructed. “I was more interested in the new energy infrastructure vote, the one that’ll affect everyone down there. Did they cover that?” Liam looked up, his screen forgotten for a moment. “An energy vote? No, I don’t think so.” Elias nodded slowly. “Of course not. It’s far easier to fill the hour with a celebrity’s personal drama than to explain grid logistics. Just a brighter, louder noise to keep us from listening for anything else.”
