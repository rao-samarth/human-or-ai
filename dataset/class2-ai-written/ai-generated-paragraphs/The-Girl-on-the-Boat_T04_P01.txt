On a long train journey through an unfamiliar landscape, you often see them. The ones who seem to have missed the memo on how to be a proper, serious adult. They might be sketching absurd little creatures in a notebook or humming a tune completely out of key, blissfully unaware of the mild annoyance they cause. It’s easy to dismiss them as simpletons, people who just don’t understand the weight of the world. Yet, as the miles blur by, a different thought takes hold. Perhaps they are the only ones who truly grasp the point of the journey. While the rest of us are busy calculating arrival times and worrying about missed connections, they are collecting moments. They are the ones who will stumble off the train, not with a sense of weary accomplishment, but with pockets full of useless, beautiful things and a story that makes no practical sense but feels entirely true. Their success is a quiet, uncelebrated one, found not at the destination, but in every clumsy, joyful step taken along the way.
