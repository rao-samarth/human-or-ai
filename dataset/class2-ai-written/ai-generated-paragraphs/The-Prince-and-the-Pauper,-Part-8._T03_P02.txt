The house is so quiet now, just the low hum of the fridge. I hung up with my friend an hour ago, but I can still hear the tremor in their voice. A few years back, I would have flooded them with solutions, with bright-sided nonsense about everything happening for a reason. I would have meant well, of course, but it would have been useless, a hollow echo. It’s strange how you can’t truly understand what it means to be in the dark until you’ve been there yourself, fumbling for a light switch that doesn’t exist. My own floor fell out from under me once, and the people who helped most weren't the ones with answers. They were the ones who just sat with me in the rubble. Tonight, I didn’t offer any advice. I just listened. It felt like the only honest thing to do, the only real kindness I had to give. That broken part of me recognized the same fracture in them.
