The new neighbor, a man built like a refrigerator, thought his sheer size and booming voice were enough to own the block. His dog, a poorly trained mastiff, certainly behaved that way, treating every lawn as its own and every passerby as a potential threat. Complaints were met with sneers and dismissive gestures. Direct confrontation only seemed to embolden him. So, the retired cartographer next door began a different kind of project. For two weeks, he quietly mapped the dog’s transgressions, his logbook filled with precise times, annotated photographs, and cross-referenced citations of local leash laws and property ordinances. He never raised his voice or knocked on the man’s door. Instead, he simply mailed a neatly compiled, undeniable portfolio of evidence to the town clerk. The fines that followed, clinical and inescapable, achieved what shouting never could: a new fence went up the very next weekend.
