The long grass whispers against my boots, each stalk bending in a breeze that carries the scent of damp soil and clover. Here, life is a simple, relentless cycle of growth and decay, utterly unconcerned with human ambition. An ant colony builds its intricate city in the dirt, its citizens driven by an instinct I can almost understand. It is a logic of survival, of continuation. But then I think of men digging trenches in fields just like this one, not for shelter but for slaughter. They fill the air not with the hum of bees but with the shriek of metal, motivated by ideas scrawled on paper and proclaimed from podiums. They invent gods and flags to sanctify the tearing of flesh, turning vibrant fields into silent, muddy graves. The wind doesn't care about their reasons, and the grass will eventually grow over the bones all the same, covering the evidence of a madness that mistook itself for purpose.
