From the train, the long, ugly scar running through the forest looked like pure destruction. It was a firebreak, a deliberate wound carved into the landscape. They must have cleared hundreds, perhaps thousands, of perfectly healthy trees to create that barren strip of earth. At first, the logic feels inverted, a preemptive act of violence against the very thing it’s meant to protect. Yet, the emptiness is the point. It’s a calculated loss, a zone where a potential wildfire can be starved of fuel. A small, defined section is sacrificed so the vast remainder might endure. It’s a strange and dispassionate calculus, one that places the survival of the system far above the existence of its individual components.
