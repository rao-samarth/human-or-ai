Oh, look at him, the man of the hour, basking in the warm glow of all this manufactured admiration. It must be wonderful to stand at the summit of a mountain you’ve built from the bones of your competitors. That smile doesn't quite reach his eyes, does it? It’s a well-rehearsed curve of the lips, a tool as sharp and practical as any in his arsenal. He’s already scanning the room, not for friends, of course, but for the next rung on the ladder, the next useful connection. Everyone here applauds the ascent, conveniently ignoring the trail of wreckage he left behind because they’re all hoping to learn the trick of it. I suppose the view from the top is spectacular, so long as you’re careful not to look down at what you’re standing on.
