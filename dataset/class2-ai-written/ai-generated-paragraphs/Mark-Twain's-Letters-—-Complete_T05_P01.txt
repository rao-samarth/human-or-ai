It’s so quiet here, just the wind through the grass. The silence makes me remember the noise, the constant, underlying hum of a city—any city, really. I used to chase the differences, the things that made each place feel alien: the language, the scent of the food stalls, the architecture. And those things are real, of course. But after a while, you start to see past them to a universal rhythm. I’ve seen the same focused expression on morning commuters, whether they’re on a scooter in Hanoi or a crowded train in Tokyo. I’ve heard the same kind of laughter from teenagers in a park in Buenos Aires that you'd hear anywhere. The famous views are for the camera, but what truly stays with you is the unchanging human stuff: a mother instinctively fixing her child’s collar, the comfortable quiet between old friends at a café. It’s all the same story, just told in a different dialect.
