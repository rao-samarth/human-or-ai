No, listen to me, this is critical. When he asks, we were not at The Salty Pretzel. We were at The Salty *Seagull*, which is a completely different, tragically-named pub in that little town by the coast. Yes, I know it's a ninety-minute drive. That's the genius of it. We say we went for their famous clam chowder, got a flat tire on the way back, and had no phone signal. It explains everything. The photo he saw? That was from last week; I just posted it late to confuse the algorithm, or something equally plausible. It’s either we commit to this story—the mythical pub, the tire, the terrible chowder—or we admit we’d rather face a public audit than attend another one of his 'interpretive haiku' nights. This is our only play.
