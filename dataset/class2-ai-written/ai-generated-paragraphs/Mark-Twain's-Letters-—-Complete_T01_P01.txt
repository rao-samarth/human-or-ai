Look, I get it. I see the same spreadsheets you do, and trust me, I've had my share of nights staring at the ceiling, re-calculating everything in my head until the numbers just blur together. It feels like we're standing at the edge of a cliff, doesn't it? But we can't just focus on the drop. Think about what we're building here, piece by piece. This isn't just about scraping by next month; it's about creating something that will sustain us for years, something that's entirely ours. Every single invoice we send out, every new client we land, that's another stone laid in the foundation. It’s slow, and it’s scary, but it’s real. We just have to keep believing in the blueprint, even when the work is hard. We’ll make it work.
