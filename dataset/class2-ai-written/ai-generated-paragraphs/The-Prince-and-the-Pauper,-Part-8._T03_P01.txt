You keep calling their empathy a kind of naivety, a weakness even. But I think that’s a perspective that comes from never having your own world completely fall apart. It’s simple to draw firm lines in the sand, to judge others, when your own ground has always felt solid beneath you. You can afford the luxury of certainty. When you’ve been through a genuine collapse, though—when you’ve had to piece things back together from absolute fragments—you lose the instinct for harsh judgment. You stop seeing people’s mistakes as simple failures of character. Instead, you start to recognize the fault lines, the hidden fractures in them that mirror your own. It's not about pity. It’s a form of quiet, structural recognition; you simply see the same fragile architecture everywhere.
