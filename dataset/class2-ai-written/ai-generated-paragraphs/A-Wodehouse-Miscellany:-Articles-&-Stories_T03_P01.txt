So there I was, at two in the morning, staring into the dusty abyss behind the washing machine. My left earbud was down there, a tiny white speck of my own stupidity, all because I tried to dust with a broom handle instead of just moving the heavy appliance like a normal person. I’d already spent ten minutes fruitlessly poking at it with a bent coat hanger, which only pushed it further away. Moving the machine was out of the question; it weighs a ton. Defeated, I slumped against the kitchen counter, and then my eyes landed on the utensil drawer. A sudden, brilliant idea. I grabbed a long bamboo skewer and a roll of heavy-duty packing tape. After creating a sticky, makeshift grabbing tool on the skewer's tip, I carefully navigated it into the darkness. A few tense moments of probing, and then—contact. I slowly reeled it in, the earbud stuck to the end like a prize. For a second, I felt like the smartest person on earth.
