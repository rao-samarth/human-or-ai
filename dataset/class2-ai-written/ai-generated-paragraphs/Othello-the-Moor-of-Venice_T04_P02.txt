I’m out here by the old stone wall, watching the wind move through the long grass in waves. You know how it looks from a distance—solid, permanent, something you could lean against forever. But when you get close, you see the moss has loosened the mortar, and a single careless kick could send a dozen stones tumbling into the field. It makes me think of all the talk back home. A lifetime of careful work, of being the person everyone could count on, and all it takes is one whisper, one misplaced word carried on the breeze like a thistle seed. Suddenly, the whole structure feels compromised. People start looking at the cracks instead of the wall itself, and you realize with a sudden chill just how little was holding it all together in the first place. It’s all just trust, and that’s as fragile as a dry-stone fence in a storm.
