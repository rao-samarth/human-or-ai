The clink of champagne flutes seemed impossibly loud as I watched him from across the ballroom. He was laughing with his daughter, a small girl in a velvet dress who looked up at him with total adoration. In my pocket, my phone felt like a stone, heavy with the file that would utterly dismantle his career, his reputation, everything. Every regulation, every code of conduct I had ever sworn to uphold screamed for me to simply forward the document to the board. It was justice, clean and absolute. But the man in the file wasn’t laughing; he was a cold list of violations, a summary of professional ruin. The rules demanded a reckoning. His daughter didn’t. My thumb hovered over the screen, a tiny god weighing a man's future, while the orchestra played on, completely unaware of the verdict being decided in the silent space of a single breath.
