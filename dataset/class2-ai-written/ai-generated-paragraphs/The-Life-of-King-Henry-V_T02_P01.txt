The man at the next table couldn't have been more than eighteen, his voice ringing with a conviction only the young can muster. He spoke of purpose, of standing for something, his words painting pictures of crisp uniforms and grateful homecomings. His companion, a much older man with deep lines around his eyes, just stirred his coffee, the spoon clinking softly against the ceramic. When the boy finally paused for breath, the older man looked not at him, but out the rain-streaked window. “They don’t tell you about the noise,” he said, his voice low and gravelly. “Not the bangs, everyone expects those. It’s the other things. The sound of zippers on body bags. The way the radios crackle with static where a voice used to be.” He took a slow sip. The silence that followed was heavier than any sound, and I watched the heroic posture slowly seep out of the young man’s shoulders.
