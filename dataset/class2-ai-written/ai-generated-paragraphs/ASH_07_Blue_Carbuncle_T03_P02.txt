His voice was low, cutting through the late-night silence of the kitchen. "You keep waiting for me to fail again, don't you?" She flinched, her back still to him as she stared at the dark window over the sink. "Every time I do something right, I see it in your eyes—that flicker of surprise, like you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop." She turned slowly, her hands dripping water onto the floor. "That's not fair." "Isn't it?" he pressed, taking a step closer. "You said you were giving me another chance, but you never actually let me have it. You're holding the memory of who I was against the person I have spent every single day since then trying to become. This life, this quiet house… none of it is real to you, is it? It's just a temporary reprieve. When do I get to be the person I am now?"
