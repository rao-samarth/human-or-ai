The living room buzzed with the comfortable chaos of family until Uncle Marcus returned from the patio. He thumped his prize from the jungle dig onto the glass coffee table: a squat, ugly idol carved from dull, porous stone that seemed to absorb the lamplight. “Keeps the bad spirits away,” he chuckled, but his eyes had a strange, fixed glaze. The dog whined, backing under a chair. Marcus began to hum, a low, guttural melody that didn't fit the cheerful room. It grew louder, a chant. Abruptly, he snatched the brass poker from the fireplace stand. A gasp rippled through the room. He lunged, swinging the poker in a wild arc. It connected with the large family portrait above the mantelpiece, shattering the glass in a deafening crack. Shards rained down on the hearth as his chant filled the sudden, terrified silence.
