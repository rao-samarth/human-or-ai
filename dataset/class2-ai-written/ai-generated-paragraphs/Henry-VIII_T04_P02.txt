From this moving window, the distant peaks look like invitations. We see them and imagine ourselves at the summit, having conquered the steep climb and the thin air. It’s a fundamental human drive, isn’t it? To build higher, to reach further, to etch our name on something permanent. But in the desperate scramble for the pinnacle, we often forget the base. We use unsteady materials for the foundation because all our focus is directed at the spire, and we mistake speed for strength. The real tragedy isn't failing to reach the top; it’s reaching it, or getting agonizingly close, only to feel the entire structure groan beneath you. In that moment, you realize the frantic upward momentum was the only thing holding it all together, and the drop is so much further than you ever imagined.
