In the great, anonymous river of the city, where everyone rushes along prescribed currents, a certain few in any family act as deliberate eddies. They are the ones who will stop mid-stride on a crowded pavement to admire the iridescence on a puddle, or who hold earnest, one-sided conversations with statues in the park. Their logic operates on a different plane, one where the color of your socks is more important than the time on your watch and where a sudden burst of song on a packed train is a perfectly reasonable response to a passing thought. Society might label this eccentricity, a harmless deviation from the norm. But to be near it is to be reminded that the rigid structure we build around our lives is a choice, not a necessity. Their gentle, joyful chaos is a quiet rebellion, suggesting that the most profound way to navigate the concrete maze is to occasionally get wonderfully, brilliantly lost.
