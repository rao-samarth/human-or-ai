The house is so quiet at this hour. Everyone else is asleep, and they can afford to be. I hear the whispers, of course—the talk of harsh measures, of lines being crossed. But these critics see a simple world of polite rules that no longer apply. They don't grasp the immense weight of true responsibility, the necessity of making decisions that would shatter weaker people. They see a hand tightening its grip, but I know it is merely a hand providing structure where there was chaos. It’s a lonely clarity, understanding that for the herd to remain safe, the shepherd must sometimes be severe. Let them sleep. Their peace is the only validation I require.
