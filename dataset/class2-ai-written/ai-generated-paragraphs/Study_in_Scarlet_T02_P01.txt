A sharp creak echoed from downstairs, slicing through the midnight silence. A lesser mind might imagine intruders, ghosts, the thrilling start of some domestic horror. I, however, am cursed with the tedious burden of logic. The sound originated from the third floorboard to the left of the armchair, a spot I know has a slight warp from last winter's leak. Its specific timbre, a sharp pop rather than a groan, indicates a rapid pressure shift. A burglar would be more cautious. The house settling is a slow, mournful process. That leaves only one culprit, whose weight is precisely enough to trigger that exact acoustic response: the cat, making its dramatic leap from the sofa. A truly stunning intellectual breakthrough. I should probably alert the scientific community to my groundbreaking discovery about the physics of a six-kilogram animal landing on old wood. They’ll surely be fascinated.
