You should see Uncle Robert over by the grill. It’s been twenty years since that whole business with Dad’s company, and the courts never touched him; he got to keep the money, the house, everything. But look at him now. No one makes eye contact for more than a second. Aunt Carol offers him a potato salad with the same forced smile she uses for strangers, and the kids, who don't even know the story, seem to sense he's an island and give him a wide berth. He won his legal battle, I suppose, but what did he really win? He's a ghost at his own family party. He’s serving a different kind of sentence, a life sentence of polite exclusion, and I wonder if he even understands that this is his punishment, slow and quiet and handed down not by a judge, but by all of us, every single holiday.
