The plan had been simple: a grand, multi-course dinner prepared by everyone. My aunt, armed with a laminated recipe she’d printed from the internet, tried to direct the culinary traffic. But my cousins treated "a pinch of salt" as a creative suggestion, not a measurement, and my uncle decided the sauce needed a "secret ingredient" which turned out to be hot sauce. Flour dusted every surface like a fine winter snow. For a moment, standing in the doorway of the smoking kitchen, it felt like a complete failure. Yet, as we sat on the floor an hour later, sharing greasy slices of delivery pizza amidst the wreckage, a different kind of warmth filled the room. Laughter echoed off the flour-covered cabinets. The disastrous attempt to orchestrate a perfect meal had somehow created an even better memory, one built not on precision, but on the happy, messy reality of just being together.
