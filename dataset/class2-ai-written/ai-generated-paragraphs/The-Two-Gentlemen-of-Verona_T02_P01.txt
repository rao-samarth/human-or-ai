I was just trying to get some work done at that little cafe on the corner, but the couple at the next table were practically broadcasting. They were mapping out their whole lives, right there over two lattes. A dog first, then the apartment with the big windows. So much certainty. It was almost painful to listen to, honestly, not because it was annoying, but because it was so familiar. I remember that feeling, that absolute conviction that you’ve built something permanent, a fortress for two. You think your particular brand of affection is immune to the usual erosion that wears other people down. But it isn't a fortress. It's more like a current, powerful and all-consuming one moment, and then the tide just… goes out. You’re left standing on the sand, wondering where the ocean went. They’ll find out. Or maybe they won’t. Who knows?
