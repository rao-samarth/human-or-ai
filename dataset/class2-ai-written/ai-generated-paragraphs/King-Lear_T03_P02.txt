I saw you on the subway platform last Tuesday, across the tracks at Union Square. You were looking at your phone, and for a second, I almost called out your name. But what would I have said? What is there left to say that wouldn't fit in one of those cold, polite emails we exchange twice a year, full of updates that feel like they’re about someone else’s life? It feels like we're all just strangers now, sharing a last name and a few faded photographs. Mom doesn’t even ask about you anymore, not really. It’s just easier that way, I suppose. It’s just strange to stand among a million people and feel the loneliest I’ve ever been, knowing the one person I used to tell everything to is only a hundred feet away, a stranger on the opposite side of the tracks.
