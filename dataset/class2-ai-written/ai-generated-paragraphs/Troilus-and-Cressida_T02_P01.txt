You know, we used to think it was all about the grand gestures, the kind of love that felt like a movie script. We mapped our future on that idea, believing passion alone could pave over any cracks. But look at that couple by the window. He just wordlessly passed her the sugar, and she gently brushed some lint off his shoulder. There's no soaring music there. I bet they've weathered terrible arguments, money scares, and the slow, grinding exhaustion of just being people. I think we all have a moment where the beautiful, fragile idea of love we started with simply shatters under the weight of real life. But seeing them, I don’t think that’s the end. I think that’s the beginning. It's where you stop performing love and start living it, finding a quiet strength in the pieces that remain. That’s the part I’m starting to believe in.
