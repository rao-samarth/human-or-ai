I sometimes walk out to the old property line, where the stone wall my grandfather built has mostly collapsed into a jagged ribbon of moss and rock. My uncle refused to maintain his half because my father wouldn't admit he was wrong about the deed, and my father let his side crumble just to spite him. They spent decades arguing over a few feet of dirt. Now, the fields they both loved are choked with thorns, the barn is just a skeleton against the sky, and we don't even speak at funerals anymore. All that inheritance, all that history, just dissolved into bitter silence and overgrown land. It’s funny, in a bleak way. They thought they were fighting for their share, but all they managed to do was poison the well for everyone.
