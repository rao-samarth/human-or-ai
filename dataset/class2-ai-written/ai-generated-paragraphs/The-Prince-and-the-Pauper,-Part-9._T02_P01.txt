Oh, spare me the soul-searching. You think anyone actually cares about the “real you” hiding under all that? It’s hilarious. We are what people see, and that’s the beginning and end of it. Your carefully chosen haircut, the brand of your shoes, the practiced, non-threatening smile you flash at the right people—that's your entire biography written in a language everyone understands. They don't read your diary; they read your jacket. You could have the inner life of a poet, a revolutionary, a saint, but if you show up looking like a middle manager, guess what? You're a middle manager. All that deep, complex stuff you treasure is just private, useless background noise. The performance is the person, darling. Get used to it.
