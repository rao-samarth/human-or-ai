From this high up, the perpetual traffic on the avenues looks like a sluggish, metallic river, and the people are just specks of color rushing along the sidewalks. They talk about principle in the quiet, wood-paneled rooms, about holding some pure, unwavering line against the tide. A lovely thought for a book, but entirely useless down there in the exhaust and the noise. They call my recent decision a concession, a dirty bargain, but what good is a clean conscience that doesn't keep a single light on or put food on one of those microscopic tables? Their idealism is a luxury, a self-congratulatory pose that accomplishes nothing. I chose the bridge, the budget, the tangible thing. Someone has to be willing to trade a piece of their supposed soul to actually make the gears of this city turn. It isn’t a betrayal of values; it’s an acknowledgement of reality.
