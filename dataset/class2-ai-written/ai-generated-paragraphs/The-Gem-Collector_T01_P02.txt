The low hum of conversation filled the living room, a familiar soundtrack to these gatherings. My uncle held court by the fireplace, his voice booming as he recounted a triumphant business deal, and everyone laughed on cue. I watched his wife smile, but her hand, resting on her wine glass, had a slight, persistent tremor. My younger cousin, who always seemed so effortlessly bright, kept checking her phone under the table, her brow furrowed for a split second before she would look up and join the laughter again. We were all playing our assigned roles so well. I felt the muscles in my own face ache from holding a pleasant, neutral expression. It was a strange sort of silent agreement we all shared, to perform these comfortable versions of ourselves for one another, leaving the tired, real people locked away somewhere else for the evening. We built these characters for each other, and it felt too late, and far too lonely, to ever let them go.
