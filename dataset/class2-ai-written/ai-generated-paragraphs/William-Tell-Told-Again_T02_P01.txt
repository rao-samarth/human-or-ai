Everyone’s talking about Elias Finch and his front door, of course. The unspoken rule here is earth tones, shades of quiet living that blend into the hills. But his door is a shocking, brilliant red, the kind of color that doesn't ask for permission. He claims it's about 'self-expression,' which is what people say when they want to be difficult. I saw him on his porch this morning, just drinking his coffee as if nothing was wrong, as if the whole neighborhood wasn’t whispering. People slow their cars when they pass, not in admiration, but with a kind of pitying curiosity, the way you’d look at a lost dog. He thinks he’s making a statement, a stand for something, but all he’s really doing is making things awkward for the rest of us. He’ll learn. They always do.
