You keep saying it was meant to be, as if that absolves us, as if some grand design forced our hand at every critical turn. But I was there. I remember the exact moment we chose this path, the silent weight of that single decision resting entirely on our shoulders. Was that not real? Perhaps the destination was always set, a fixed point on a map we couldn't erase. Fine. But every step we took to get there, every stumble and every shortcut, that was all us. We can’t just point to the heavens and claim we were puppets dancing on strings we didn't pull. We made the choice. We accepted the cost, even if we didn't understand it then. The consequences are ours to carry, not some abstract cosmic plan’s.
