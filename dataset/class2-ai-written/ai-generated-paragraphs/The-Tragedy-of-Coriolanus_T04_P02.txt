The cheer for the prize-winning pumpkin was still echoing off the brick town hall when the first shout came. It was a single, sharp accusation from the back. A hush fell, thick and sudden, smothering the celebration. Necks craned. Laughter died on a hundred lips, replaced by a low, inquisitive murmur that quickly soured. Faces that had been open and smiling just moments before now hardened, twisting into masks of suspicion. It started with a pointing finger, then another. The friendly press of neighbors became a threatening weight, a single body shifting its focus. A woman near me, who had been handing out candy, now gripped her bag tightly, her knuckles white. The air, once filled with the scent of fried dough and autumn leaves, turned electric and smelled of pure menace. The crowd was no longer a collection of people; it had become one single, hungry organism, and it was starting to move.
