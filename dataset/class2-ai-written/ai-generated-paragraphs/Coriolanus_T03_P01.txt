He sits astride his bronze horse in the center of the square, a hero cast in permanent silence. I remember the stories, the way the city once spoke his name with a kind of reverence, his dedication celebrated with parades that clogged these very streets. That fervor is now a faint echo, lost in the shriek of bus brakes and the anonymous hum of a million private conversations. The crowds still surge around his plinth, a river of people flowing toward newer, taller monuments of glass and steel. They don't look up anymore. His outstretched hand, once a symbol of bold leadership, now seems to be pleading, pointing at nothing of consequence while pigeons author their own messy history on his shoulders. A discarded coffee cup rests near the tarnished plaque detailing a victory no one has time to consider.
