The last of the gilded guests have departed, leaving behind a battlefield of half-eaten delicacies and abandoned crystal. My job is to clear it all away, but my hand has frozen over a linen napkin. Beneath it, a single earring glitters with a cold, insistent light. It feels heavy in my palm, heavier than just gold and stone. I remember the woman who sat here, laughing about the inconvenience of a customs delay on her private jet. That single, forgotten trinket is worth more than the procedure my father has been putting off for six months. The lost-and-found box is in the manager's office. My pocket is right here. No one is watching. The thumping in my chest feels loud enough to echo through the empty ballroom as I weigh a stranger’s careless loss against a tangible, desperate need.
