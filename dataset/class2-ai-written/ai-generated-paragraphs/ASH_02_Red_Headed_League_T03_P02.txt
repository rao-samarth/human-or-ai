The Beast was screaming again. Pages spewed from its maw, not spreadsheets, not memos, but lines of jagged, incomprehensible symbols that looked vaguely ancient. Maria yanked the power cord, but the queue was already poisoned, the network flooded with nonsense. We spread the sheets across the conference table, a chaotic mosaic of what some intern swore was proto-Norse. Panic was setting in; theories flew from a targeted hack to a genuine haunting of the third floor. I dove into the server logs, frantically scrolling through a firehose of print jobs, my heart pounding against my ribs. Every entry looked normal, just text files and PDFs. Then I saw it, almost invisible between hundreds of corporate reports: a single, tiny job from the design department labeled "font_test_archaic.ttf". A corrupted file. It wasn't a curse from a digital Viking; it was just a bad download.
