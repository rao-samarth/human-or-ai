The coffee shop was loud, full of the clatter of ceramic and strangers’ conversations, but I leaned across the tiny table, trying to find the right words. “It wasn’t one specific moment,” I said, my voice lower than the surrounding noise. “It was more like a gradual change in focus. For a long time, you were just the best part of my day. Fun. Easy. Then one afternoon I was trying to picture my future, and I couldn't get a clear image. It was just a blur. But when I tried picturing it with you in it, suddenly everything snapped into high-definition. You went from being my favorite companion to being the lens through which I see everything else. All the years before you feel like a prologue to the actual story.” I only realized I’d been talking a little too earnestly when I saw the woman at the next table lower her book, a soft, knowing smile on her face. She just gave a tiny nod, as if she understood completely.
