You don’t just get to walk back in here. I grieved you. Not like you were dead, which might have been cleaner, but like you were a limb I had to learn to live without. Every empty chair at a table, every song we used to know—that was my reality. I spent a decade rebuilding everything on the foundation of your absence. And now you’re standing in my kitchen, asking for a glass of water as if you were only gone for an afternoon. I never meant for… Don't. Just don't. Of all the people on this planet, after all this silence, you appear on my street. I don’t know whether to scream at you or collapse from the sheer impossibility of it.
