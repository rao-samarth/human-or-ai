My aunt is holding my arm, her grip surprisingly firm as she tells my uncle how “vibrant” I look. My cousin nods along, adding that he’s never seen me this happy. They are all celebrating this person I’ve become, this stranger in brighter colors and a smaller size, and the praise should feel good, shouldn’t it? Instead, a strange loyalty to the girl I was six months ago twists in my gut. Was her quiet contentment not real enough for them? Was she just a draft they’re glad I’ve finally revised? They are complimenting a shell, attributing a whole new personality to it based on its shape and gloss. I want to explain that I am still her, just in a different package, but the words feel defensive and ungrateful. So I just smile, letting them congratulate me on an erasure they mistake for a discovery, and feel a part of myself quietly disappear under the weight of their approval.
