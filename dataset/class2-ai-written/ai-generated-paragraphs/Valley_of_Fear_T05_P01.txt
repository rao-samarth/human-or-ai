You keep looking for someone who doesn’t exist anymore. You talk about her like she's just on vacation, like she'll be back if you just wait long enough at the right station. But I'm telling you, the house is empty. The windows are boarded up. I know it's easier for you to believe I was stolen or that I've lost my mind, because the alternative is admitting that she chose to leave. She walked out one morning and simply dissolved into the rain. Every piece of this new life—this boring job, this tiny apartment, the way I drink my coffee now—was a brick I had to lay myself to build a wall so high she could never climb back over. So please, stop calling her name. She can't hear you.
