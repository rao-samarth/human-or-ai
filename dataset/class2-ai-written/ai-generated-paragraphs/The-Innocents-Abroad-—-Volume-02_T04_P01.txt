It’s amusing, isn't it, watching everyone here, staring at these glass cases with such reverence. They see gilded saints and stoic philosophers, the foundations of our world. They don’t see the grimy, terrified men who cobbled these ideas together out of sheer desperation and political expedience. Every sacred text began as a committee memo; every prophet was likely just a charismatic madman who got lucky. We sanitize it all, of course. We have to. We polish the brute facts of our origins until they gleam like this marble floor, creating a story so clean and noble that we can stand on it without getting our expensive shoes dirty.
