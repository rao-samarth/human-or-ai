The house was finally quiet, the only light coming from the small lamp over the kitchen sink. She traced the rim of her water glass, replaying the conversations from earlier. It wasn't the questions themselves that were tiring, but their predictable sequence. There seems to be a silent, universally distributed script for how these things are meant to unfold. You meet, you date, you clear a series of escalating hurdles—meeting friends, then parents—all leading toward a public declaration. Each step is treated like a formal milestone, a box to be checked on some invisible timeline that everyone else seems to hold. It transforms the deeply personal search for connection into something of a spectator sport, where your progress is constantly being gauged by an audience. You’re not just building a relationship; you’re performing one for approval.
