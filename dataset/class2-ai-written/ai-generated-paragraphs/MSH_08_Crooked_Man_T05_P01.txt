For years, we’ve all gathered in this house, admiring the pristine white walls and the polished family portraits that line them, celebrating a version of ourselves that never truly existed.

This perfect scene, this curated display of familial harmony, is the most elaborate lie we’ve ever agreed to tell. It’s a beautiful frame, but the picture inside has been missing for a very long time, and I think we all know it.
