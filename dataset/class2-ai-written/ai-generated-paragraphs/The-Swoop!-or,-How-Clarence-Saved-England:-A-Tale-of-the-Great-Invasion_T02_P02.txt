You can keep shaking your head, but you're not the one who notices. You don't see how the bread from the corner bakery suddenly has a slightly different crust, or how the stray cat on our block has just vanished. Vanished! It’s all connected. They start with the tiny, comforting details of your life, subtly altering them to create a baseline of unease, a creeping anxiety you can't quite place. Then, when the real changes begin, you’re already too disoriented to fight back. It isn't about troops on the horizon; it’s about this. It's the quiet replacement of the familiar. Mark my words, one morning we’ll wake up and the sky will be a different shade of blue, and you’ll still be telling me it’s just the weather. You have to start looking closer.
