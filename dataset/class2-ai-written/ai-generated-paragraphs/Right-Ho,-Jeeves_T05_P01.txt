Under the excessively grand chandelier, my date, an earnest architect named Ben, is now locked in animated conversation with Maya. This would be fine, even pleasant, except for the fact that Maya is the person whose apartment I left at five this morning with a vague promise to call. They’re laughing, and my stomach plummets. Ben has no idea who she is, and Maya certainly doesn’t know I’m not here alone. I am paralyzed by the sheer mathematical impossibility of a good outcome. My choices seem to be: A) stride over with a smile frozen to my face and introduce them, an act of pure social self-immolation; B) retreat to the restroom and hope the problem magically dissolves; or C) feign a sudden, debilitating allergy to the canapés. Right now, pretending I’m about to have an anaphylactic reaction to a mini quiche feels like the most dignified escape route available.
