Sitting here, watching the chaotic choreography of the market square, I’m reminded of that strange meeting. The experts sat around the table, their confidence a well-honed shield built from decades of shared assumptions and proven methods. They saw the problem through a single, highly polished lens. Then, the newcomer, armed with nothing but naive questions and a complete ignorance of their established protocols, proposed a solution so simple it was almost insulting. The silence that followed wasn't one of confusion, but of a dawning, collective realization. It was the sound of a carefully constructed reality being dismantled by a pebble of unburdened thought. They had built a fortress of knowledge, forgetting that the most elegant key is often the one you would never think to look for, precisely because you already know too much. Their expertise had become their cage.
