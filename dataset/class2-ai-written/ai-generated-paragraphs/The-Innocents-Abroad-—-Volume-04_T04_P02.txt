No, don't give me that look. You know exactly what I’m talking about. We all came here for a fresh start, a clean slate, but the ones who laid the first stones are already acting like petty kings. I saw them last night, arguing in hushed, angry voices over who gets the riverside plot. The *riverside plot*. Meanwhile, Sarah's kid is sick and we’re being told to conserve medical supplies. They preach about unity and divine purpose from that rickety podium they built, but I’ve seen them trading favors and hoarding the best rations for themselves. This grand project, this supposed haven they sold us on? It's just the same old world with better marketing. They’re not pioneers building a new society; they’re just the first ones in line at a banquet, making sure they get the best cuts before anyone else sits down.
