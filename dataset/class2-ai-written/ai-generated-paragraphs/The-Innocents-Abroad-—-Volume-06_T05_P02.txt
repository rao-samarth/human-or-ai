Oh, it was a whirlwind, honestly. We did Paris in two days, which was madness, but you have to, don't you? Up at dawn, straight to the Louvre—we ran through the main hall, saw the Mona Lisa from fifty feet away, snapped the required photo, and were out before the crowds hit. Then it was a sprint to the tower, up the elevator, quick look around, back down. We grabbed a croissant on the way to the train station for Brussels, where we had exactly four hours to find the famous statue and eat a waffle. I think Mark got a good picture. The whole time you're just moving, ticking things off the list. We barely sat down, but we saw everything we were supposed to see, and now I have a thousand photos to sort through. Next year, we're thinking seven countries in ten days.
