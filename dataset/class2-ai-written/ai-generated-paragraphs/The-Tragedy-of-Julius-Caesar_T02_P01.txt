A person can stand on a quiet hill, surrounded by the gentle hum of the world, and still feel a profound lack. The drive for more, for what lies just over the next rise, is a strange and demanding master. It promises a grand view from the summit but neglects to mention the cost of the climb, which is often the journey itself. Every step upward becomes a step away from the present moment, from the simple contentment of the valley floor. The wind in the tall grass and the warmth of the sun become mere obstacles, background noise to the singular goal. Soon, the climber forgets the feel of the earth beneath their feet. They only know the ache of ascent and the mirage of the horizon, a destination that recedes with every advance, leaving them perpetually dissatisfied in a landscape that was meant to offer peace.
