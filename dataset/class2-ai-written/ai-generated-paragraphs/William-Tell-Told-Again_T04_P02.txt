You sit there in that great heavy chair, and I see you truly believe it makes you different. You rearrange names on a chart, draw new borders on a map, and speak as if your words alone can bend reality to your will. But what is it, really? A performance for an audience of one. The river doesn't read your proclamations before it floods its banks; the sun doesn't ask your permission to set. You’ve convinced yourself that the symbols of control are the same as control itself, a profound and isolating mistake. You are meticulously curating the architecture of a cage, forgetting all the while that the sky has no walls. And everyone else? We’re just waiting for you to look up.
