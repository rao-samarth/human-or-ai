I know what it looks like from the outside, but you have to understand this place. You don’t just see it; you breathe it in every day. It’s the rust on the chain-link fence at the empty playground, the way old Mr. Gable pretends to window-shop just to stay warm inside the pharmacy for a few minutes. We all see it. We see the kids whose only decent meal is the one from school and the men who used to have pride in their work now staring at their own hands like they’re useless tools. People are just finding different ways to sink slowly. Some use a bottle, some just get quiet and disappear inside themselves. I just picked a faster way to keep my head above water for one more day. I wasn't trying to get ahead; I was just trying not to drown.
