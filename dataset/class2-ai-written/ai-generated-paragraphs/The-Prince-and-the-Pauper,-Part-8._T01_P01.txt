“Look at that man across the aisle,” Elena murmured, nudging my arm as the train rattled through the countryside. “He has his life completely sorted.” I followed her gaze to a figure in a perfectly tailored grey suit, his polished shoes reflecting the overhead lights. He looked like he had just stepped out of a magazine, a portrait of calm success. “I don’t know,” I replied, watching him. “The suit is sharp, sure. But look closer. His tie is ever so slightly crooked, and he keeps twisting the ring on his finger, over and over again. And his phone—he just unlocked it, stared at the blank screen for a full minute, and locked it again. He looks less like a man who has it all and more like a man who’s terrified of what he’s about to walk into.”
