You expect a speech about duty, I imagine. About the bright future I’m meant to secure. The truth is, the path to this podium wasn’t paved with noble intentions, but with a quiet, grinding compromise of every principle I once held. Someone had to make the difficult choices, the ones that leave you hollowed out inside, just to keep the whole fragile structure from collapsing. They told me it was for the best. A steady hand was needed, they said, and mine was the only one not trembling or grasping for more. I believed them. So yes, I stand here, ready to accept the mantle you are about to place on my shoulders. But I need you to understand that the person you are elevating is not a hero. He is merely what was left over after the necessary sacrifices were made.
