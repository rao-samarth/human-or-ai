A man whose suit seemed a size too small, the self-appointed 'Curator of Guest Experience', was intercepting attendees near the hors d'oeuvres. He was gravely informing a woman that she had consumed the shrimp puff before the wild mushroom tartlet, a severe breach of the evening's established 'flavor journey'. His voice, a low and conspiratorial hiss, explained that the earthy notes of the mushroom were essential for priming the palate for the oceanic zest of the shrimp. The woman simply stared, a half-eaten puff frozen mid-air. Just then, a waiter bustled past, cheerfully announcing to his colleague, “They’re loving the shrimp! We’re all out of the mushroom ones, just fyi.” The Curator’s face went through a rapid, fascinating series of contortions, a silent, miniature ballet of crumbling authority.
