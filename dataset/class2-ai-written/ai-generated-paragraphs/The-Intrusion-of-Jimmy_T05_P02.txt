The train rattled through the dark, its rhythm a hollow beat against the silence in the carriage. Outside, the lights of unknown towns were just smudged glows against the glass. A few rows ahead, a man quietly passed a piece of bread to his son, food he’d hidden from the inspectors at the last stop where such things were forbidden. The guard walked by, his eyes lingering for a moment before moving on, a silent pact of feigned ignorance. It was a small crime, a broken rule in a book of many. Yet, in the dim, stale air of the carriage, it felt like the only decent thing to have happened all night. I wondered how many lines we cross that way, guided not by signs or statutes but by a quiet, human murmur that tells us what is truly necessary, leaving the law to look the other way in the dark.
