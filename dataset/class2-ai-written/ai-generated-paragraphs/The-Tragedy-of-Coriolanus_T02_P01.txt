The rocking of the carriage is a familiar, lulling rhythm, but my eyes keep drifting to the next car. Through the smeared glass of the connecting door, I can see the muted lighting, the plush, half-empty seats, and the undisturbed calm of the passengers there. Here, the air is thick with the scent of damp coats and the day's fatigue. Every jolt is shared, a collective shudder passing through bodies packed just a little too close. It’s strange how a few millimeters of reinforced glass can hold back a tide. There isn’t open hostility, not really, just a low-grade hum of resentment you can almost hear beneath the clatter of the wheels. It feels precarious, like all it would take is one wrong glance, one more unexpected delay, to make the pressure unbearable. You can feel it in the quiet—the shared understanding that the barrier is only as strong as the patience on this side of it.
