It’s just the house settling, I keep telling myself. That sharp little crack from the hallway floorboards is nothing more than old wood complaining about the cold. But it’s a specific sound, the same one every time, and it always comes after the clock chimes three. They say nothing good happens at this hour. I think they’re wrong; nothing *happens* at all, except for the re-run of that evening in my head, a film I can’t turn off. I only said what anyone would have said in that situation. It was a perfectly reasonable thing to say. If the outcome was… unexpected, that’s not on me. The house groaned again, louder this time, like a heavy weight shifting in the attic directly overhead. My breath catches in my throat, but I force it out. It’s always nothing. It has to be.
