You want to know what it was. I can see it in your eyes when I walk into the general store. Here, we argue for months about whether a new traffic light is needed at the crossroads, weighing every opinion because every life matters. That’s what we’re taught. But over there, we were given a number on a map, a barren stretch of rock and dust that meant nothing to us, and we were told to take it. We lost good people for that ground, people I played baseball with behind the old school. The next day, we lost the ground itself. The whole enterprise was a transaction of bodies for a piece of earth no one would ever live on, and we were praised for it. You’re asked to forget the rules you grew up with, to trade them for a different kind of madness, and then they send you home and expect you to remember where the stop signs are.
