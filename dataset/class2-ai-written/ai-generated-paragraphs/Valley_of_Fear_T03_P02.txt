"You think I'm an idiot?" My voice was a low hiss, barely audible over the engine's hum. "You think I didn't see the same black car parked on our street again?" I slammed my palm against the dashboard, the plastic groaning in protest. "This isn't a game. This isn't your neat little separate world anymore. It's bleeding. It's seeping through the cracks you swore didn't exist, and now it's on our doorstep. What happens when they stop watching? When they decide to knock? You've dragged me into this, dragged everything we have into the mud right alongside you. You keep saying you have a handle on it, but all I see is the rope slipping through your fingers, faster and faster." He just stared through the windshield, his knuckles white on the steering wheel, a stranger in the driver's seat.
