The great petunia pot conspiracy was solved not with a battering ram, but with simple observation. Mayor Thompson’s prized begonias were gone, and the only clue was a single, muddy footprint next to the empty stand. Everyone suspected teenage pranksters, of course. But the mud wasn't from the park; it was the clay-heavy soil from the riverbank, where only old Mr. Abernathy goes to fish. Furthermore, the print had a distinct waffle pattern, identical to the mail-order orthopedic shoes Abernathy had been complaining about for weeks at the diner. He wasn't a thief, just forgetful. He’d "borrowed" the pot to re-home a stray fern he found, convinced the mayor wouldn't mind. When confronted, he simply blinked, looked at the fern now thriving on his porch, and asked if the mayor wanted it back.
