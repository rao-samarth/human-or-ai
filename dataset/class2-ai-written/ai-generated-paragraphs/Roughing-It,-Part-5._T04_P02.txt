The weekly strategy meeting unfolded with its usual choreographed politeness. Everyone sat around the polished conference table, nodding at the appropriate intervals as slides filled with optimistic projections flickered across the screen. They spoke a carefully curated language of synergy and value-adds, a verbal armor against the rawer impulses simmering just beneath the surface. When one manager gently interjected with a “point of clarification,” it was understood by all as a subtle challenge to another’s domain. A smile might be offered, but it rarely reached the eyes, which were busy calculating, assessing threats, and identifying opportunities for advancement. The entire ritual felt less like a genuine collaboration and more like a gathering of predators who had agreed, for one hour, to use forks and knives. It was a temporary truce, a shared understanding that the hunt for resources and status would resume the moment they all returned to their desks.
