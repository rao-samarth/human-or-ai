I overheard the two women at the next table, their coffee cups forgotten. The younger one was shaking her head in disbelief. “So the city just dropped the charges? After all that? He technically broke the rules.” The older woman smiled, a small, knowing expression. “Rules are just the best guess we have on a good day,” she said, her voice soft but clear. “They're the starting point, not the destination. When a hundred people show up and say one man feeding his neighbors with a patch of unused dirt is more important than a forgotten bylaw, the rules have to listen. It’s not about finding a loophole. It’s about remembering what the rules were for in the first place—to help people flourish, not to punish them for it. That’s when you know things are moving in the right direction.”
