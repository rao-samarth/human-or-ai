You asked how everyone knew to prepare before the weather service even issued a warning. It was Mr. Abernathy, of course. He was out on his porch, just staring at the horizon like he does. He didn't have a computer or a fancy barometer, just his eyes and whatever it is he feels in his bones. He announced to the mailman that the winds would be coming from the east by nightfall and that the river would crest its banks by morning. That was it. Nobody questioned it. Within an hour, you could hear the sound of hammers boarding up windows down on Main Street, and the general store sold out of batteries. When a man has been right about every flood, drought, and blizzard for sixty years, his word simply becomes the weather forecast. It is a different kind of truth out here, one that you can’t argue with.
