Look, everyone wants to hear about the grand strategy, the ten-year plan I supposedly had sketched out on a napkin. The truth? There wasn't one. Not a single page of it. They praise my foresight in that merger, but I was just in the right elevator when their CEO was complaining about his board. I got the promotion because the lead candidate, a man infinitely more qualified, came down with a spectacular case of food poisoning the morning of the final interview. My entire career has been a series of fortunate accidents, of stumbling forward in the dark and tripping over a bag of gold. People look at me and see some kind of visionary, a master strategist moving pieces on a board. I know the reality: I’m the child who accidentally knocked the whole table over and was somehow declared the winner.
