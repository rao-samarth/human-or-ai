The house is silent, except for the soft click of metal on wood as I lay the pieces out on the dining room table. Her favorite table. We bought it on a Sunday, arguing playfully over the dark stain of the wood. My hands don't shake. They move with a purpose I haven't felt since she laughed in this very room, a cold clarity that has sharpened every one of my senses to a razor's edge. The authorities called it a tragedy, a terrible misfortune, and closed the file. But they don't understand. They can't comprehend that a love like ours doesn't just vanish when a heart stops beating. It doesn't fade into grief. It transforms. It crystallizes into a single, unbreakable promise. And tonight, I begin to keep it.
