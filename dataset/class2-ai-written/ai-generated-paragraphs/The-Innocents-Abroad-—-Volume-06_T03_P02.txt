You ask for an explanation as if I’ve committed a crime, as if doubt itself is the real transgression. They always told me it was a gift, this unwavering conviction. But a gift you are forbidden from inspecting, from holding up to the light, starts to feel less like a treasure and more like a beautifully decorated box with unknown contents. I didn't choose to stop believing; I simply chose to start looking. My questions are not an attack. They are proof that I am paying attention. Following a map without ever glancing up at the actual stars seems like the greater blindness to me. So tell me, is it truly a betrayal to want to know if the ground beneath my own feet is solid?
