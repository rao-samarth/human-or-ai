You keep talking about balance, about the delicate order of things, but what you really mean is your comfort. You see the city from your high windows and think you understand it, but you only see patterns, not people. For you, a downturn is an inconvenience, a number in a ledger that needs correcting. For us? It's the cold seeping through the floorboards. It's another night spent listening to a child's empty stomach rumble. You debate theories in warm, well-lit rooms, patting yourselves on the back for your compassion, while we live the brutal consequences of your smallest miscalculations. This isn't a game of strategy for us. There's no resetting the board when a move goes wrong. This is just life, and we're the pieces you so casually sacrifice.
