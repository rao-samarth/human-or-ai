His focus narrowed to a single point of action—get up, check the lock, peer through the blinds. She, however, remained still on the couch, her thoughts drifting outward from the sound like ripples. It wasn't a threat to be neutralized but a sudden, lonely note in the night's symphony. She imagined the old oak letting go of a dead piece of itself, a small, necessary surrender. Her mind didn't jump to locks and doors but to the fragility of things, to the way the house sighed and settled around them, a living creature breathing in the dark. He was already halfway to the window while she was still miles away, lost in the echo.
