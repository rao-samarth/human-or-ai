It used to be about the work. We were just two people against a deadline, sharing lukewarm coffee and complaints about the fluorescent lighting that hummed over our cubicles. Our conversations were a simple currency of project updates and weekend plans, easy and forgettable. But somewhere between the thousandth spreadsheet and the quiet echo of the empty office after everyone else had gone home, the space between our desks began to feel different. I found myself noticing the small things: the way he’d push his glasses up his nose when deep in thought, the specific rhythm of his typing, the tired smile he’d offer me at two in the morning. Now, sitting here alone, the silence feels wrong without his quiet presence. The project is finished, but I realize it was never the point. The point was the shared silence, the knowing glance, the slow, imperceptible slide from colleague to something I don’t have a name for yet, something that makes the thought of tomorrow’s mundane routine without him feel impossibly heavy.
