I wish you could feel the quiet out here. It’s not an empty silence; it’s full of sounds you’ve probably forgotten existed, the ones that get smothered by traffic and deadlines. Remember all those meetings about optimizing and leveraging and scaling? None of that language matters to the hawk circling overhead or the creek carving its slow path through the woods. I spent years building a life that felt like a perfectly tailored, suffocating suit, every seam pulling. Now, my only real schedule is the sun's long arc across the sky, and my biggest decision today was whether to walk north or south. It feels like I've stepped off a speeding train while it was still moving. My ears are still ringing from the noise, but I’m finally starting to hear everything else.
