Aunt Carol’s shriek cut through the party chatter. Her diamond earring was gone. Chaos erupted. People patted their pockets, checked under cushions, a flurry of useless motion. My eyes, however, were still. I scanned the path from the kitchen to the patio where she had been standing just moments before. A wet ring from a spilled drink on the tile. A single, crushed cheese puff near the doorway. And there, by the leg of the garden table, a fresh gouge in the soft wood, too sharp for a shoe. My gaze snapped to my nephew, Kevin, who was now studiously ignoring everyone, furiously texting on his phone. He’d been showing off his new multi-tool just minutes earlier, the one with the sharp metal pick. The earring wasn’t lost. It was snagged. I saw the faint, tell-tale shimmer caught in the hinge of the tool’s clip as he shifted his weight, a tiny star against the dark metal of his belt.
