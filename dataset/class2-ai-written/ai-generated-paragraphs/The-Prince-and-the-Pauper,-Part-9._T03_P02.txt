Don’t you dare stand there and call it weakness. You have no idea. I once thought the same way you do, from the same comfortable height, before the ground dissolved right under my feet. I remember a day, just one, when the calls stopped coming and the silence in my apartment was so loud it felt like an engine had cut out mid-flight. There was nothing left to hold onto. Nothing. It’s a terrifying, hollow space where you learn that strength isn't about never falling; it’s about surviving the impact when you do. What you see as a flaw is just the shape of their crater, the mark left behind by a collision you were lucky enough to avoid. So stop throwing stones into it. You have no idea how deep it really is, or what it took for them to crawl out at all.
