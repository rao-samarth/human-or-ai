The house settled into its late-night silence, but sleep wouldn't come. From down the hall, I heard the faint, rhythmic creak of floorboards in my brother’s room. Pacing. I knew that sound intimately, the sound of a mind circling a problem with no clear exit. A few years ago, when I was the one walking hollowed-out paths in my own bedroom after my world fell apart, his attempts at comfort had felt like hollow echoes. “It’ll get better,” he’d said, his voice full of a bright, unscarred optimism I couldn't stand. But now, listening to his restless steps, I didn't feel annoyance or pity. Instead, a quiet, aching recognition bloomed in my chest. I finally understood the specific weight of his silence, the shape of the fear that kept him moving when all he wanted was to be still. It was a language I had been forced to learn, and now I could hear every word.
