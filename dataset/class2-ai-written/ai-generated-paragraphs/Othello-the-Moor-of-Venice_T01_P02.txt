The only sound is the refrigerator’s low hum, a constant thrum in the dark house. The phone is over there on the nightstand, a silent black rectangle. It’s not that I’m trying to find something, really. I’m not that kind of person. But when a screen gets flipped over with a casualness that isn’t casual at all, it plants a seed. It’s a tiny thing, but my mind won’t let it go, watering it with every late work night and every distracted answer from the past month. All the little pieces start to rearrange themselves, forming a new, ugly picture. It feels like a sickness, this need to know, a slow-burning acid in my stomach. I know that looking would be the end of everything, but not looking… not knowing for sure… feels like a different kind of ending, one that happens slowly from the inside out.
