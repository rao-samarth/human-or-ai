My uncle laid out his case with the precision of a mathematical proof, explaining why selling the old cottage was the only financially sound decision. He had charts. He had projections. Every point was unassailable, a fortress of logic against which my aunt's emotional pleas should have crumbled. Yet, as I watched the faces around the dinner table, I saw his logic fail to connect. His mistake was assuming the argument was about numbers on a page. For everyone else, it was about the memory of summer evenings on the porch and the faint smell of pine in the upstairs bedrooms. He had constructed a flawless argument for an entirely different conversation than the one the family was actually having, and in doing so, he lost before he even began.
