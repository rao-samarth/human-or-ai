The clinking of glasses and low hum of conversation should be comforting, but I find myself watching my great-uncle hold court at the head of the table. It strikes me, not for the first time, what a strange and terrible thing it is to possess another person’s future. It’s not just the one in chains who is diminished. The one who holds the key, who dictates the labor and the waking hours, must surely undergo a slow hollowing. To maintain such a position requires a constant, internal argument that the other is somehow less—less human, less worthy, less real. This daily act of willed blindness, this deliberate deadening of empathy, must eventually rot a person from the inside out. They become a warden of their own soul, and the freedom they deny to another is a freedom they can never truly experience themselves, for their world has shrunk to the size of a cage.
