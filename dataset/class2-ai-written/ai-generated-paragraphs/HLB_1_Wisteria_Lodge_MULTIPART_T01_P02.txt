My uncle raised his glass, a toast to "moving on," and the words hung in the air, thick and cloying like the gravy on the table. Across from me, my mother’s smile was a brittle thing, a pane of glass just waiting for the right vibration to shatter. I saw her hand tighten around my father's, her knuckles stark white against his skin. No one else seemed to notice. The cousins were laughing, the kids were shrieking, but for a moment, the room was silent just for us. It was always like this. The past was never a story they told; it was the empty chair at the table, the tremor in my grandmother’s voice when she spoke of her village, the reason my mother still flinched at loud, sudden noises. They had built this life, this perfect suburban picture, on a foundation of unspoken horrors, and every so often, a single careless word was enough to feel the whole structure tremble.
