It was the strangest thing in our team meeting today. Kevin, one of the junior sales guys, pitched this genuinely brilliant idea for the new marketing campaign. He had it all mapped out, super clear and logical. You could see people nodding, but then the director just sort of brushed past it. Not ten minutes later, the director clears his throat and says he has a “thought,” then proceeds to repeat Kevin’s idea almost verbatim, just with more jargon. And suddenly? It’s revolutionary. People are scrambling to write it down, calling it a game-changer. Kevin just sat there staring at his hands. It’s so bizarre; the idea itself didn’t change, only the status of the person who said it. We’re all just acting out parts in some weird play where the script matters less than who gets to speak the lines.
