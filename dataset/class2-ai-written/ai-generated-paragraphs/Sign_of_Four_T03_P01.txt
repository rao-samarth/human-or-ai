The connection to the regional office is lagging again. On screen, my colleague’s voice keeps cutting out, a digital ghost speaking from a place my manager only sees as a red dot on our global expansion map. He sighs, tapping his pen on the polished boardroom table, and talks about "infrastructure challenges" as if it’s some abstract business problem, a line item on a spreadsheet. He doesn’t see the history behind that lag, does he? He doesn’t see the ghost of old trade routes, the ones that were designed to pull everything valuable out and put so little back in. We’re still using those same pathways, just with fiber optic cables instead of ships. Now he wants to "streamline the data pipeline," and I wonder if he's ever really thought about what that pipeline has carried, and in which direction, for centuries.
