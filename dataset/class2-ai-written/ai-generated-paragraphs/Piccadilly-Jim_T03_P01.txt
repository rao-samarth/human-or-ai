In a city of ten million stories, it's easy to believe your own history is a final verdict. The past is a concrete weight you drag along crowded pavements, its scraping sound lost in the symphony of sirens and strangers' conversations. But then, sometimes, you meet a gaze across a rain-slicked street or feel a hand find yours in the crush of a subway car. This is not an act of absolution. It is something quieter, more profound: the simple, shocking recognition from another human that they see the person you are now, standing right here, and not just the long, dark shadow of who you used to be. Suddenly, the weight doesn't disappear, but it becomes possible to build with it. You can use those same heavy stones to lay the foundation for a different kind of life, even here, surrounded by the ghosts of what was.
