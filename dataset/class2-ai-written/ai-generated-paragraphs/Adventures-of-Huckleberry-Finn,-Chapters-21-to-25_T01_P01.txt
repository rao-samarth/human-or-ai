The applause in the community hall was genuine, almost fervent. A charismatic consultant from the city had just finished his presentation, complete with glossy renderings of a sprawling technology park where the old cannery now stood. You could see it ripple through the tables: a shared, unspoken agreement to believe. No one questioned the astronomical budget or the ambitious timeline; that kind of practical skepticism could wait for the morning. Instead, they talked of the new jobs, of their children staying instead of leaving for better prospects. They saw a future gleaming back at them from the projection screen, and for tonight, at least, it felt entirely within reach. It was the kind of infectious hope that could only blossom in a place where people still trusted a good story.
