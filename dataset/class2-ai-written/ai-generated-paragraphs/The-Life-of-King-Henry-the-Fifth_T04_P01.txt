It’s strange, watching people from a distance like this. You start inventing lives for them. That man in the crisp suit, staring intensely at his phone, is probably a ruthless executive closing a huge deal. Or maybe he’s just getting frantic updates from the babysitter about a sick kid. The young woman with the sharp haircut and dark lipstick might be a poet who writes about heartbreak, but she could just as easily be a pediatric nurse on her way to a night shift. We all construct these intricate shells for ourselves, carefully assembled from clothes and posture and expressions. It’s a silent agreement: you accept my performance, and I’ll accept yours. Yet beneath it all, there’s this vast, unreadable history we carry around, completely invisible to the person sitting right across the aisle.
