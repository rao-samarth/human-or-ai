It was the *idea* of it.” He gestured with a plastic stirrer, his friend opposite him listening in silence. “The guy in the videos made it sound so simple, so inevitable. A few clicks, a bit of faith, and you’d be free.” He let out a short, hollow laugh. “So I put it all in. Savings, the emergency fund, even that loan I shouldn’t have touched. I kept waiting for the big turn, the moment it all paid off. But the line on the graph just went down, and then it flatlined.” He stared into his lukewarm coffee, the reflection of the fluorescent lights warping on its surface. “Now I’m just trying to figure out how to tell my landlord I’ll be late again.”
