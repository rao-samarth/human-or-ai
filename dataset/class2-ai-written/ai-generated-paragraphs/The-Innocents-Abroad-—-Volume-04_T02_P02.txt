You know, it’s late, and I was just sitting here thinking about those grand old stories we were raised on. They present it all as this seamless, sacred progression, a single golden thread leading directly to us. But the more I think about it, the more I see the stitching. I see the parts that were cut out and the inconvenient figures who were written into the margins or erased completely. It’s not a river flowing from a divine source; it’s a canal, dug by men with a clear destination in mind, its banks carefully reinforced to keep the water from wandering. They polished every stone in that foundation until it shone like a miracle, but when you get close, you can still see the chisel marks. I just can't shake the feeling that what we were taught to revere as unimpeachable truth is actually a brilliant, centuries-old piece of marketing.
