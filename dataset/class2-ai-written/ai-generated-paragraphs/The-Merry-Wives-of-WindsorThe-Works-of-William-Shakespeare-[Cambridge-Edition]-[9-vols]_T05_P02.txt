You have to understand, there wasn't a formal decision. No one stood on a box in the town square; no vote was ever cast. The unease had simply been growing for months, like a low fever you can’t quite shake. Locks were being checked twice, and conversations in the general store would stop when certain cars drove by. After the night of the old mill fire, something shifted. It happened quietly, in nods between neighbors at the post office and shared looks over garden fences. We simply decided we’d had enough. We handled it ourselves, because we knew no one else was coming to fix what was broken. It was never about vengeance. It was about drawing a line in the dirt and remembering what it felt like to sleep with your windows open on a summer night. The quiet you hear now? We earned that quiet back, together.
