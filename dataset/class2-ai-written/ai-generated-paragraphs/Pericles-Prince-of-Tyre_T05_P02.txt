Look, I know you think I ruined your life by spilling that iced americano, but you have to see the bigger picture. If you hadn't slipped, you never would have hit your head, and the paramedic who checked you for a concussion wouldn't have mentioned her brother is the hiring manager at the *other* company you wanted to apply to. And the dry cleaner! When you ran in there, panicking, you helped him catch his runaway poodle. You can’t make this stuff up. That man, the one whose dog you saved, sits on the review board for the downtown business grant you applied for last month. So don't glare at me like that. This wasn't chaos; it was a meticulously planned career move, delivered with a splash of cold brew and a very helpful canine. The universe just has a strange way of handling its paperwork.
