The quarterly board meeting was a strange performance. Today, Mrs. Gable, whose family name adorned the building, expressed grave concern over the emotional well-being of the prize-winning orchids in the lobby. She felt their slight drooping was a reflection of the organization’s spiritual imbalance and proposed hiring a floral therapist. The CEO, who had just spent an hour outlining devastating budget cuts to our outreach programs, nodded with a practiced, solemn expression. He promised to form a subcommittee to explore horticultural wellness solutions. I watched the two of them from the back of the room, a silent observer in a world where the perceived feelings of plants were deemed more urgent than the people we were meant to serve. A profound sense of weariness settled over me, heavier than the polished silence in the mahogany-paneled room.
