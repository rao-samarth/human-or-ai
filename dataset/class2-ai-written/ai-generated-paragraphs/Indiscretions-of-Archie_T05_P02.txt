I know your mother called again, and I know the contractor is coming back tomorrow, but I really need you to just look at me for a second. It feels like we’re just two stressed-out roommates managing a series of disasters. We haven't had a real conversation in a week. Not about which bills are due or whose turn it is to deal with the landlord. I mean *us*. This was supposed to be our beginning, remember? Our little island. Instead, it feels like we’re drowning in everyone else's emergencies and expectations. I just... I miss you. Can we please put down the phones and the to-do lists for ten minutes and just find each other in this mess?
