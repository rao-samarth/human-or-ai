“You think I don’t know, don’t you?” My voice was low, but it cut through the sterile hum of the after-hours office. He just kept polishing his glasses, a perfect picture of calm concern. “Know what? You’ve been under a lot of pressure lately.” The condescension was a new touch. “The ‘corrupted’ project files. The ‘accidental’ email deletions. It’s funny how the glitches always happened right after one of our little chats, right after you’d pat me on the back and tell me I was doing great work.” A short, bitter laugh escaped me. “It was a perfect performance. All that mentorship, the friendly coffee runs, the ‘we’re a team’ speeches—it was all just a beautifully constructed lie.” He finally stopped polishing, his knuckles white around the tiny cloth, the smile not quite reaching his eyes anymore. I saw it then. You weren't building me up; you were just finding the weakest point in my foundation before you kicked it out.
