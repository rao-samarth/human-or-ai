I'm sitting on a bench near the playground, and I just watched a father make his son drop a stick. To the dad, who was busy on his phone, it was just a grimy piece of wood, a potential for splinters or a poked eye. But for that little kid, you could see it was everything. It was a sword, a magic wand, the mast of a pirate ship sailing across the wood chips. I remember that feeling so clearly, how a patch of weeds could be a dangerous jungle and a puddle could be a treacherous ocean. Your entire world operated on a different set of laws, laws of imagination. Then a grown-up steps in with their sensible, boring rules about cleanliness and being on time, and the whole universe just deflates. The magic evaporates, and all you're left with is a dirty stick.
