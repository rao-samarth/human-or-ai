My friends keep saying I only see what I want to see, and maybe they’re right. I sit here on this bench, watching thousands of people hurry past with their own urgent destinations, and I’ve never felt more invisible. They’re all just a blur of determined faces, a river of noise and purpose that I’m not a part of. But then my phone buzzes, and a simple message from you makes the entire city snap into sharp focus. Suddenly, the streetlights feel warmer, the distant sirens sound like a symphony. It's a dangerous feeling, I know, relying on one person to make the world feel solid, but the thought of fading back into this anonymous crowd is so much worse.
