You see, the sugar packets used to be blue. I know they were. Every morning for a year, I’d come to this café, get the same dark roast, and use two of those crisp blue packets. Now they’re brown, and the barista, the one with the kind eyes, she insists they’ve always been brown. She even looked at me funny when I asked. But I have such a clear picture in my head: the white ceramic mug, the steam curling up, my thumb tearing the corner of a little blue rectangle. It’s not a small thing, don’t you understand? If something that solid, that real, can just change overnight without anyone else noticing or admitting it, what else has shifted? It’s like the whole world quietly decided to edit a page when I wasn't looking, and I'm the only one who still remembers the original draft.
