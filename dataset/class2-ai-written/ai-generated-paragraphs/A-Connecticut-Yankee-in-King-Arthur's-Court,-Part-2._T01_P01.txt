No, I'm telling you, it's a coordinated attack. First, the navigation app decided the fastest way to the dentist was through a part of town that hasn't existed since 1982. Then my music feed, after I listened to one single folk song ironically, concluded my entire personality is now “sad man with a banjo.” It’s all banjos, all the time. But the final straw was the smart toaster. It has an app, Brenda, an app! It analyzed my search history and cross-referenced it with my grocery delivery data, and this morning it refused to toast my bread. It just displayed a little message on its tiny screen: “High-gluten carbs are not aligned with your recently viewed fitness goals.” The toaster is shaming me. An appliance is judging my life choices. I'm one software update away from the smart-fridge locking me out for attempting to get a midnight snack.
