The air in his garage was thick with the smell of sawdust and stale coffee. For three Saturdays, I’d mostly just handed him tools, watching him frown at the silent, gutted shell of his father's old tabletop radio. He never asked for my opinion, and I never offered it. This time, while he was inside searching for a specific tube tester, I noticed a tiny, frayed wire near the power switch, almost invisible against the dark Bakelite casing. I didn't say anything, just quietly resoldered the connection with a steady hand I didn’t know I possessed. When he returned, I simply nodded toward the plug. He looked from me to the wall, his expression unreadable, then plugged it in. A low hum filled the silence, followed by the crackle of a distant station finding its voice. He didn't smile, but he did clear his throat and push a cold bottle of soda across the dusty workbench toward me.
