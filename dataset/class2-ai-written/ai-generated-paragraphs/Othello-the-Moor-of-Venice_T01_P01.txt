The creek murmured beside them as they walked the familiar dirt path. "He even tried to make that lemon cake you love, remember?" Maya said, a genuine smile in her voice. "It was a complete disaster, but a very sweet one." Her sister, Chloe, offered a tight-lipped nod. "It must be so simple for you." The words were quiet, almost lost in the rustle of leaves. Maya stopped. "Simple? I don't think—" But Chloe cut her off, not looking at her. "No, I mean it. Everything just... works out. You meet the right person, you get the right job. It's like you're walking down a path someone else cleared for you." She kicked a loose stone, sending it skittering across the water's surface, breaking the calm. The silence that followed was suddenly heavy, the sound of the creek no longer comforting but just empty noise between them.
