I’ve lived in this town my whole life, and I’ve learned that you can’t trust the scenery. We have these perfect-looking streets, you know? Lawns cut to exactly the same height, fresh coats of paint on every shutter, and flowers blooming in every window box. Tourists drive through and probably think it’s some kind of utopia pulled straight from a postcard. But if you sit in the corner booth at the diner long enough, you hear the real story. You learn that the immaculate house on Elm Street is a battleground of silent resentment, and the cheerful couple who wave at everyone from their porch are drowning in debt. It’s all a carefully constructed stage. The real life of this place happens in the whispers, the missed glances, and the cracks in the pavement that everyone pretends not to see.
