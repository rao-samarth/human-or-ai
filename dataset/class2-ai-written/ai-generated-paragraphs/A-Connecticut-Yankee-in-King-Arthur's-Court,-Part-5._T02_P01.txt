The old manor on the hill casts a long shadow, an inherited fact of life like the slow bend of the river that borders the town. The family’s name is etched into the stone of the library and the iron of the bridge, a constant, quiet reminder of who holds the land. People here don't actively resent them; it’s more a form of weary acceptance. But the imbalance is clear in the small, everyday details. You see the heir, a perfectly ordinary young man of no special talent, making decisions about crop yields and tenancy with an unearned authority. Meanwhile, the stonemason’s daughter, whose hands are more skilled and mind is sharper than his will ever be, can only hope to be hired to repair his crumbling garden walls. Her proven ability is simply a service for sale, while his accidental birth grants him dominion over the very ground she walks on.
