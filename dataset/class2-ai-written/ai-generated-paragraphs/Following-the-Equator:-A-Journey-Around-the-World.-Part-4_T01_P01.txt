Kevin from Marketing has officially established a new territory in the design corner. He just rolled his chair over one morning, brought a sad-looking ficus, and unilaterally declared our quiet workspace the “Synergy Stronghold.” Our old system, which mostly involved being left alone to actually design things, has been completely dismantled. The mood board, full of color palettes and concept art, was replaced by his whiteboard of impenetrable sales funnels. He calls it “liberating our creative potential by integrating cross-departmental paradigms,” but this mostly involves him using a hideously loud mechanical keyboard and borrowing all the good pens. He assures us this new arrangement is for the betterment of the entire company, a bold mission of progress to break down silos. His ficus is already dying, dropping brown leaves onto our sketches.
