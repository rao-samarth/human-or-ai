You keep asking me to forget, to build something new on top of the old foundations. But you don't understand what those foundations are made of. They aren't just stone; they're bone. Every time I try to lay a new brick, I hear a crack beneath me, the sound of what came before refusing to be buried. You see a quiet field, a place to start over. I see the disturbed earth where things were left. We can paint the walls and plant a garden, but the ghosts will still wander the halls. They don't scream or rattle chains. They just stand there, in the quiet moments, reminding me that this house was never truly ours to begin with. It belongs to them. It always has.
