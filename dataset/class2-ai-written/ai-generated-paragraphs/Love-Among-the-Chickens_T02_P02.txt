My cousin’s laughter is like a fire alarm, but all I can see is him across the patio. Of course, my Aunt Susan has cornered him by the drinks table, probably recounting the entire plot of that new crime show she likes. Most people would see that as a dead end, a polite barrier. I see it as the final level of a game. It’s a test, really. He looked over a second ago—I know he did—and it wasn’t just a random glance. It was a signal, a little flare sent up over the battlefield of small talk. He’s waiting for a rescue. All I have to do is navigate past Uncle Dave’s grilling monologue and Susan’s dramatic reenactments. They say the best things in life are worth fighting for. And this, wading through a sea of relatives to save him from a conversation about begonias, feels like the most important fight of all.
