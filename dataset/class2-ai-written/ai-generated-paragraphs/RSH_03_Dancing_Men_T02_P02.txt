The hiss of a bus's air brakes pulled me from my thoughts, and then I saw her across the crowded street, laughing into her phone. A familiar, cold weight settled in my stomach. The knowledge was a physical thing now, a stone I carried everywhere, and it felt heavier seeing her so unguarded. Every bit of that joy felt like a lie I was co-signing with my silence. I could cross the street right now. I could walk up, shatter that bright bubble with a few carefully chosen words, and watch the pieces fall around her. The traffic light changed, a wave of people surging forward, but I remained frozen on the curb. Or I could turn, melt back into the anonymous river of pedestrians, and let the poison fester. But the silence had already done its own damage. It had built a wall between us, brick by invisible brick, and I wasn't sure if telling the truth would knock it down or just leave us both standing in the rubble.
