Another Tuesday, another symphony of car horns and the distinct aroma of hot garbage baking on the pavement. The city really knew how to set a mood. We were crammed onto a bus that smelled like wet wool and despair, lurching through traffic that had given up all hope of movement. He was staring out the window, a small, infuriatingly calm smile on his face as if the gridlock was a meditative experience. I was mentally composing a list of all the reasons leaving my apartment was a tactical error. Just as I was about to reach peak misanthropy, a sudden stop sent a briefcase full of something heavy into my knee. He turned, not with sympathy, but with a perfectly raised eyebrow and whispered, ‘And they say chivalry is dead.’ It was a stupid, pointless comment in a stupid, pointless situation. But I found myself smiling back, which was probably the most alarming thing to happen all day.
