Uncle Richard was holding court again, his voice rising above the clinking of ice in glasses as he detailed his latest stock market triumph. He leaned against the mantelpiece, a king in his temporary, suburban castle. Just then, his niece slid her watch off her wrist, the cheap metal catching the lamplight. She murmured a quiet, rehearsed story about a limited-edition piece, a lucky find she couldn't afford to keep. A familiar, hungry glint appeared in Richard’s eyes; he barely glanced at the flimsy clasp or the mass-produced face. The story was just good enough, and the imagined profit margin was too tempting to question. He saw a quick flip, another story to tell. He pulled a thick fold of cash from his wallet, pressing it into her hand while the rest of the family’s conversation hummed on, oblivious. She gave a small, thankful smile as he pocketed his prize, a five-dollar trinket he was certain was his next big win.
