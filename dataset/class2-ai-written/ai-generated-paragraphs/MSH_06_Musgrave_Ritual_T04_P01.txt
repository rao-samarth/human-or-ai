He gestured with a polished walking stick toward the wilting blooms. “We'll have to burn the lot, I suppose.” The woman kneeling by the flowerbed didn’t look up. “It’s not a blight, sir,” she said softly, her fingers working soil from a stubborn root. “It’s a mineral deficiency. See the yellowing pattern on the leaves? It starts from the inside out. If we just treated the soil with chelated iron, they would recover within a few weeks.” He chuckled, a dry, dismissive sound. “A gardener’s theory. Very clever, but I think we'll stick with what we know. Have them cleared by morning.” She just nodded, her knuckles white around the thistle in her hand.
