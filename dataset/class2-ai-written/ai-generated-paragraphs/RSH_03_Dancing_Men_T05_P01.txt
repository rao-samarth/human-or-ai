No, seriously, you should have seen this guy. We’re at that garage over on Maple, and he comes out of the bay wiping his hands on a rag, all puffed up and serious. He starts throwing around all this technical jargon, telling me the entire transmission manifold is cracked and it's going to be a massive, four-figure job. He was trying so hard to be intimidating, you know? Just banking on me being clueless. But I’d had a weird feeling, so I’d done some research while I was waiting. I just calmly pulled up the service bulletin for my car’s make and year. I asked him, "Is it possible it's just this faulty fifty-dollar solenoid? It's a known issue that mimics total failure." The way he deflated was almost funny. All that aggressive confidence just vanished, replaced by this mumbled apology. He knew I'd caught him.
