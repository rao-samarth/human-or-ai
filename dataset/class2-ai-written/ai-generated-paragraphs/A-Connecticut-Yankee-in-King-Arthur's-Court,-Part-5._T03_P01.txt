It’s easy to get discouraged, I know. You look at the grand buildings, the ceremonies focused more on power and wealth than anything else, and you think the original spark has been completely smothered by human ambition. It feels like the entire point was lost centuries ago, buried under layers of politics and procedure. But then I see things that remind me the foundation is still there, just not in those places. I see it when strangers organize a food drive for a struggling family, no organization required. I feel it in the quiet sincerity of a small group singing in a park, their voices creating something beautiful for no other reason than the joy of it. The message never truly lived in the stone and gold anyway; it lives in those small, genuine acts of human connection. That spirit can’t be owned or corrupted, and it’s why I still believe things can be better.
