My uncle sat by the window, swirling the last of his wine, oblivious to the murmur of family conversation around him. I remember him twenty years younger, his voice a booming certainty at this same table, sketching out utopias on napkins and promising a world scrubbed clean of its old sins. He and his friends truly believed they could build a better system, that their conviction was enough to reshape history. They were so sure. Now, his certainty is gone, replaced by this hollowed-out quiet. The friends who shared his vision are gone, too, not through faded friendships but in unmarked fields and forgotten cells. He got the revolution he wanted, or a version of it, but the new order just brought new sorrows, new names to mourn. He never speaks of it, but you can see the cost etched into the lines around his eyes, a quiet ruin left behind by a beautiful, terrible dream.
