No, listen, I told you it was handled. He was about to sign the wrong documents—the *wrong ones*, with the decimal point two places off. I saw them on his desk just as he was walking into the boardroom, so I did the only thing I could think of. I ‘accidentally’ spilled an entire hot latte all over the contracts. Ruined them completely. Of course, he was furious, absolutely livid, shouting about my clumsiness in front of everyone. But while he was distracted by the mess and berating me, I swapped the ruined folder for the correct one I had stashed in my bag. He just called. The deal went through perfectly. He thinks I’m an incompetent fool who cost him a dry-cleaning bill, but he also thinks he's a genius for catching the 'typo' at the last minute. He’ll never know. Better that way, honestly. He gets the glory, and the company doesn't lose a fortune.
