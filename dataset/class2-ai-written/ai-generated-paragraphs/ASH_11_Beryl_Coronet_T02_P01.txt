The man across the packed subway car was definitely up to no good. I was sure of it. He was hunched over a bulky duffel bag, his knuckles white, a sheen of sweat on his brow despite the aggressive air conditioning. Every time the car lurched, he’d clutch it tighter, muttering under his breath and scanning the faces around him with paranoid, darting eyes. My mind raced through the possibilities. Stolen electronics? A bag full of cash? I started subtly planning my heroic intervention, positioning myself for a well-timed leg sweep should he make a run for it at the next stop. Then, a sudden jolt sent a commuter stumbling into him. The bag tipped, unzipped, and out slid a magnificent, five-tiered princess cake, complete with pink frosting and a now-decapitated marzipan unicorn. He just stared at the sugary wreckage on the grimy floor, his shoulders slumping in utter defeat.
