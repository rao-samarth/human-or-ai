It's two in the morning, and the only light in the house is the blue glow of my laptop screen painting my face. I've just found a job posting for a "Director of First Impressions." At first, I thought it was for a receptionist, but the description demands five years of experience in "proactive welcoming" and a "proven track record of positive atmospheric generation." I'm genuinely trying to figure out how to frame my years of greeting my mailman as relevant experience. Maybe I can spin my ability to nod pleasantly at neighbors into a key performance indicator. I'm half-convinced these job titles are generated by an AI that just finished a particularly bad self-help book. Should I mention my award-winning smile from the third-grade yearbook? It feels just as relevant as my degree in history at this point. I think I'll just close the laptop. The mailman can wait.
