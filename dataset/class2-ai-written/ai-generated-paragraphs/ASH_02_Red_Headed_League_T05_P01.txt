The rattling of the train car was a frantic drumbeat to the gambler’s oily smile across the table. He'd been winning all night, his victories built on winks, distracting stories, and hands that moved just a little too fast for the eye to truly follow. I felt the familiar hot flush of being played for a fool, my dwindling pile of coins a monument to his cheap tricks. But then, a stillness settled over me. I stopped trying to catch his deceptions. Instead, I started watching the patterns: the subtle shift in his weight before a bluff, the way his eyes flickered to the discard pile not for information, but to gauge my reaction. It wasn't about the cards he was hiding; it was about the simple, predictable machine of his own greed. And in that final hand, when he laid down his supposed masterpiece with a flourish, I simply laid down my own. The quiet, mathematical certainty of it silenced the entire car. His smile didn't just fade; it shattered.
