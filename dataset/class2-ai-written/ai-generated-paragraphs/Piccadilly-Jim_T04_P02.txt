We thought the details were what mattered. We rented the exact model of rowboat from that grainy photograph, the one where they’re laughing. I spent a week tracking down a vintage picnic basket and the right kind of checkered blanket. The idea was to recreate their first date, to ambush them with a perfect memory they couldn’t possibly argue with. But memories aren't stable things, are they? She remembered it raining that day. He insisted it was sunny. Then they started debating the kind of sandwiches they had, and suddenly it wasn't about the memory anymore. The swan was supposed to be the romantic final touch. It just paddled over, hissed at my father, and stole the entire baguette before capsizing a little toy sailboat some kid had left nearby. They didn't even notice. They just got up and left in separate directions. I was just left there on the dock with an empty basket.
