The cracked vinyl of the diner booth felt cold, even through her thin sweater. He finally broke the silence, his voice low. “I thought I was protecting you.” She let out a short, bitter sound that wasn't a laugh at all. “Protecting me? Or yourself?” He wouldn’t meet her eyes, instead focusing on shredding a paper sugar packet into a tiny, sad pile on the table. “You watched me build my entire life on a foundation of sand. For years. You sat at my table, you celebrated with me, and you knew. All that time, I thought I had someone who had my back. But the silence… it was just another kind of poison, wasn't it? It rotted everything from the inside out, and we never even saw it until the whole thing collapsed.”
