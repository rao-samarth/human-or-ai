There is a peculiar violence in reducing a person to an instrument. Here, in the quiet hum of fluorescent lights, the self is partitioned. Hours are sliced from a life and placed onto a ledger; creativity is measured in deliverables, empathy in client retention statistics. The whole human is not required. In fact, the whole human is a liability—with its messy needs, its unpredictable sorrows, its inconvenient aspirations for meaning beyond the fiscal quarter. What is valued is the function, the exploitable skill, the predictable output of a biological machine whose maintenance is a calculated cost. The body is present, its labor accounted for, but the spirit is treated as an externality, a rounding error in the cold arithmetic of productivity. It is a slow and silent dismantling of a person into a resource.
