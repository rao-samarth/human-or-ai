He’s just sitting there, waiting for me to say the words. The policy is clear, written in stark black and white in the manual on my shelf. Section Four, Subsection B: any violation results in immediate dismissal. No exceptions. I helped write that rule, believing its rigidness would create fairness, removing the messy element of human bias from the equation. But now I'm looking at the human element right across from me. I see the exhaustion in his eyes as he recounts the story of his sick child, a single moment of desperate, stupid judgment that the code could never anticipate. The paper demands one specific outcome. The man in front of me, however, complicates everything. Am I supposed to be a guardian of the code we created, or a guardian of our people? The prescribed words are on the tip of my tongue, but they don't feel right at all.
