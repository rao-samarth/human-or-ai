The Headmaster was talking about character, his voice a low hum under the clinking of cutlery. I glanced over at Jamison, two tables away, looking straight ahead as if he were carved from wood. His parents were beaming, of course. Their son, about to be commended for 'community spirit.' What they didn't know, what none of these adults knew, was that Jamison’s 'community spirit' was simply not telling them it was Michael who'd hotwired the groundskeeper's cart and driven it into the pond. Michael couldn't afford another suspension; his scholarship was on the line. So Jamison, whose record was clean, just took it. He said he tripped. A magnificent, unbelievable lie. It wasn't about friendship—they barely spoke. It was the principle of it. A silent, shared understanding that their world operated on a different set of laws, ones where loyalty to the system, to the group, trumped whatever nonsense was being etched onto a silver cup. He didn't even flinch when his name was called.
