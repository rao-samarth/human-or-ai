The only sound is the refrigerator’s low hum. It’s funny how a simple noise like that can feel like such a luxury, how it can pull you back to a time when every strange clank from an old appliance felt like a countdown to disaster. I can still feel the pit in my stomach from those days, the constant, grinding worry that things would never get better. But they did, at least for now. And sitting here in the quiet, I get this feeling that it's all just a long, slow tide. You get dragged out by the current, struggling to keep your head up, and then eventually, you're washed back onto some peaceful shore. It isn't permanent, of course. No shore is. But you learn to appreciate the calm while you have it, knowing the water will eventually rise again.
