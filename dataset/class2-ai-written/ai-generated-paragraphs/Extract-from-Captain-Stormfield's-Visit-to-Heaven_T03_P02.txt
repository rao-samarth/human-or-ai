Mayor Albright stood beaming beside the newly dedicated town square fountain, his name gleaming on a polished brass plaque that caught the afternoon sun. The local paper took his picture, and the crowd offered polite, dutiful applause for his speech about community spirit and forward-thinking leadership. No one paid much attention to the old man, Elias, who had leaned his bicycle against a far-off oak tree to watch. It was Elias who had spent three months painstakingly setting the heavy stones for the fountain's foundation, ensuring the intricate plumbing would endure freezing winters and the base would never crack. He understood the secrets of the mortar and the unique grain of each slab. Decades from now, when the mayor’s plaque was tarnished and his name a half-forgotten local fact, children would still dip their hands into the cool, clear water, feeling the solid, anonymous stonework beneath their fingers. The work itself would remain.
