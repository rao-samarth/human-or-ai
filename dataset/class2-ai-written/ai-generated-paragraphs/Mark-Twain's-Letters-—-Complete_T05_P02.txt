The house is so quiet tonight, just the low hum from the kitchen that could almost be the engine of a night bus somewhere far away. I used to think that seeing the world would show me all the ways people are different. And they are, of course—in the languages they speak, the food they crave, the gods they pray to. But the more I saw, the more the background noise of those differences faded. What remains is the universal stuff. I saw the same look of parental pride on a father's face in a dusty village in Peru as I did on my own neighbor last week. The same tired slump of a worker's shoulders at the end of a long day in both Tokyo and Toronto. You go out searching for the exotic and what you find, again and again, is the familiar rhythm of human life. It’s comforting, really. It makes the world feel less like a map of foreign countries and more like a single, sprawling neighborhood.
