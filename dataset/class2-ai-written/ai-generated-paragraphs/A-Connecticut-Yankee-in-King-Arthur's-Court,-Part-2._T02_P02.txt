You ask me why I went to the grove, why I ignored the warnings that have kept this valley quiet for centuries. It was not simple defiance. My family has always been the keeper of these rules, the wardens of both the land and its stories. We were taught that our authority was bound to these traditions, these necessary fears of what lurked beyond the stone walls. The whispers of a blight in the soil or a bad moon’s influence were useful tools, ensuring deference from those who worked the fields. They kept everyone in their place. But I began to see the rot wasn't in the earth. It was in the very structure of things, a sickness of belief we nurtured to protect our own position. I went there to prove the shadows were empty, and I found they were. The only monster was the one we invented to keep everyone else afraid.
