Aunt Carol cornered him by the dessert table, her smile a brittle thing. "It's good you came, Tom. Your mother wouldn't have." He picked up a plastic fork, feigning interest in the wilting cheesecake. "She had other plans," he mumbled. "Plans? Or just pride?" Carol’s voice dropped, a familiar, sharp edge to it. "That house was meant for all of us, you know. Not just her side. Your grandfather would be turning in his grave if he saw how she's acted, cutting us all off over a few rotten floorboards and a leaky roof." Tom finally looked at her, his jaw tight. "It was never about the house, Carol, and you know it. It was about what happened *in* the house." He dropped the fork onto the plate with a clatter, the small sound loud in the sudden silence between them. He walked away, leaving her standing alone amidst the half-eaten cake and forced festivities, the chasm between their two sides of the family as wide and impassable as ever.
