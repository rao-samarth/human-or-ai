I’m writing this on a late-night train, watching the dark fields rush by. It’s funny how you once told me I’d have the best view from the front, but all I see is the track ahead and the glare of our own lights. Everyone else can sleep, or read, or look back at where we’ve been. For me, there’s only this constant forward motion and the quiet hum of immense responsibility. They don't see the hundred small hesitations before I commit to a direction, or the way each potential wrong turn plays out in my mind a thousand times over. The hardest part isn’t the work itself, or the long hours. It’s the profound loneliness of the engine car, knowing that every single person’s journey depends on you keeping a steady hand on the controls, even when your own compass is spinning.
