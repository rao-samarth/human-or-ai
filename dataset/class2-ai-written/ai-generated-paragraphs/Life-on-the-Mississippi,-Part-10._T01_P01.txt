Maya found him sitting in the dark, the laptop screen casting a pale, cold light across his face. “So?” she asked, her voice soft in the quiet apartment. He didn’t look up, just kept staring at the single word on the screen: Pass. “I don’t know what to feel,” he finally said, his voice raspy. “I spent four years thinking this moment would feel like fireworks, like some grand finale. Instead, it just feels… quiet.” He finally turned to her, his eyes shadowed with an exhaustion that went bone-deep. “All those all-nighters, the endless reading, the feeling that I was constantly failing upwards. It’s all just… stopped.” She came over and gently closed the laptop. “Maybe quiet is what you earned,” she murmured. “The noise is over. You can finally just be done.”
