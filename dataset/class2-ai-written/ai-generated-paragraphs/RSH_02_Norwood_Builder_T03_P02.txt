The laughter from that table, it’s so easy. A sharp, bright sound cutting through the clatter of this café. It’s been fifteen years and I still find myself holding my breath when I hear a group of friends like that, waiting for the echo of a voice that isn't there. I wonder if he ever replays our last conversation, the one that split the world in two. Probably not. He likely shed the whole memory like a heavy coat and walked on into a lighter life. But I kept it. I took that anger and nursed it, kept it warm through every season until it became a part of my own architecture. It’s a bitter companion, this thing, a foundation I never wanted but built my whole adult life on anyway. I see it in how I hesitate with new people, in the way I look for the exit in every room. He's gone, but the damage he left behind is a house I still live in every single day.
