No, the worst part wasn't the noise, and it certainly wasn't some grand moment of courage you see in the films. It was the equipment. My helmet liner was too big, so every time I jogged, the whole thing would slip down over my eyes, and I’d be running blind. You’re trying to look heroic, I suppose, but you can’t see a thing and you're mostly just focused on not tripping over a rock. And my canteen! The cap was attached with this flimsy little chain that broke on day one, so I spent six months clanking everywhere I went. A constant, irritating *clink-clank-clink*. The big dramatic charge for the history books was really just me, half-blind, trying to hold my helmet up with one hand while my canteen chimed away like a broken windchime. The enemy probably heard me coming from a mile away and just felt sorry for me.
