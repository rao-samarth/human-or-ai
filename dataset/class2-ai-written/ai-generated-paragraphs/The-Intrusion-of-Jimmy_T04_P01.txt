The market was a blur of sound and color, a whirlwind of spices and shouted bargains, but all he saw was the way she smiled at a vendor selling silver charms. Then, a flash of movement. A wiry figure ripped the strap of her bag from her shoulder and sprinted into the labyrinth of stalls. He didn’t hesitate, didn't even think. He launched himself forward, vaulting over a cart of melons, his focus narrowed to a single point: the fleeing thief. The chase was a chaotic sprint through startled crowds. A sharp turn, a skid on loose gravel, and he was there, tackling the man in a clumsy, desperate lunge that sent them both sprawling. He returned moments later, breathing heavily, dust on his jeans and a fresh scrape on his elbow. He held out her bag, offering a slightly breathless apology for the commotion. But she wasn't looking at the recovered bag. Her eyes were fixed on his face, wide with a new and brilliant light, an expression that went far beyond simple gratitude.
