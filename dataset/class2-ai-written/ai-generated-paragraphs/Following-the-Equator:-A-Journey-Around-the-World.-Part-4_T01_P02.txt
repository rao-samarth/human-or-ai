Looking out from the bus, the grid is the most persistent legacy. It’s not just in the towns, with their numbered streets and identical administrative buildings, but in the countryside itself. Fields are carved into perfect rectangles, and entire forests have been replaced by plantations arranged in relentlessly straight lines. This is the logic of extraction, a system designed not to harmonize with the land but to subdue it, erasing whatever organic contours and ancient pathways existed before. It feels like an immense, indifferent machine was set down upon the landscape to rationalize it for distant markets. It reveals a mindset that sees a place not as a home, but as an asset to be cataloged, divided, and shipped away piece by piece.
