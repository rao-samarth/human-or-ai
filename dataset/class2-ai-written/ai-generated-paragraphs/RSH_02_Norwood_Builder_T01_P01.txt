The clinking of champagne flutes and the low hum of polite conversation filled the grand ballroom, a perfect camouflage for the ugliness I was witnessing. From my corner near the ornate bar, I saw him—impeccable in his tailored suit—nod almost imperceptibly to a server. The server, a ghost in a white jacket, then navigated the glittering crowd with a practiced ease. His target was a young executive, laughing with a group by the french doors, completely unaware. A slight, seemingly accidental jostle was all it took. In that brief moment of apology and feigned clumsiness, a small, dark object was slipped from the server's tray into the executive's coat pocket. I watched the older man turn away, a flicker of cold satisfaction in his eyes, his public mask of benevolence snapping perfectly back into place. The trap was set, and I was the only one who had seen the spring.
