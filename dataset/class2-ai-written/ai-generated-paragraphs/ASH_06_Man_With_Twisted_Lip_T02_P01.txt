The fields blur into a green smudge outside this window, just like the faces used to. They say I sold something essential, a piece of the town's soul, for a few extra points on the market. But you have to understand, it was never about malice. It was just... math. A cold, clean calculation. On one side of the ledger, you had tradition and handshakes and the way things had always been done. On the other, you had survival. Continued quarterly growth. I chose the numbers. I’d do it again. The invitations to neighborhood barbecues stopped coming, of course, but the invitations to boardrooms in cities like this one started arriving. You can’t have both, not really. You just have to decide which kind of quiet you can live with: the silence of an empty inbox or the silence of a town you no longer drive through.
