The fifty-dollar bill felt warm and self-righteous in my pocket. I’d been listening to the woman at the next table for ten minutes, her voice a quiet, frantic hum on the phone, and had already constructed the entire narrative: I would slip the cash onto her table as I left, a silent benefactor solving a simple, tragic problem of poverty. But the problem wasn't simple. "No, I have the bus fare," she was saying now, her frustration audible over the cafe's clatter. "The issue is the application is tomorrow morning, and they won't even let me in without a photo ID, which was in the wallet." My simple, clean gesture suddenly felt not just useless, but insulting. What was I supposed to do, walk over and offer a ride to the DMV? Interject myself, a total stranger, into the messy, bureaucratic failure of her day? The bill in my pocket now felt like a bribe to my own conscience, and the weight of doing nothing at all settled in as she finally hung up the phone with a quiet, defeated sigh.
