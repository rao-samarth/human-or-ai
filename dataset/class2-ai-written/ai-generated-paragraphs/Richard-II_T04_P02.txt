Gerald was on his feet again at the town hall meeting, his face flushed with the kind of passion usually reserved for championship games. He pounded the lectern, booming about civic duty and the absolute necessity of rolling up our sleeves to clean the muck from Miller’s Creek. His speech was magnificent; you could practically feel the town spirit swell in the room. He made it sound like we were about to liberate a nation, not just fish out old tires and soggy fast-food bags. So when Saturday morning arrived, a surprisingly large group of us showed up in our worst clothes, ready for battle. But our general was conspicuously absent. His wife later told Brenda he’d been pinned down by a "critically important, long-distance" phone call regarding a rare part for his model train set. We just sighed, pulled on our gloves, and got to work.
