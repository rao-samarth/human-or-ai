It's three in the morning and I’m staring at my great-grandfather’s medal. The ribbon is faded, but the bronze star still catches the dim light from the kitchen. I grew up on stories of his courage, of a righteous cause and a victory that shaped the world. They talked about him like he was a giant, a man who charged forward when everyone else was frozen in fear. But holding this small, cold piece of metal, I always wonder about the part of the story they left out. What did he see? What did he have to do to earn this thing? I think about the noise, the screaming, the absolute terror of it all that must be pressed into the metal along with the engraved letters of his name. It's a strange inheritance, this symbol of what a person can endure and what they can inflict. It’s both a monument and a scar, and late at night, in the quiet, you can almost feel the weight of both.
