Our quarterly town halls are always a masterclass in the spectacle of corporate virtue. The CEO stands before a polished slideshow, speaking with practiced sincerity about transparency and integrity, painting a picture of a company built on a solid ethical foundation where people are the priority. Everyone applauds at the right moments. Yet, in the quiet hum of the open-plan office, a different reality persists. It lives in the knowing glances exchanged when a project's "success" is announced, a success built on exhausted teams and uncredited work. It thrives in the way difficult questions are artfully deflected with jargon about synergy and forward-thinking paradigms. We have become experts in appreciating the architecture of morality, admiring its beautiful design from a distance while knowing we are forbidden from ever testing the strength of its actual foundations. It is a collective, unspoken agreement to praise the blueprint and never mention that the building itself is hollow.
