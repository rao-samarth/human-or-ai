Stealing a city bus for a getaway vehicle certainly subverted expectations, primarily because it was now wedged diagonally across a four-way intersection at the peak of rush hour. One of the masterminds, whose ill-fitting ski mask made his head look like a misshapen potato, was frantically trying to scoop spilled coins back into a flimsy gym bag with a plastic dustpan he’d apparently brought for this exact purpose. The cacophony of car horns served as a fittingly chaotic score for this monument to poor planning, while pigeons, the city’s truest opportunists, descended upon the loose change with religious fervor. A single police officer leaned against his cruiser, not with urgency, but with the profound, soul-deep weariness of a man who has seen the absolute bottom of the intellectual barrel and found someone still digging.
