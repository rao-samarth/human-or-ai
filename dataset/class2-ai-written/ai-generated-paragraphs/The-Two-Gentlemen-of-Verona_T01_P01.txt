The low hum of conversation filled the living room, punctuated by my uncle’s loud laughter from the kitchen. I watched him from my corner, a glass of lukewarm wine in my hand. He was with her, of course, his arm draped casually over the back of her chair. It was the same way he used to sit with me during these endless family things, a silent pact against the boredom. He’d lean in and whisper some ridiculous observation, and we’d share a smile that no one else understood. Now, he was whispering to her. He caught my eye for a second, a fleeting, almost apologetic flicker of a smile, before turning back completely. It wasn’t a betrayal, not really. It was just a reordering. A space that was once mine, so comfortably and exclusively mine, was now occupied, and I was just another relative in a crowded room, watching from the outside.
