You have to understand, what they see from the outside isn't the job. It's just the costume. They see the firm handshake, the decisive nod on a lit stage, and they believe that’s where the choices are made. The real work happens long after the lights go down, in rooms like this, with the world blurring past the window. It’s a constant, quiet calculus of loss. You weigh one bad outcome against another, slightly worse one, and you pick the path of least ruin. There’s no victory, just a series of managed failures. Every directive, every signature, carries a hidden price that someone, somewhere, has to pay. My role isn't to lead them to some grand future; it's to stand here and decide who pays it, then put on a brave face and pretend it was an easy decision.
