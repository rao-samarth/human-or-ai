From my kitchen window, the argument next door wasn't loud, just a stretch of heavy silence between two people standing too far apart near their rose bushes. He was gesturing at the untamed vegetable patch, but his words were clearly not about gardening. I knew what this was about; she had told me yesterday, her voice tight with resentment, and my well-meaning advice now felt like a stone in my own stomach. A part of me, a persistent and meddlesome part, was already composing the perfect, casual sentence to break the tension if I were to just wander over. Yet, what did I truly understand of their shared history, of the subtle currents running between them for years? I stood frozen, teacup in hand. To step across that low stone wall felt like inserting myself into a story where I had only read a single, biased page, risking a fire with a carelessly thrown match. The space between our properties suddenly felt vast, a chasm of respectful silence I was terrified to cross, and equally afraid not to.
