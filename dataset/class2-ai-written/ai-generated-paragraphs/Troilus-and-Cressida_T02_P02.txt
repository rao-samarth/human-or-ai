We used to think our connection was some profound, city-spanning epic, a real-life movie montage set against rainy streets and neon signs. We’d stay up all night talking about our dreams, convinced we could conquer anything as long as we had each other. It was all so terribly poetic. Then the boiler broke in February, the landlord hiked the rent again, and my commute started stealing two hours of my soul every day. Suddenly, those deep, late-night conversations were replaced by exhausted arguments over who forgot to buy milk. Our grand, cinematic love story got a brutal dose of reality, discovering that passion is a terrible currency for paying utility bills and that holding hands doesn't fix a leaky faucet. Who knew that the greatest threat to our unbreakable bond wasn't some dramatic betrayal, but the slow, grinding misery of a shared spreadsheet for household expenses?
