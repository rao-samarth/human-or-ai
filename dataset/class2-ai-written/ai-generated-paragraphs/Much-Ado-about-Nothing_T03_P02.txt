Look, I know what this feels like. It’s as if everything you’ve ever built was made of glass, and someone just threw a stone. The noise is deafening, and all you can see are the shards. But what they broke wasn't you. It was just a perception, an image that was always more fragile than you gave it credit for. Your character, the actual foundation of who you are, is still here. That’s what you build from now. You don't have to glue the old pieces back together; you get to build something new, something stronger that can withstand the next stone. This isn’t an ending. It’s the difficult, messy, but ultimately liberating start of proving what you’re really made of.
