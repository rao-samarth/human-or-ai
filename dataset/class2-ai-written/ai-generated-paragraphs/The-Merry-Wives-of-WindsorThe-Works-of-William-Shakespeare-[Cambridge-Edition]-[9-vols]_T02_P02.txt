Do you have any idea what you’ve done? Out there, in front of everyone? My boss was standing right there, smiling, and you stormed in with that look on your face, that rage I know so well. You didn't even ask. You just started accusing me, your voice rising until the whole restaurant went quiet. That silence… that was the sound of my professional life crumbling. All those years of work, of building respect and a reputation, and you shattered it in thirty seconds because you saw me laugh with a colleague. You didn't see a friendly conversation; you saw a betrayal that only existed inside your head. Now I have to walk into that office tomorrow, and every single person will remember your shouting, not my work. They'll remember the scene you made, the poison you spat. And for what? For a ghost you created yourself.
