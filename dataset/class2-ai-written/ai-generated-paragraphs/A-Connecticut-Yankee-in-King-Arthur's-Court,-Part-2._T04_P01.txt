The soil was still dark and cool from the night's dew. On the potting shed’s workbench, a smartphone glowed, showing a perfect five-day forecast and an optimized planting schedule from the agricultural extension. He glanced at it, his thumb hovering over the screen, then looked past it to the faded, dog-eared almanac his father had given him. The app said today was the day. But the almanac, and a deeper sense he couldn't name, said to wait. It was something about the phase of the moon, a rule passed down without words, a rhythm that felt more real in his bones than any algorithm. His grandfather had trusted that rhythm, and his fields were never barren. To plant now, a day early by the old reckoning, would feel fundamentally wrong, like humming a familiar song in the wrong key. He clicked the phone off. The seeds would wait.
