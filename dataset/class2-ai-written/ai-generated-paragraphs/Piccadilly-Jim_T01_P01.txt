It’s a curious thing, the person you become for a stranger. Here, on a train cutting through an unfamiliar countryside, it felt remarkably easy to claim I spent my summers sailing when, in reality, I’ve never been on a boat larger than a ferry. The lie wasn't malicious; it was an architecture of hope, a small scaffold built to reach the version of myself I thought they might admire. The details flow surprisingly well, coloring in the outlines of a more adventurous life than my own. Each shared smile and easy conversation now rests on that invented past, creating a connection that is both intensely present and fundamentally fragile. You start to analyze the half-truths, the careful omissions, and wonder how long you can live in a house you didn't actually build, especially when you begin to wish you could stay.
