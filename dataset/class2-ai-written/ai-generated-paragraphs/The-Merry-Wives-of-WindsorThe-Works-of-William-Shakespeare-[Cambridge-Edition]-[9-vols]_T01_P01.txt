The air in the town hall was stale with the drone of predictable ambition. He stood at the podium, a man with a city suit and a map of their future, all straight lines and profit margins laid over the gentle curves of the land she knew. He spoke of progress, using a voice that dismissed her and the other lifelong residents as quaint obstacles. When he finally finished, a smug silence settled, daring objection. She waited a moment, letting the silence breathe. Then, in a voice barely louder than the hum of the old radiator, she asked him about the winter floods, about the specific bend in the creek behind the old mill where the water always rose first. She didn't raise her voice. She didn't need to. The blankness that washed over his face was a victory quieter than applause, a small, sad vindication in a room where she knew the water would eventually rise no matter what she said.
