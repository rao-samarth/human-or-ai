Watching my aunt at the annual summer cookout is like observing a study in quiet negotiation. She never takes the best piece of chicken, always offers the most comfortable lawn chair to someone else, and patiently listens to the same rambling stories from her father-in-law that everyone else tries to escape. It isn't a dramatic performance of generosity; it's a series of small, almost imperceptible surrenders. Each one is a tiny abdication of her own preference for the sake of group harmony. I often wonder if she's even aware she's doing it, or if it has become an instinctual act over the years. The entire relaxed atmosphere of the afternoon, the sense of effortless peace, seems to be built upon these unacknowledged concessions. Her individual comfort is the currency she uses to purchase the collective contentment of everyone else present, a price no one else seems to realize is being paid.
