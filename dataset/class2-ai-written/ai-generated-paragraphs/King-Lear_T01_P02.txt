The sentence is that you will be responsible for all dishwashing duties for the next forty-eight hours.” He smiled, a picture of righteous satisfaction. The scales had been balanced; justice, in its purest form, had been served. Claire just sighed and wondered if pure justice always felt so much like someone just wanting to get out of doing the dishes.
