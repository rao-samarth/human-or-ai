Oh, look, Uncle David is telling that story again, the one about the leaky boat, punctuated by a laugh that doesn’t quite reach his eyes. Everyone chuckles along, a well-rehearsed chorus to a song they’ve heard a thousand times. They find his bitterness charming, a quirky personality trait. 'That’s just David,' they’ll say later, shaking their heads with a smile, conveniently forgetting the part where his art school portfolio was used as a doorstop for the family business he was guilted into inheriting. Forty years of sacrifice, and what’s the prize? The honor of being the designated 'character' at holiday dinners. He holds his glass just a little too tight. It’s a wonderful performance, really; you have to admire the commitment to the role, playing the part of the happy failure so everyone else can feel better about their own perfectly sensible, soul-crushing choices. Truly, it’s the gift that keeps on giving.
