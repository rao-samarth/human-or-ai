The clock on the stove just clicked over to 3:14 AM. Everyone says I should be celebrating, sleeping soundly for the first time in years. They use words like "exonerated" and "vindicated," but those words feel hollow, like they belong to a different person on a TV screen. The truth came out, sure. The papers printed a correction, a tiny little column on page seven. But how do you correct a memory? You can’t just erase the whispers in the grocery store or the way old friends suddenly got busy when you needed them most. They gave me back my name, but it feels worn out and thin, like a favorite shirt washed so many times it's about to fall apart. It's quiet in the house now, but the silence isn't peaceful. It's just empty, filled with the ghost of a life that was taken and only partially returned.
