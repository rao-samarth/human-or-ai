There’s an unspoken choreography to walking through a crowded city street, a kind of clumsy, unpracticed ballet that everyone is a part of. You see it in the way two strangers, approaching each other, perform that awkward side-step shuffle, both trying to be polite, both moving in the same wrong direction until they finally just stop, make eye contact, and share a laugh. A moment later, you might overhear a fragment of a serious-sounding phone call about a cat that refuses to eat anything but artisanal tuna. A delivery cyclist zips past with impossible grace, while just behind them, a man in a crisp suit meticulously hops over a puddle with the intense focus of an Olympian. It’s in these tiny, disconnected scenes of shared absurdity that you find the city’s real pulse. Everyone is just improvising their way through the day, and knowing you’re a part of this giant, unscripted comedy is a wonderfully comforting thought.
