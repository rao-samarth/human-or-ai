Moonlight spills across the polished wood floors, catching the silver frames on the mantelpiece where our smiling faces are frozen in moments that now feel like they belong to someone else. Anyone peeking through the window would see a picture of domestic bliss, a life carefully curated and flawlessly executed down to the last artfully arranged throw pillow. They would see order and warmth and assume it meant contentment. What they wouldn't feel is the crushing stillness, the way the air itself seems to hold its breath, waiting for a confrontation that never comes. This silence isn't peace. It’s the heavy blanket left after a fire has gone out, a quiet so profound it has its own deafening frequency. We've built such a beautiful set, but we forgot to write a script for what happens after the audience finally goes home.
