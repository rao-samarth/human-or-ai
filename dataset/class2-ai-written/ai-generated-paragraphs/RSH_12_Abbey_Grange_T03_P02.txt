The house settles around me in the deep quiet of night, its only sound the low hum of the refrigerator from the kitchen. It is in this stillness that the noise of the past returns most clearly. I remember the conviction, the absolute certainty that what I was about to do was not just right, but necessary. There was an image in my mind of myself as a shield, a bulwark against a coming tide, and I acted to make that image real. But the reality of the action was nothing like the purity of the motive. It wasn't a heroic stand; it was a messy, violent severance that broke more than just the intended target. Now, the person I meant to protect regards me with a caution that borders on fear, and I am left alone in the silence, wondering if the grand principle I served was ever anything more than a grand excuse.
