From the high floor, the city below seemed a model of perfect order, its streets a precise grid under the orange glow of the streetlights. It was a beautiful illusion. Down there, within that rigid framework, was the unpredictable flow of a million journeys, each driver making small, necessary compromises to advance—a sudden lane change, a yielded right-of-way, an ignored sign. An individual entering public service often carries a similar internal map, a clear set of principles they believe to be unalterable. But the daily navigation through competing interests and the pressure for consensus demands constant adjustments. A small deviation is made for the greater good, then another for simple expediency. Eventually, one has to wonder if they are still following their own route or just being carried along by the relentless, indifferent traffic of the system.
