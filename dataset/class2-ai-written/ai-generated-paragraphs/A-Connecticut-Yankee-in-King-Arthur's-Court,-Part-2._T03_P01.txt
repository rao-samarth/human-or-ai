The murmur of the party was a good backdrop for my mission. I was trying to show Uncle Carl the voice remote again, the one we all chipped in for. It’s supposed to make his life easier. I patiently explained, for what felt like the tenth time, that he didn't need to hunt for the tiny buttons anymore. "Just say what you want to watch," I told him, enunciating clearly as if that was the problem. He just squinted at the sleek black rectangle in his hand, his thumb hovering uselessly over the surface. Finally, he set it down with a sigh and grumbled something about missing the days when you could just turn a dial. It's baffling, really. We give them these amazing tools, these shortcuts to a better way, and they actively choose to stay stuck. He’d rather struggle than accept a simple gift of advancement.
