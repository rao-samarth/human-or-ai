The city hummed a low, persistent note outside the window, a mechanical lullaby for the grand, orderly world we'd constructed. Everything out there was designed for efficiency, for progress, a complex dance of rules and ambitions all dressed in glass and steel. Yet, sometimes, in the pre-dawn quiet, you could almost hear the gears grinding, feel the raw, ancient hunger that powered it all. But that wasn’t a cause for despair. Quite the opposite. It was a reminder that the most radical act was not to build another tower, but to cultivate something genuine in the quiet spaces. Here, within these walls, the simple act of leaving a light on for someone felt more revolutionary than any headline. It was a small, warm rebellion, a promise that our humanity wasn't something to be managed or optimized, but simply to be lived, softly and deliberately, in the pockets of stillness we carve out for ourselves.
