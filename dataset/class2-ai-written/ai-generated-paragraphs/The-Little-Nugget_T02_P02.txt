In the unceasing current of a metropolis, where millions of lives intersect without yielding, one can spot the tragic architecture of a soul shielded from every friction. These individuals were taught that their comfort was a paramount law, their desires a compass for all of reality. But the city offers a brutal, indifferent education. Here, a missed train is not a tragedy arranged for their learning, but a simple consequence of time and physics. A stranger’s shoulder jostling past is not a personal affront, but the chaotic geometry of a crowded sidewalk. The constant, ambient 'no' of urban life—the full cafe, the occupied taxi, the silent passerby—becomes a dissonant roar to an ear tuned only to 'yes'. Without the calluses formed by small disappointments, the spirit remains raw, unable to grasp that the world was never designed to be its soft cradle, and its vast, unfeeling machinery will not pause for a single, unearned cry.
