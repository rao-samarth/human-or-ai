The speaker up front keeps using that one strange phrase, “a recursive cascade.” It sounded clever the first time, but now it’s just lodged in my head, a pebble in my shoe. Then the woman to my left, while describing her vacation, called the traffic a “cascade of bad decisions.” Did she hear him? Suddenly, I'm hearing it everywhere, or echoes of it, stitched into the polite hum of the room. The clinking of forks on plates seems to beat out its rhythm, and the meaningless pleasantries exchanged across the table feel like they're just rearranging the same two words, over and over, into different shapes. It’s a kind of nonsense that's becoming its own weird logic. I feel like if I opened my mouth now, that's the only sound that would come out, this verbal contagion that has infected the whole sterile, air-conditioned space. I just want it to stop.
