You don’t get it. I was sitting right there in the waiting room when he tried to buy his son a bottle of water from the machine. He counted out his coins, this little pile of silver and copper, and he came up short. Not by much, maybe a quarter. He just sighed, this quiet, defeated sound, and swept the change back into his palm. His kid just looked at the floor. Meanwhile, I was mentally rescheduling a flight, annoyed that I’d have to pay the fee, a fee that was probably a hundred times what that man was holding. I just watched him lead his son away, thirsty. In that sterile, silent room, it felt like we were separated by more than just a few feet of linoleum; it was a chasm so deep that my world of cancellation fees and his world of loose change couldn't even exist on the same plane.
