Across the table, my uncle leaned forward, his fork forgotten beside a cooling piece of roast. “It’s about a real future, Sarah, not just a hobby,” he insisted, his voice carrying a well-meaning but heavy certainty. He was talking about her pottery studio, the one she’d poured her savings and soul into for the last three years. He’d already laid out a five-year plan for her, a sensible path involving a business degree and a marketing job at his firm, a world away from clay-dusted hands and the kiln’s unpredictable heat. Sarah didn’t argue. She just gave a small, tight nod, her gaze dropping to the patterned dishware. The vibrant energy she’d had while describing her new glaze vanished, replaced by a quiet resignation. A sudden silence fell over our section of the table, making the clinking of distant silverware seem impossibly loud. He thought he was offering her a better map, never realizing she was already exactly where she wanted to be.
