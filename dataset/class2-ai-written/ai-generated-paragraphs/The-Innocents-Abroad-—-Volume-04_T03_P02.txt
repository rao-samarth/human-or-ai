The view from the upper tier of the Colosseum was supposed to be profound. My uncle Barry, however, was mainly focused on getting the perfect selfie with his half-eaten pistachio gelato. He leaned back dramatically for a better angle, caught his foot on my cousin’s abandoned stroller, and the gelato arced beautifully through the air before landing with a wet, green splat on two-thousand-year-old stone. My seven-year-old nephew immediately began wailing, not for the desecration of a world wonder, but because “the good bit with the nut” was now seeping into ancient Roman history. Barry, flustered, started dabbing at the sticky mess with a cheap souvenir map of the city. I looked out over the ruins of the Forum, imagining legions and emperors, and found it hard to believe their epic story had culminated in this: a small, undignified dairy incident.
