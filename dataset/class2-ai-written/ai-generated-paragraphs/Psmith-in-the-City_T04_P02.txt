There’s a certain kind of person who wears their authority like a borrowed coat, two sizes too big. They puff up their chests and speak in pronouncements, expecting the architecture of the room itself to nod in agreement. But they miss the vital truth that respect is never an obligation; it’s a quiet, negotiated thing. Young people see this instantly. They haven't yet learned to pretend that the emperor’s ill-fitting coat is a magnificent robe. They simply look, unimpressed, and in their silence, the entire performance collapses. That's the real challenge to power, isn't it? Not a shouted slogan or a thrown stone, but the simple, unblinking refusal to participate in the charade. It’s a quiet rebellion that says your certainty is a costume, and I can see the stitching.
