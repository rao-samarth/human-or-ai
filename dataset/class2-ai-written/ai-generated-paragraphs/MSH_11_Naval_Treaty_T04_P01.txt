"I must admit, I'm surprised to see you out," Davies said, his voice smooth but edged with malice. "After the unfortunate business last year, I assumed you'd prefer the shadows." He took a slow sip of his drink, not breaking eye contact. Instead of flinching, he simply met the older man's gaze. "It took time, but crawling into a hole solves nothing. I’ve been busy." Davies scoffed. "Busy with what? Mending fences?" "Building them, actually," he replied, his tone even. "The youth center on the east side? I laid the foundation myself. My name might still be mud to people like you, but for those kids, it's the name on the door."
