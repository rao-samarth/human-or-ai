The grandfather clock in the hall just struck two, its chime a dull thud in the suffocating silence. For thirty years, I’ve tuned out the normal sounds of this house, listening instead for an echo that never fades: the sharp click of a courtroom door sealing a fate that should have been mine. It was just a small lie, a simple omission to save myself, but it grew roots inside my chest, a dark, heavy thing that has spent decades slowly squeezing the air out of me. Everyone talks about the weight of the world, but nobody mentions the weight of a single, uncorrected moment. This life, this comfortable home, it's all built on that rotten foundation. The bottle on the nightstand doesn’t feel like an escape anymore. After all this time, it feels like the only honest thing I’ve done since that day—a final, quiet correction.
