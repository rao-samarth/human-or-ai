The woman offered a smile that was all teeth, nudging the plate an inch away with a manicured finger as he retreated. She then leaned in, her voice a conspicuous whisper. “You’d think basic hygiene would be a given,” she murmured, glancing at her own perfect nails. “It’s just sad, really. The lack of self-respect.”
