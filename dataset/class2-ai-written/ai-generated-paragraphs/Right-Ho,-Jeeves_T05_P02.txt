So, I'm sitting here at that little cafe on Grove, and you are not going to believe this. Remember how Clara broke up with Ben? Well, he just asked *me* out, right here, over the lukewarm lattes. The sheer audacity. But that’s not even the best part. To make him jealous, Clara has apparently decided to go on a date with his roommate, David, who she can't stand. David, bless his simple heart, thinks Clara’s sudden attention is a sign from the universe. Meanwhile, I'm stuck here trying to explain to Ben, who is oblivious, that his ex-girlfriend is about to have a fake date with his roommate purely to manipulate him, while I just wanted a quiet afternoon. It’s like watching a terrible play where everyone has the wrong script, and I've somehow been cast as the bewildered narrator. I need more coffee for this.
