I remember sitting in Sarah’s office after the entire launch tanked. I had my resignation speech basically memorized, fully expecting to be shown the door. I had failed, publicly and spectacularly. But instead of the lecture I was bracing for, she just listened while I stumbled through my apologies. When I finished, she didn't rehash the mistakes. She simply slid a new project brief across her desk—the big one for the next quarter. Her giving me the lead on that felt like a bigger vote of confidence than my initial hiring ever did. It completely rewired my thinking. Suddenly, the goal wasn't just to redeem myself or avoid another mistake; it was to prove that her faith in me wasn't misplaced. That single act of trust unlocked a level of focus and dedication I didn't even know I had.
