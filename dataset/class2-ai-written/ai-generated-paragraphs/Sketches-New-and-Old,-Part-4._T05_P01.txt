The printer is jammed again, a small but perfect cosmic joke played out in beige plastic. We design algorithms that can predict markets and build instruments that can listen to the universe's first whispers, yet this machine has decided my quarterly report is an existential threat to its being. There's a strange, almost philosophical purity to its defiance; it has no regard for deadlines, no concept of urgency, only a mechanical commitment to obstruction. Soon, the familiar ritual begins.

In this shared moment of complete impotence before an unthinking object, the only rational response becomes a quiet, collective laughter at the sheer absurdity of it all.
