The silence was the worst part. Yesterday, this floor had thrummed with the energy of a hundred tiny victories, the clatter of keyboards composing a symphony of progress. Today, the only sound was the sterile hum of the servers, a monotonous drone that underscored our collective failure. I watched my team, their faces illuminated by the cold glow of their monitors, each person lost in their own private replay of the morning’s brutal conference call. The project was gone. Months of our lives, our best ideas, our late nights—all of it deleted with a single executive decision. I felt the familiar, bitter sting of collapse creeping in, the urge to just pack my things and walk away. But then I saw Maya at her desk, methodically sketching a new logo in her notebook, not for any assignment, but for herself. It was a quiet, defiant act. A tiny flicker in the oppressive gloom, a reminder that the fire that drove us wasn't fueled by project codes or deadlines, but by something more fundamental within us that refused to be extinguished.
