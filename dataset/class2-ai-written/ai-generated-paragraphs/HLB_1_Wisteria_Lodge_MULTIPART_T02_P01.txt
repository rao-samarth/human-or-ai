Every gesture was practiced and gentle, an act of care so convincing it almost silenced the frantic alarm bells ringing in my soul. He spoke of the future, his voice a low, soothing murmur painting pictures of a life I desperately wanted to believe in. But when he stepped into the dim light, the steaming mug held out like a peace offering, I saw it. The smile never reached his eyes. They were cold, placid pools reflecting a terrifying finality. This perfect, loving ritual, this carefully constructed scene of domestic peace, was a lie. The warmth from the ceramic against my trembling hands was not comfort; it was the last lie I would ever feel.
