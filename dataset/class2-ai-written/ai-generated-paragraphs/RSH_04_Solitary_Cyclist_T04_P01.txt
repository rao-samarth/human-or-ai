I swear this place has ghosts, but the helpful kind. Last Friday, I completely botched the quarterly projections. I mean, I left a whole division’s data out and didn't catch it until I was halfway home on the train. I spent the entire weekend dreading Monday morning, picturing my boss’s face and mentally updating my resume. But when I logged in, the file on the shared drive was different. It was corrected. Perfectly. My mistake was just gone, replaced with a version time-stamped from late Friday night, long after I’d left. I haven't said a word to anyone, and nobody has said anything to me. It’s not the first time, either. It’s like there are these invisible guardrails here, set up by people you never see, who just quietly nudge you back on track before you can fall. It's a strange sort of comfort.
