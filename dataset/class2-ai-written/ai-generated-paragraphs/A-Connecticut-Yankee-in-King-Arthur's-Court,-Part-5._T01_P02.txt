From the cafe window, the street shimmered under the constant glow of holographic advertisements. A man on the opposite corner was performing one of the old rites, his hands weaving intricate patterns in the air to shape a ward of protection around a small, chalk-drawn circle. A few decades ago, such a display might have drawn a crowd, a flicker of genuine power for all to see. Now, however, pedestrians streamed past, their attention captured by the data feeds in their optical implants. The ward itself seemed to struggle, its faint shimmer disrupted and made irrelevant by the wash of wireless signals and ambient energy radiating from the city's infrastructure. It was a fragile, analog whisper in a digital hurricane. His ritual was not so much defeated as it was simply ignored into impotence, a folk memory trying to assert itself in a world that had long since coded superior solutions.
