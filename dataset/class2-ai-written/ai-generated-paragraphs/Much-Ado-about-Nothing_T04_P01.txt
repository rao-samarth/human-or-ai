Out here, where the loudest sound is usually the wind moving through the long grass, our conversation creates its own kind of weather. It’s a game of sharp edges and soft landings, a duel where the blades are carefully weighted metaphors and the aim is not to draw blood but to see the spark of recognition in the other’s eyes. Every sentence is a volley, every question a feint, designed to test the agility of the other's mind. There's a particular kind of affection in this intellectual sparring, a way of mapping the contours of another's thoughts without ever having to ask for directions. It isn't an argument seeking a victor, but a dance where the prize is simply finding a partner who knows the steps. In the quiet space between a clever retort and its anticipated reply, a silent understanding forms, more solid than anything plainly spoken.
