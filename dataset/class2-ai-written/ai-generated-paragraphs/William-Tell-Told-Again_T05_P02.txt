It’s so late, but I can’t sleep. I keep replaying what I saw in the square today. When that woman refused to step aside for the patrol, the silence was louder than any shout. Everyone just froze, waiting for the inevitable, but she just stood there. She didn't even look angry, just… done. They dragged her away, of course, but for that one moment, she was free, and we all saw it. I saw the looks on people's faces as they turned away afterwards. It wasn't just fear anymore, not entirely. It was something else, a little flicker of a question. Sitting here in the quiet, I realize we’ve all been holding our breath for years. Today, for just one second, she let it out. And now I can’t stop thinking about what it would feel like to breathe again, really breathe, all at once.
