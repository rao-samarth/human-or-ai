Standing by the checkout, I saw Mr. Gable do it. He was emptying the donation jar for the town’s new park benches, his weathered face set in its usual expression of quiet diligence. Everyone here trusts him implicitly; he’s the man who will stop his truck in the rain to help you change a flat tire. But as he turned his back for a moment, I saw his hand dip into the pile of cash, quick as a blink, and a folded twenty vanished into his worn coat pocket. His eyes swept the store and slid right past me, seeing nothing. My own pulse hammered in my ears. Confront him? The idea felt like a betrayal. Maybe he needed it for medicine, maybe I had misjudged the entire situation. The cashier called my name, pulling me forward, and I was suddenly trapped between two impossible choices: to shatter an illusion our whole community was built on, or to become a silent partner in its lie.
