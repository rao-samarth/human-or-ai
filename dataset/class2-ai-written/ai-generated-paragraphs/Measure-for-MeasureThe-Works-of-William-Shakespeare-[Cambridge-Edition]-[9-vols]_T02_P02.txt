It’s not the obvious wrongdoing that’s unsettling; it’s the sheer elegance of the structure. The public sees the generous grants, the new community center, the scholarships for deserving students. It's an impeccable image. But if you follow the paperwork, you notice a strange circularity. The land for that center was sold by a holding company connected to a board member, at a significant profit, just before the grant was announced. The scholarships are administered by a firm run by the chairman’s nephew. None of it is illegal, not in a way you could easily prosecute. Each action, viewed in isolation, is perfectly defensible, even admirable. It’s only when you see how the pieces lock together that you realize the entire machine is designed to enrich the people who built it, all while wearing a halo.
