The drone of polite conversation felt like a physical weight, a thick blanket muffling the world. I watched a woman across the room throw her head back in laughter, a silent movie of joy that seemed to play on a distant screen. My own smile was a mask I had affixed hours ago, the muscles beneath it stiff and unfamiliar from the effort. Someone raised a glass for a toast, their words about bright futures and new beginnings dissolving into meaningless sound before they could reach me. It was all just noise and light, a carefully staged performance of happiness I was meant to be a part of. But my world had shrunk to a small, quiet room inside my head, and the door was locked. The sharp clink of a fork against a plate was the only sound that truly registered, a singular, piercing note in the vast, empty space where your voice used to be.
