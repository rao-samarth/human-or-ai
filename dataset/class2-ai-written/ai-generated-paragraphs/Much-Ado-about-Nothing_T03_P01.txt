Harold had spent three decades cultivating his reputation as the foremost ornithologist in the parish, a man whose pronouncements on finch migration were considered gospel. So when he spotted the elusive Dusky-Crested Flycatcher, a bird not seen in the county since 1958, a reverent crowd gathered on the village green. He pointed his binoculars with theatrical gravity, describing its subtle plumage and unique, lilting call—a delicate *chirp-whirr*. He spoke for a full ten minutes, a monologue on its nesting habits and dietary peculiarities. The silence was broken only when little Molly, daughter of the new postmaster, tugged on her mother’s sleeve and asked loudly why Mr. Henderson’s new solar-powered bird feeder was making that funny noise again. A collective, awkward shift rippled through the onlookers as all eyes turned from Harold to the small plastic bird chirping mechanically from its perch on a nearby fence post.
