The entire operation hinged on the structural integrity of the old Dutch barn’s main crossbeam. From there, we ran a nearly invisible network of fishing line connected to a series of simple pulleys. One line would gently swing the rusted scythe hanging on the wall, while another was rigged to slowly hoist a burlap sack into the rafters, creating the illusion of a levitating form. The audio element, a looped recording of creaking timbers and a low moan played from a small Bluetooth speaker hidden in a hayloft, was perhaps the least elegant part of the design. It wasn't about a sudden scare. The goal was to build a sustained, unnerving atmosphere for the cousins who would be exploring the property that weekend. Everything had to be meticulously timed from a lookout post in the adjacent woods, a small-scale piece of theater performed for an audience of three.
