He walked the familiar path past the humming servers toward her corner desk, a fresh coffee in his hand—oat milk, two sugars, just how she’d mentioned she liked it that one time, months ago. She didn't look up from her screen, the focused line of her brow telling him she was deep in code. Most people would have taken that as a signal to retreat, a clear "do not disturb" sign written in the tense set of her shoulders. But he saw it differently, as a challenge, an opportunity to be the one bright spot that could break through her concentration. He placed the cup gently on the corner of her desk, just outside her immediate field of vision. She startled slightly, her eyes flicking from the screen to the cup, then to him. Her smile was polite, brief, and carried the weight of a dozen previous attempts. "You didn't have to do that," she said, her voice quiet. He just smiled back, a little wider than necessary. "I wanted to." He’d be back tomorrow.
