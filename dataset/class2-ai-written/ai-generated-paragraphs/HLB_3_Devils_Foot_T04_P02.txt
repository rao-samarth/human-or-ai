You keep asking me about that one day, as if it was a single, clean decision. It wasn't. It was more like a subtle hum that slowly gets louder until it’s the only thing you can hear. At first, you dismiss the small inconsistencies—a key not where you left it, a conversation you remember differently than someone else. You tell yourself you’re just tired. But then the small things start to pile up, and the world begins to feel like a room where the furniture has been moved just one inch to the left. It’s all still there, but nothing is quite right. Soon, you stop trusting what you see. You stop trusting your own memory. It’s not one big, dramatic break. It’s a thousand tiny fissures that spiderweb across your foundation until you realize, far too late, that you're standing on nothing at all.
