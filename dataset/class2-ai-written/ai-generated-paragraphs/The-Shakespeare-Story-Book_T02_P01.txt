Do you ever just step back and look at the actual cost? It’s not about who was right in that fight twenty years ago. It’s about the silence that has filled this house, a silence so complete it has erased whole parts of our history. We don’t have shared memories anymore, just competing versions of old grievances. Holidays are just logistical minefields we navigate to avoid another explosion. The resentment became the central pillar of this family, and now that it’s all we have, the whole structure is collapsing in on itself. There's nothing left to inherit but the bitterness. We’re not preserving a legacy; we’re just guarding the ruins of one, and I honestly don't know why we keep doing it.
