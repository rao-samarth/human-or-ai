The women at the table next to me were whispering about it, glancing up at the muted news screen. “Just last year they were naming streets after him,” one murmured. I saw the footage they were watching: old clips of roaring crowds and immaculate parades, then the jarring cut to a man shuffling into a drab government building. It’s a dizzying trajectory, I thought, watching his face flicker on the screen. One moment you're carved in stone, the next they’re looking for hammers. It must feel so absolute from the top, like standing on a mountain. But the mountain isn’t rock; it’s just the shifting shoulders of a million people who can decide, all at once, to shrug. And the fall from that height is silent until you hit the ground.
