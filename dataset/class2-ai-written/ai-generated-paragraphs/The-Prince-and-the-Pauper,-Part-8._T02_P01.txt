I know what you’re thinking. You think I’ve gone soft. I would have thought the same thing ten years ago. Back then, the lines were clear. You cross one, you pay the price. Simple. I built my entire career on that simple idea, and I was proud of it. But then I watched someone I trusted, someone I knew to be a good man, get backed into a corner so tight he thought breaking the law was the only way out. He wasn't evil. He was just... desperate. It didn't excuse what he did, not at all, but it changed how I saw the act itself. It’s not enough to just see the foul line they crossed; you have to look back and see the path that led them right up to it. Sometimes the most important facts of a case aren’t in any official report.
