The polite laughter felt like sandpaper against my skin, each quiet chuckle a fresh irritation. A forest of starched collars and tight smiles shifted under the chandeliers, a slow, predictable dance of wealth and influence I couldn't take for another second. My gaze scanned the perimeter, past the waiters with their silver trays and the string quartet sawing away at something classical and forgettable. Then I saw it—a service door, propped open just a crack, leaking the frantic energy of the kitchen. That was the escape. Without a second thought, I set my glass down on a passing tray and moved, weaving through conversations about stocks and summer homes. The air grew hotter, smelling of garlic and hot metal as I slipped through the opening. The sudden clatter of pans and shouted orders was a relief, a jolt of raw, unscripted reality in a night suffocating on performance.
