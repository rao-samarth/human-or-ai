I wish you were here to see this. I’m out on the deck, watching the whole family buzz around the yard, and he’s holding court by the grill, of course. He has a glass of something expensive in one hand while he recounts his latest corporate victory to a captive audience of cousins. His wife is standing beside him, smiling, but it’s the same practiced, brittle expression she’s had for years, and his own children seem to orbit him at a safe distance. People listen, they nod politely, but their eyes drift away towards the lawn games and easier conversations. It’s strange; he spent his entire life climbing so he could have all of this, this sprawling house and manicured lawn, only to end up completely alone in the middle of it all. He's explaining the genius of a hostile takeover, and I don't think he realizes he’s already lost everything that was ever truly his.
