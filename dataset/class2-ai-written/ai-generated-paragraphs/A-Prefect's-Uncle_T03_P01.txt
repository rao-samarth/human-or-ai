Sometimes I just stand on a street corner and watch the whole show. The city planners did their best, you know? They laid out this perfect grid, timed the walk signals down to the second, and directed the river of traffic into clean, predictable lanes. Everyone is supposed to follow the script. But nobody ever does, not really. A siren suddenly rips through the air, and all that careful choreography falls apart as cars pull over at random. A gust of wind snatches a newspaper and sends it tumbling end over end into the street, a chaotic ballet of paper against pavement. You see people darting between cars, jaywalking against the light, their individual urgencies overriding the system. It’s this constant, beautiful mess where the blueprint for how things *should* be is always at war with how they actually are.
