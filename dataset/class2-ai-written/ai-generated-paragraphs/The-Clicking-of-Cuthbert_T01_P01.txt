I remember last Tuesday at the pub’s open mic night. This new guy, some slick city transplant, got up with a guitar that probably cost more than my car. He played perfectly, hitting every note just right, but it felt like he was reading from a script. He smiled at all the right moments, trying so hard to sell us an image of a soulful artist. The applause was polite. But then Maya from the corner store shuffled onto the stage. She was nervous, clutching her beat-up acoustic guitar, and she sang this quiet, simple song about watching the seasons change from her window. Her voice cracked once, but nobody cared because it was honest. The silence in the room when she finished was heavy, and then the clapping wasn’t just polite; it was earned. People weren’t just hearing music; they were feeling something real.
