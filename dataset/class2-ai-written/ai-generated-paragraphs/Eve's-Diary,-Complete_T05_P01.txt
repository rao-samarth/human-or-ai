You keep asking me where my head is. Honestly? A few hours ago, I was watching the frost etch itself onto the kitchen window. It wasn't anything special, just the way the cold works, but it looked like a whole frozen forest, a world of tiny white ferns that only existed for an hour. It’s gone now, of course. Yesterday, it was the way the setting sun caught the edge of a broken bottle in the alley, making it glow amber for just a second. I don’t know how to explain it, but these moments feel more solid to me than anything else. They don't demand anything. They just appear, and then they vanish, and the silence they leave behind feels like the only true thing.
