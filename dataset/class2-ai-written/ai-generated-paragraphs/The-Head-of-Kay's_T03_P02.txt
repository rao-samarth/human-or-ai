It all started because I was watering my petunias and Mrs. Gable has very thin porch screens. I heard her on the phone, her voice firm, saying, "No, it's decided. We're finally getting rid of the old man this weekend. He's lumpy, he smells a bit musty, and frankly, he's a complete eyesore." My blood ran cold. Her father, a sweet though slightly grumpy widower, lived with her. I spent the next two days in a quiet panic, subtly asking people at the post office if they’d seen Mr. Henderson looking unwell. By Saturday morning, a prayer circle had been organized, and someone had anonymously left a casserole and a brochure for assisted living on her doorstep. The town’s collective anxiety was palpable until I saw Mrs. Gable and her son wrestling a truly hideous, plaid recliner out to the curb for trash day. I’ve never wanted to hide in my own hedges so badly.
