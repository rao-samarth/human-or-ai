Oh, you’re absolutely right. I couldn’t possibly grasp the sheer architectural genius it took to construct this little empire of yours. You were busy drawing the blueprints, declaring which towers would scrape the heavens, and I deeply admire that vision. Someone, however, had to be down in the mud mixing the mortar, paying the masons, and noticing when your grand columns were about to be erected on a sinkhole. That part was apparently beneath the notice of the master builder. So please, continue explaining your magnificent design. It’s fascinating. But don’t be surprised if the whole glorious structure comes crashing down the moment the person who actually knows how the plumbing works decides to turn off the water.
