The house is so quiet tonight you can almost hear the dust settling. It’s that deep, 3 AM silence where the only thing moving is the hum of the refrigerator and the frantic beat of a moth against the window screen. I was just staring at my hand, at the web of lines on my palm, and had this sudden, hollow feeling that this body isn't really mine. It’s just a rental, a temporary vehicle I was assigned at the start. One day, the lease is up. There are no extensions, no negotiations with the landlord. You just turn in the keys. Every single person who ever lived has had to turn in their keys. The moth stops moving. The silence in the room feels a little bit bigger now, and the steady, indifferent hum of the refrigerator goes on and on.
