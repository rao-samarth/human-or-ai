Staring out the train window, I watched small towns and patchwork fields slide past, each one a story I would never know. It’s easy to get fixated on the human-made dramas played out in official buildings, the verdicts that miss the mark and the scales that never seem to quite balance. But out here, with the world moving so steadily, you get a sense of a different kind of correction. It’s not loud or immediate. It’s in the way a wronged person finds peace years later, a quiet strength that no judgment could ever grant or take away. It’s in the slow, inevitable fading of a false legacy. The world has its own gentle, persistent way of setting things right, a current that flows long after our own frantic efforts have ceased. There’s a profound comfort in that, in trusting a rhythm much larger than our own.
