Amid the press of bodies and the distant wail of a siren, a different kind of construction takes place, one far more meticulous than any skyscraper. It is the careful architecture of the self presented to the world. Each interaction is a stone laid, every public glance a moment of intense inspection. The actual truth of one's inner life becomes secondary, a messy blueprint hidden away in a locked drawer while the gleaming facade is what matters—the polished marble of perception that must remain uncracked at all costs. Small compromises are made, then larger ones, each a quiet sacrifice on the altar of how one is perceived. The fundamental fear is not of being wrong, but of being *seen* as wrong. And so, the person becomes the relentless curator of their own myth, walking through the anonymous crowds as a perfect, hollowed-out statue of who they are supposed to be.
