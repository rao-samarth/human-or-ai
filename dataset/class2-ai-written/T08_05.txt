From the seat across the aisle, their hushed but intense conversation was impossible to ignore. It was a simple story: a local merchant driven out of business by a competitor's deliberate slander. One man, tracing patterns on the fogged window, argued for a structured restitution—a repayment of losses, a formal apology printed in the local paper. He spoke of the system, of what was fair and necessary to correct the wrong that had been done. The other shook his head, his voice low and firm, insisting that such a response was toothless and that only an equal measure of personal ruin could truly settle the score. As the train moved through the unfamiliar landscape, their argument highlighted the thin, wavering line between making things right and the simple, consuming need to make someone hurt. The core of their disagreement wasn't about the facts, but about who holds the authority to weigh the harm and dispense the consequences—an impersonal mechanism or the aggrieved individual himself.
