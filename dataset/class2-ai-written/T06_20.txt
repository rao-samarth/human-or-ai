An older man was speaking softly to his companion on the park bench, his words drifting over on the afternoon breeze. “You see, the real poison isn't wanting what they have. That’s a simple, childish ache. The trouble begins when their happiness feels like your failure, when their good news arrives as a personal indictment. It’s a quiet sickness that convinces you their gain must somehow be your loss, as if success were a zero-sum game played out across all of humanity. You start to measure your own life against a distorted image of theirs, a life you can only see the polished surface of. Before you know it, you're not just watching them with a critical eye; you're scrutinizing your own worth, and always, always finding it lacking by comparison.” He fell silent then, watching a child chase a flock of pigeons into the sky.
