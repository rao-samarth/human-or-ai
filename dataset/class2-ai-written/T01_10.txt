The scent of grilled hot dogs and my aunt’s too-sweet perfume hangs heavy in the humid afternoon air. My sister is retelling a story about her disastrous camping trip, and the whole patio erupts in laughter. I smile along, but my mind is somewhere else, replaying this morning’s call with the board. I got everything I demanded. The title, the equity, the public acknowledgment of my work. It was a summit I'd spent years climbing, sacrificing weekends and relationships along the way. Yet, sitting here, listening to a simple story about a raccoon and a stolen cooler, that victory feels strangely thin, almost transparent. Everyone here measures their life in moments like these—shared jokes and chaotic, loving afternoons. I measured mine in milestones, and I can't shake the feeling that I've been using the wrong ruler all along.
