He slid the whiskey across the table, a triumphant grin splitting his face. I didn’t touch it. Instead, I tossed the data chip onto the polished wood between us. It skittered to a stop, a tiny black rectangle of absolute betrayal. “You want to celebrate?” I asked, my voice dangerously low. “The drive you gave them was a ghost. Wiped. Every byte of our work replaced with a looping string of nonsense code before they even plugged it in.” They have nothing. His smile didn’t just fade; it collapsed. The confident partner I’d trusted for six months evaporated, leaving only a cornered stranger with shifting eyes trying to calculate his odds. All the shared risks, the close calls, the jokes over bad coffee—it was just a long-form lie, a meticulously constructed stage. So I asked him again, leaning forward until the glass of whiskey was the only thing separating us, “Tell me what we’re celebrating.”
