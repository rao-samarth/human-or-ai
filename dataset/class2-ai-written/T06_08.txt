The path along the creek winds through the tall grass, the same as it always has. I came out here to clear my head after that call with Mark, but the quiet only makes his voice louder. He was so excited about the new studio, the big commission, the way everything was just falling into place for him. I said all the right things, of course. “That’s amazing,” and “I’m so happy for you.” And some part of me is. But another, smaller part, the part that’s taken root in my gut, just keeps asking, *why not me?* It’s a bitter question that sours the sweet smell of the damp earth. Every step I take feels heavier, as if I’m dragging the weight of his success behind me while my own dreams gather dust. The water just keeps flowing, indifferent, and I can't help but feel I’m stuck standing on the bank.
