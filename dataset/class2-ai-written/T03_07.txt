The story about Mr. Henderson at the pharmacy started small, a simple prescription mix-up that was corrected in minutes with no harm done. But in a town of this size, a whisper needs very little room to grow into a shout. By Tuesday, the gossip had morphed it into a near-fatal error; by Friday, it was part of an alleged pattern of negligence. I watched him that week, his movements behind the counter remaining as precise and measured as ever. He didn’t post a notice on the door or rush to defend himself in the town square. Instead, he began offering free blood pressure checks and spent noticeably longer with each customer, explaining their medications with painstaking detail. It was a slow, expensive form of repair, both in time and in the business he was surely losing, but he seemed to understand that a good name, once damaged, isn't fixed with a loud declaration but with quiet, consistent, and visible acts of care.
