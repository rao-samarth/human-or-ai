The man with the too-wide smile cornered me near a spice stall, his voice a low conspiracy as he unveiled a small pouch of what he called “flawless” gems, acquired through a special family connection. For a moment, the math was intoxicating; a small investment here could fund the rest of my journey, and then some. The calculation flickered behind my eyes—a quick, clever profit that no one would ever have to know about. But then I looked past his shoulder, at the woman haggling cheerfully over a stack of bright silks and the kids laughing as they chased a stray dog down the alley. I simply smiled, shook my head, and walked on. Suddenly, the heavy, humid air seemed to lift, and the chaotic sounds of the market felt vibrant instead of overwhelming. The simple, honest pleasure of just being here, a stranger free to wander, felt more valuable than any secret treasure he could have offered.
