Every time I walk past the general store, I feel their eyes on my back. They see a shattered engagement and think they know the whole story, reducing my life to a line item in the town ledger of scandals. They saw David and me as a foregone conclusion, two straight lines destined to run parallel forever on this tiny map. But a life planned out by neighbors and parents isn't a life at all; it's a sentence. They don't understand that his quiet dependability had started to feel like a cage, each predictable kindness another bar locking me in. When Elias came back to town, it wasn't a choice so much as a recognition of something I’d been starving for. He talked about places where the sky was bigger, where you didn't have to be the person you were at sixteen. So let them whisper. They’re mourning a future that was never mine to begin with, while I’m finally learning to breathe.
