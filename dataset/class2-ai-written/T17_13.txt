He was asleep when I said it, which I know now was the first mistake. The train had stopped for longer than usual, and all I told him was, "I'm just grabbing water. If the whistle blows before I'm back, you handle the bags." That was it. I thought the meaning was obvious: just get them ready to go, or at worst, pull them onto the platform right here. But when I returned from the next car, his seat was empty. The bags were gone. I looked out the window as we started to pull away and saw him standing there, looking confused, holding both of our packs. He must have thought I meant for him to get off entirely. In that one moment, with him on the ground and me on the departing train, I understood that he had our passports, the tickets, all of our cash. I had nothing but a bottle of water and the clothes on my back.
