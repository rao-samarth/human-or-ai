Oh, just stop it. Seriously. You’ve been wearing that concerned expression for three hours now, and I think your face muscles are starting to cramp. It’s quite the performance, I’ll give you that. The furrowed brow, the gentle hand on my arm—it's all perfectly calibrated, like something you practiced in the mirror. It's almost convincing, except I've seen the script. I know all your lines. What's the real game here, hmm? Are you angling for sympathy, or just trying to figure out how much I know before you switch to a different character? It must be exhausting, keeping track of all the roles you play. I'm not even mad anymore. Honestly, it's just sad. You've built this entire life out of smoke and cheap stage props, and you're the only one who still believes the show is real.
