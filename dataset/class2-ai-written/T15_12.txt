He knew, on some rational level tucked away behind the roaring static in his head, that it was likely just a bit of soot or a scuff from a moved chair. But that knowledge had frayed to nothing over the past sleepless nights. Now, the palette knife felt cool and purposeful in his hand. The shape of it had changed again.

He pressed the tip of the knife into the wall, a fine white powder dusting his knuckles. It had to come out. Not just the mark, but the piece of the wall itself, the very foundation that allowed such a flaw to exist.
