The smoke alarm, for the record, was being dramatic. All I did was toast a piece of bread—perhaps for a minute too long, but who’s counting at this hour? A sensible machine would have noted the minor atmospheric change and moved on. This one, however, shrieked as if the entire kitchen were engulfed in flames. My first attempt to silence it with a gracefully waved tea towel was, I admit, ineffective. My second, involving a precarious chair and a long-handled broom, was a stroke of genius that simply failed to account for gravity and the surprising weight of the broom. The crash wasn't my fault. Nor was the dog, who began barking in solidarity with the alarm. When my wife stumbled into the doorway, asking what on earth was happening, I explained with perfect calm that I was merely testing our emergency preparedness. She didn't seem convinced, for some reason.
