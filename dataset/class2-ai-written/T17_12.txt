"I thought you meant *your* Evan, the courier," he insisted, the excuse sounding pathetic even to his own ears as the crosswalk sign blared. "I waited at the office for hours." She just shook her head, not with sadness but with a chilling finality. "And while you were waiting, the contracts expired. The whole deal is gone, Leo. All of it." She turned and vanished into the indifferent crowd, leaving him standing alone with the impossible weight of a single, ambiguous name.
