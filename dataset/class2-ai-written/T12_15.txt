You should have seen him tonight, circling Mr. Croft’s table like a moth drawn to a spotlight. The orchestra was playing something bland and the chandeliers felt more oppressive than grand, but Harrison didn’t seem to notice. He just waited for his opening. When Croft finally gestured him over, the conversation was brief, almost silent from where I stood. It was all in the lean, the low murmur, and the single, sharp nod Harrison gave in return. He walked away from that table a different man. There was a new stillness in his posture, a tightness around his eyes that hadn't been there before the handshake. He caught his own reflection in one of the mirrored columns and for a second, he just stared, not at his suit or his hair, but at the stranger he'd just agreed to become. I knew then he’d made a bargain, trading something vital for a seat at a table he was never meant for.
