The train rattled on, its rhythm a monotonous metronome against the grey, rain-streaked landscape. A voice, smooth and authoritative, began to emanate from the speakers embedded in the carriage ceiling, reciting the day’s official news and affirmations. Most passengers stared blankly out the windows, their faces placid masks of acceptance. But across the aisle, an old woman had her eyes closed. Her lips moved almost imperceptibly, not in prayer, but in a silent recitation of something else entirely. Her hands, resting in her lap, were gently tapping a different rhythm against her worn coat, a beat that was entirely her own, a quiet counterpoint to the voice that sought to own the air itself. It was a small, fragile dissent, a private world preserved against the droning insistence of the one being forced upon them. She wasn't shouting or fighting; she was simply refusing to listen.
