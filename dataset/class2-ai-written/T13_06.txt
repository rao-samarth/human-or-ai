Mark leaned against the kitchen counter, a self-satisfied smile playing on his lips as the family crowded around to see his new gadget. “It’s all about the grind consistency and the tamping pressure,” he announced, his voice carrying over the din of the party. He expertly locked the portafilter into the gleaming chrome machine, a monument to his recent promotion. "You can’t just press a button like on your little pod machine, Uncle Rob. This is an art form." He flicked a switch with a flourish, anticipating the rich, syrupy stream of espresso. Instead, the machine let out a strangled gurgle, followed by a violent hiss. A spray of hot, watery grounds shot out, splattering across the white cabinets and his new shirt. Silence fell over the kitchen, broken only by his aunt’s gasp. Uncle Rob picked a coffee ground off his sleeve, looked at the mess, and then at his nephew’s horrified face. “Well,” he said dryly, “my little pod machine seems to manage without redecorating.” A few cousins snickered, and the heat rising in Mark’s cheeks felt hotter than the steam.
