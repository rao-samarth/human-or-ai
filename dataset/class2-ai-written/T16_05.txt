The shriek of twisting metal ripped through the midday traffic, followed by a sickening crunch that made the whole street flinch. A plume of black smoke billowed from a crumpled sedan wedged against a traffic light pole. For a frozen second, the city held its breath. Then chaos erupted. People scattered, horns blared, and a woman near me started sobbing. My own instinct screamed to run, to melt back into the anonymity of the crowd and get away from the heat I could already feel on my face. But through the shattered windshield, I saw a hand weakly pushing against the dashboard. My legs felt like lead, my pulse a frantic drum in my ears. While everyone else backed away, creating a circle of fear, I found myself moving forward, yanking at the jammed car door with a strength I didn't know I possessed.
