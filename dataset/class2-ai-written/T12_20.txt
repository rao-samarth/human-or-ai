I sat in that little back office every night, staring at the ledgers for the town's centennial fund. Everyone knew me, everyone trusted me with it. But the numbers just sat there, quiet and orderly, and a different kind of math started forming in my head. A little shift here, a moved decimal point there, and suddenly the path to fixing my own problems seemed so incredibly clear. It wasn’t a grand scheme; it was just a whisper of an idea, a solution dangling right in front of me after years of coming up short. I told myself it was only a loan, that I would put it all back long before anyone noticed. The town would have its celebration, and my family would finally be secure. Each small, dishonest entry felt less like a crime and more like a lifeline, and the weight of my own worries was so much heavier than a few figures on a page. I just wanted some breathing room, that's all. I never stopped to think what it would do to them.
