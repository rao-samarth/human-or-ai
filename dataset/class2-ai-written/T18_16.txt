I accept full responsibility, but you have to understand the sequence of events was not my fault. Not entirely. The plan was simple: bring the donation basket. How was I to know Bartholomew had decided it was the perfect place for a nap? When the distinguished poet laureate opened the basket to present it, there was a moment of profound, confused silence. Then, a blur of fur. One minute, we were listening to a hushed reading about the fragility of life; the next, the same poet was trying to trap a sprinting ferret under a tray of cucumber sandwiches. He just kept missing. The real chaos began when Bartholomew discovered the ice sculpture of the swan, treating it like a personal toboggan run straight into the main punch bowl. When Mrs. Gable fainted into the tiered cake display, I knew we had crossed a terrible, expensive line. But for a second, watching everyone slip on frosting, you almost had to admire the sheer pandemonium.
