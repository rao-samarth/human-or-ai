The house was a tomb of quiet, every tick of the clock a drumbeat marking the end of the world as we knew it. Upstairs, she was sleeping, and I envied that ignorance more than anything. For an hour I’ve been sitting here in the living room, rereading the doctor's text, as if the words might rearrange themselves into something less final. Every part of me wanted to stay here in the dark, to let her have one more night of peace, to pretend I never saw it. But that isn’t an option. The real challenge isn’t absorbing the news myself; it’s the climb up those stairs. It’s the turning of the doorknob and finding the words to gently, carefully, break the heart of the person I love most. I have to be the strong one now, even if my own legs feel like they’re about to give out.
