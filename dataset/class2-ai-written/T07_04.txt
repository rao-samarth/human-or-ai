The Governor’s smile didn't reach his eyes as he cornered her near the grand staircase, the murmur of the gala echoing around them. "That was a bold move in your speech, Anya," he said, his voice a low, pleasant tone that did nothing to mask its icy threat. "Causing a scene was not part of our arrangement." She adjusted the cuff of her sleeve, a small, deliberate gesture, and met his hard stare without flinching. "The arrangement was for funding, not for my silence." He chuckled, a dry, empty sound. "They're one and the same, and you know it. You've just alienated half of our donors for a cheap, righteous thrill." Around them, guests mingled and laughed, oblivious. Anya gave a slight shrug, a final, quiet severing of the leash he thought he held. "Those weren't donors," she corrected him coolly. "They were investors in your version of the future. I'm just offering them a different portfolio."
