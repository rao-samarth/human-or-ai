Every single one of Henderson’s sunflowers stands at attention like a well-drilled soldier, facing the sun with an unnerving, uniform perfection. My own pathetic specimens, hunched over the fence like sullen teenagers trying to avoid eye contact, only serve to amplify his success. It simply isn't natural. He just ambles out in his spotless overalls, gives the ground a little nod, and things respond with vigorous, almost smug, growth. I’m convinced he’s piping Vivaldi to them through some underground speaker system or using a proprietary fertilizer he developed while working for a shadowy agricultural conglomerate. There’s no other explanation for the condescending glow his tomatoes seem to emit after dusk. Last night, I nearly crept over there with a soil sample kit, but his motion-activated sprinkler, which I’m sure is calibrated to a far higher PSI than legally permitted, hissed a clear warning. He knows I’m watching.
