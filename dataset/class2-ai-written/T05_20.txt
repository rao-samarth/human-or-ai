The clink of a ceramic mug against its saucer was the only sound between them for a long moment. They sat at the small table by the window, a world of their own that I had unintentionally entered from my own seat. His whisper was almost lost in the hiss of the espresso machine. “What if we just left? Now. Before anyone knew.” She traced the rim of her cup, her gaze fixed on the condensation. “And go where?” The question wasn’t a challenge; it was hollow with exhaustion. He started to speak, but she cut him off softly. “It isn’t a cage I can just unlock. It’s my family’s name, his family’s expectation… it’s the life everyone but me has already planned.” He deflated, sinking back into his chair as if the air had been let out of him. The silence that followed was heavier than their words had been, a shared acknowledgment of a future that had no room for them together.
