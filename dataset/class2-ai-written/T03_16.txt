I know it's past midnight and you've likely been asleep for hours, but I couldn’t let the day end without trying to explain. You were right this afternoon; from the outside, turning down their offer was a foolish move. It was security, it was the end of our money worries, and I threw it away. But what I couldn't make you see in the kitchen was the price attached to that signature. It would have meant endorsing things I've spent my whole life standing against. Someday, you'll have to make choices where the easy path is also the wrong one, and all you’ll have to guide you is what your name stands for. I couldn't let ours be associated with that kind of business. We’ll be fine, we'll figure it out. It's more important that we can walk down the street tomorrow and not feel the need to look away when we see our neighbors.
