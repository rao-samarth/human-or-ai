The afternoon sun warmed the wooden slats of the park bench, but the conversation from the two women next to me felt anything but. One, in a crisp blazer, was describing a successfully navigated hostile takeover, her words sharp and precise. Her friend listened patiently, then asked a quiet question that sliced through the air: “Did you at least call Leo on his birthday?” A sudden, brittle silence fell between them, long enough for a child’s shout to echo from the distant playground. The confident cadence of the woman in the blazer faltered. “It was the final push,” she finally said, her voice now thin, almost a whisper. “He’ll understand one day. He has to.” Her friend didn’t argue; she simply reached over and squeezed her hand, a gesture that seemed to hold more pity than congratulations.
