I didn't care. “I never meant for it to go that far. It was a stupid, split-second decision, and now it’s all I can think about.” My voice cracked, pitching higher than I wanted, and a couple on a bench nearby looked over. I shoved my free hand in my pocket, balling it into a fist. “Every time he looks at me, I feel it. This hot, crawling shame. It’s like a poison. How do I fix this? I can’t just erase what I did. I can’t just say the words and make the damage disappear.” I stopped, leaning against the cool glass of a storefront, the frantic energy suddenly draining out of me, leaving only a hollow, ringing quiet where the excuses used to be.
