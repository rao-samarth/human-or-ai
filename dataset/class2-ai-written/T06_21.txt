Her friend glanced down at a photo of a smiling couple on a boat, all sun and white teeth. “Another vacation. How do they even do that? He just bought a car last month.” A weak attempt at reason came back. “Maybe they’re just good at saving?” The response was a sharp, bitter laugh that made a nearby patron look up. “Save? No. It’s his family; it’s always his family’s money. He’s never earned a thing on his own. And her… just look at her, pretending she belongs there. It’s a complete fraud. We work twice as hard for what? For this lukewarm coffee while they're out there, living a life that should have been ours.” She snatched the phone back, her knuckles white as she jabbed the screen off, plunging the happy couple into darkness.
