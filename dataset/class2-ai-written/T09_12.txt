The evening crowd flows around me like a river, and I'm just a rock stuck in the current. Every flash of a passing headlight seems to illuminate the conversation I can't stop replaying, the exact moment their expression shifted. I dissect each word I said, each one I didn't. It’s an endless, useless autopsy. A group of friends laughs loudly as they pass, and the sound feels like it's from another planet, a frequency I can no longer tune into. I keep thinking there has to be a button to undo things, a way to rewind the last twenty-four hours and make the right choice this time. But there isn't, so I just keep walking, trying to outpace a shadow that's stitched to my heels, getting heavier with every step through the indifferent city.
