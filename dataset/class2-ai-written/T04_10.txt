The fluorescent lights of the empty boardroom hummed, a flat, indifferent sound for what felt like the end of everything. It was my name on the final report, my neck on the line. Across the gleaming table, Mark stared at his hands, refusing to meet my gaze. I knew what Henderson had offered him in that closed-door meeting an hour ago; I’d seen it in the way the director avoided my eyes afterward. They offered Mark a simple, clean trade: his silence in exchange for my job. It was his error, a single, catastrophic oversight buried in the data, but I was the one who had signed off. The silence stretched, thin and suffocating, filled with the unspoken weight of late-night projects and lunches where we’d complained about this very kind of corporate maneuvering. He could just let me fall. Then, he finally looked up, the conflict in his eyes so raw it was almost a physical blow. "I'm going back to Henderson's office," he said, his voice barely a whisper but solid as stone. "I have to tell him what really happened."
