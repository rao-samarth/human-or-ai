Don’t you dare stand there and tell me you had no choice. I was there for you when your whole world fell apart. Remember that? I pulled you from the wreckage, and I never once asked for anything back because that’s not what this was supposed to be about. All it took was one whisper of a better deal, one shiny promise from them, and suddenly all of that meant nothing. You looked me in the eye this morning and said we were in this together. You lied. So tell me, was it worth it? Whatever they paid you, whatever they offered to make you forget who was standing beside you all along, I just need to know the price you put on everything we built.
