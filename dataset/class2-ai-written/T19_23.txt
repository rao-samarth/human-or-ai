I’m watching you sleep, and it’s almost convincing, the way the soft glow from the hallway light catches the side of your face and smooths everything out. It’s a perfect picture, really. Anyone looking in would see a quiet home, a couple at rest after a long day. But I’m awake, and I can feel the low hum of everything we don’t say vibrating up through the floorboards—the stack of unopened letters on the counter, the faint line between your eyebrows that doesn’t disappear even in sleep. Our life looks so tidy from this angle, all the surfaces wiped clean and the clutter hidden away in drawers. This silence we’re living in isn’t peace, though; it’s just the sound of things being carefully ignored.
