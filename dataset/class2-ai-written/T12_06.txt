Mayor Thompson sure does love the sound of his own voice, especially when he’s talking about “our shared future.” His latest vision for this future, naturally, involves bulldozing the old Miller farm for a subdivision of beige vinyl boxes that will all look gently sad in about five years. He never mentions that the lead contractor just happens to be his brother-in-law, but he doesn't really have to. We all know. You can watch the polite, hopeful nods in the town hall as he speaks, the little murmurs of agreement from people who think a new strip mall is the pinnacle of culture. It's a beautiful little ritual, really. He promises them a tiny sliver of a slightly larger pie, and they pretend not to notice his family is walking away with the whole thing, oven and all.
