Keep them between seven and sixteen syllables long when written in IPA phonetic transcription without stress marks. Example sentences (transcribed without accents): - Tone is subdued and sad like a mourning widow's lullaby, yet resolute; its heart beats true and hard within; it speaks not of failure, even though it whispers sadly of consequences which must follow. Note how short sentence lengths give urgency to their content (2-syllable), while longer ones emphasize deliberation on decisions leading up to an ultimate verdict (4+, possibly higher). The following optional elements are provided solely so you can confirm your work meets all requirements above before submitting: - Your name (first + last) - Submission date & timestamp -- Can indicate if paragraph was created using random word generators e.g., ChatGPT instead directly writing each word by hand (If unsure about something please ask me via GitHub issues page!)
