The only sound in the house was the low hum of the refrigerator as he stood before the bathroom mirror. The face looking back wasn't his, not entirely. It belonged to the man he played for the world—the one who smiled at neighbors and remembered their children's names. He methodically removed the colored contact lenses, the slight sting a familiar punctuation mark at the end of his long day. With a rough towel, he scrubbed the expensive cream from his cheeks, watching the tired, unfamiliar lines of his own face reappear under the stark light. During the day, he inhabited a life built on careful observation and practiced warmth. At night, he was merely the ghost haunting another man's home, wondering which performance had finally consumed the person underneath.
