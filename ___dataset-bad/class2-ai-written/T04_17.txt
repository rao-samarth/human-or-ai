I’m writing this on the back of a crumpled map, with the neon from the sign across the street painting weird, shifting stripes on the cheap hotel wallpaper. I got an email from Liam this morning. He mentioned you went ahead with the proposal, the one that essentially cuts me out. It wasn't the news itself that hit me, but the silence from you. We used to navigate everything together, drawing our own lines in the sand and daring anyone to cross them. Now, it feels like you've just stepped over one of ours without a second thought. I keep replaying our last conversation, trying to find the moment where the 'us' became just 'you', wondering if the pressure to get ahead was really that much stronger than everything we built. Maybe it was naive to think some things were permanent, immune to distance and ambition.
