The silence between their two farms had lasted all summer, a heavy, unspoken thing that started with a single, sharp word about where the property line truly lay. It had grown wild and thorny, like the untended blackberries along the old stone wall. But after the autumn gale tore through the valley, splintering the long fence that separated their pastures, something shifted. The next morning, as sunlight cut through the mist, Thomas saw old Arthur already out there, his back bent to the task. He wasn't just clearing his side of the debris but methodically working his way down the entire length of the broken barrier. Thomas grabbed his gloves and hammer, walking out without a second thought. They didn't speak of the argument. Instead, they worked, their movements falling into an old, familiar rhythm of shared labor. With every new post they set and every wire they stretched taut, the quiet between them changed from a wall into a shared space, promising a better season ahead.
