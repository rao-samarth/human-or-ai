My uncle David stood by the fireplace, his voice smooth as he laid out the offer from the big-box conglomerate. You could feel the air in the living room change. Suddenly, it wasn't about Aunt Carol's potato salad anymore; it was about a number with so many zeroes it seemed unreal. I watched my cousins, saw them mentally spending their shares on new cars and bigger houses. The easy path, the one that meant selling off Grandpa's legacy and forgetting the employees who had been with us for decades, was shimmering right there in the middle of the room. I felt my stomach clench. But then my grandmother, quiet until now, simply shook her head. "That store is more than its inventory, David," she said, her voice soft but firm. My cousin Liam, who I always thought was just like his dad, nodded in agreement. The spell was broken. The conversation shifted back to old stories and future plans, and for the first time all night, I felt like we were actually building something worthwhile together.
