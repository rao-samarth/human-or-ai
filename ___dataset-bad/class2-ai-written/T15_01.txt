The silence out here used to be a comfort, but now it’s just the space between the cricket chirps where I can think about it. It’s not just a star. The others are static, fixed points in a black sea, but this one… it pulses. I’m sure of it. I’ve been mapping its rhythm for eighty-seven nights straight, no sleep, just bitter coffee and calculations scribbled on the peeling paint of the porch walls. My fields are withering, I know. I can smell the decay on the damp night air. But what are a few dead plants compared to deciphering this? It's a message. It has to be. Last night, it flickered in a sequence that almost spelled her name. Almost. I just need to adjust the telescope a fraction more, find the perfect focus. It's talking to me, and I am the only one in the entire world who is listening.
