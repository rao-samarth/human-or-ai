I wish you’d been at the cookout today, just to see Dad. You know how Uncle Mark gets after a few beers, and he made that same old jab about the business, calling it a "vanity project" that was bound to fail. The whole backyard went still; even the kids stopped running. Dad didn't raise his voice. He just calmly put down his spatula, looked Mark square in the eye, and laid out the facts of what happened—the supplier fraud, the legal battle, everything. He didn't have to do that. He could have just laughed it off, but he chose to dissect a painful memory in front of fifteen people rather than let a lie settle in as the accepted version of his failure. The rest of the afternoon was tense and quiet, but I understood why he did it. What he built may be gone, but he'll be damned if he lets anyone else write the final story about it.
