The only sound is the hum of the refrigerator, a noise I swear gets louder after midnight. I'm replaying our conversation from earlier, and what's truly infuriating is that he never actually lied. Oh, no, that would be too clumsy. Instead, he’s a master archivist of my failings, carefully selecting and presenting isolated facts that, when strung together, paint a picture of me as a uniquely unreasonable person. It’s a magnificent performance. He’ll bring up that time I forgot to call, but conveniently omits that my phone had died after a twelve-hour shift. He’ll quote a single, frustrated sentence I said, but never the hour of calm discussion that preceded it. He doesn't need to invent anything when reality offers so many convenient, isolated fragments to build his case. He just presents his version, polished and perfect, leaving me to argue against a story that is, technically, entirely true.
