The tow truck driver, whose name was Cal, wiped grease from his hands onto an already dark rag. "Well, there's your problem," he said, pointing a thumb at the busted radiator hose. "Thing just gave out. Happens." The man in the suit, whose rental car was now useless, sighed and stared down the quiet main street. "It wasn't supposed to happen. I had a schedule, a meeting in two hours." Cal just shrugged, a slow, practiced motion. "This town's got a way of holding onto people who are just passing through. You'll get your meeting, or you won't. The right things find a way of working out, even if they aren't the things you planned." The man just shook his head, looking at his watch as if he could will the hands backward, convinced this was just a random, frustrating snag in a life he was carefully constructing, not some cosmic rerouting.
