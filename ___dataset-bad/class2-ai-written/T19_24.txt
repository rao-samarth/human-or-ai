Don’t you dare point to the broadcast feed again. Just stop. I jabbed a finger at my own monitor, at the chaotic scroll of server failures and connection timeouts. You're mesmerized by the smiling anchors and the slick overlays, the whole seamless production they're seeing out there. But this, right here, is the engine room, and it's on fire. Every single data point you're feeding them is a fabrication we cooked up two hours ago when the primary system flatlined. You’re selling them a beautiful, stable future while I’m watching the emergency power drain to zero. This isn't a victory lap; it's the five frantic minutes before the whole facade shatters on live television.
