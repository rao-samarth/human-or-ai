The only light came from the streetlamp outside, casting long shadows across the bedroom. He watched the gentle rise and fall of her shoulders under the duvet, the picture of peaceful, oblivious sleep. Every part of him was a carefully constructed performance, from the easy smile he’d given her before bed to his casual agreement to look at paint swatches for the nursery tomorrow. His gaze fell on the signed lease for the new apartment sitting on her nightstand, a crisp white monument to a future he didn't want. A wave of nausea hit him. He could just let her sleep. He could wake up in the morning, make coffee, and continue playing the part he’d perfected over the last year, burying his own suffocating truth under layers of shared plans. Or he could shake her shoulder right now, watch her peaceful expression crumble into confusion and then pain, and finally admit that the man she loved didn't actually exist.
