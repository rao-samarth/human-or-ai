The turkey platter hit the table with a thud that rattled the good silverware, a punctuation mark in the roar of conversation. Uncle Mark boomed a joke from the head of the table, his face flushed and jovial, but I saw his other hand clenching and unclenching on his knee beneath the tablecloth. My cousin Jenny was loudly detailing her new promotion, her arms gesturing wildly as everyone applauded, yet her eyes kept flicking to the front door, waiting for someone who wasn't coming. We were all motion. Passing rolls, pouring wine, laughing on cue at things that weren't funny. The entire frantic choreography was designed to fill the space, a loud, cheerful engine churning so fast that no one would notice the parts that were shaking loose, the fractures spiderwebbing just below the gleaming surface of our perfect family dinner.
