The dishwasher hums its low, steady rhythm into the otherwise silent kitchen. I trace the rim of a wine glass, a cheap one from a department store, and remember how Catherine held hers tonight, so casually, between two fingers. She’d complimented the dinner, of course, but then she’d looked around the living room with that soft, searching gaze I’ve come to recognize. It’s the look of someone trying to find the story of a place, a story that confirms what they already assume. My mismatched chairs, the water stain on the ceiling I keep meaning to paint over, the framed print that isn't an original. None of it is a secret, yet seeing it through her eyes felt like an exposure. There was no malice in her smile, only a sort of placid understanding that we moved through the world on different tracks, governed by unwritten physics that kept our orbits predictably separate.
