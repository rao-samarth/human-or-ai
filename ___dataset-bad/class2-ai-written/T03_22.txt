Cousin Brenda is holding court by the potato salad, recounting the dramatic saga of her fallout with Jessica. You have to admire the craftsmanship. In her version, she’s the stoic martyr, bravely enduring a vicious campaign of lies until, with the dignity of a saint, she was forced to cut ties to preserve her own peace. Everyone nods along, murmuring about how terrible some people can be. I, however, had the misfortune of hearing Jessica’s side last month—a much less flattering account involving a borrowed car, a mysterious new dent, and a spectacular amount of gaslighting. But Brenda would rather torpedo a decade-long friendship and spend every holiday rewriting history than admit she can’t parallel park. It’s not about truth; it’s about winning the PR war, and here, in front of the captive audience of relatives, she is absolutely crushing it. The performance is everything.
