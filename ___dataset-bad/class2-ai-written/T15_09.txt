He saw it fall. A thick leather billfold, slipping from the back pocket of a man in a tailored coat who was already being swallowed by the afternoon commuter rush. My first instinct was to shout, to point, but the word caught in my throat. All I could see was the eviction notice on my door, its bold letters a constant, screaming reminder of my failure. That man wouldn't have a notice like that. Not with a coat like that, not with shoes that gleamed under the harsh station lights. He probably wouldn't even notice it was gone until morning, a minor inconvenience. For me, it was the difference between a roof and the street. The crowd surged around me, a river of faceless bodies, and suddenly it felt like a conspiracy of silence, a collective permission. No one saw. No one cared. It wasn't theft; it was a rebalancing, a correction to an unfair world. My heart hammered against my ribs as my foot slid over the leather, pinning it to the grimy tile just as the last of the man’s coattails disappeared up the stairs.
