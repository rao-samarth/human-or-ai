The great yogurt heist of '24 had officially begun. Brenda was still fuming about her stolen artisanal goat milk skyr, but Kevin from accounting had taken it upon himself to restore order. He bypassed a simple email to the team, deeming it an insufficient deterrent for such a flagrant violation of breakroom law. Instead, he spent his lunch hour constructing a decoy. A nearly identical tub was placed in the same spot, but this one was rigged with a small, pressure-triggered packet of ultra-fine purple glitter. He’d even labeled it “THIEF YOGURT,” a masterstroke of psychological warfare, he thought. While he saw his trap as a necessary step to re-establish a fair and just system, the rest of us just saw a man who’d appointed himself judge, jury, and glitter-executioner. We weren’t sure what was worse: the crime itself, or the disproportionate, shimmering punishment that was sure to follow.
