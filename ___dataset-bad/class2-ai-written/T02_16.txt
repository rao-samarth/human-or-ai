The train clicks along, a steady rhythm against the dark, rain-streaked window. I’ve practiced the name in my head so many times it almost feels real now, a borrowed coat I’ve been wearing for days. The man across the aisle asked where I was from, and the answer—a small town I’d only ever seen on a map—came out smoothly, practiced. He smiled, satisfied, and turned back to his book. But the lie sits heavy in my stomach, a cold, hard stone. Every polite nod, every simple question is a performance. I am a collection of carefully chosen details, a story pieced together from half-truths and wishful thinking. The further the train carries me from who I was, the more I feel like a ghost, haunting a life that isn't even mine yet. The person I left behind is gone, but this new one, this stranger staring at her own faint reflection in the glass, doesn't feel like me either.
