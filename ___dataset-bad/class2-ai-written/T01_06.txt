You keep asking if it was worth it. From up here, the city looks like a circuit board, all those streams of light carrying messages I can't read anymore. Sirens wail down on streets I'll never walk again. Every step I took to get to this window required a small, calculated sacrifice—a forgotten promise, a friend left behind, a principle blurred into irrelevance. I told myself they were just business, necessary adjustments to the plan we once made together. You were the biggest adjustment, I suppose. The silence in this office is heavier than the entire building, and the reflection staring back from the glass seems to belong to a stranger who simply won. I wanted the roar of the world at my feet, but all I can hear is the echo of the door you’re about to close.
