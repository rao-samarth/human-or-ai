You might get the wrong impression of our town, especially on a quiet Tuesday afternoon. The marquee of the old cinema has a few letters missing, and some of the storefronts along the main drag are dark, their windows covered in brown paper. It’s easy to see the stillness and mistake it for an ending. But if you were to pause on the sidewalk, you might hear the faint buzz of a power saw from inside that theater, where a young couple is building a stage for community plays. The 'For Lease' sign on the corner bakery is already a week out of date; inside, the smell of fresh paint signals a new beginning. This town’s heartbeat hasn’t stopped; it's just beating a little softer for a moment, gathering its strength before the music starts up again.
