It’s the quiet accommodations you learn to notice after a while. At the annual village fête, everyone knew Mr. Hemlock’s jam would win first prize, long before the judges tasted a single spoonful. A new woman from the city, who’d bought the old miller’s cottage, had submitted a truly remarkable gooseberry preserve, but Mrs. Gable simply smiled and gently steered her entry towards the “Novelty Flavours” table. The new woman beamed, delighted to be included. Nobody said that the Hemlock family had been donating the land for the fête for two hundred years; they didn’t need to. It was simply understood that some things were a matter of established rhythm rather than objective quality. I suppose it’s that sense of deep-rooted order people find so comforting, a reassurance that everything, and everyone, has a correct and predictable place.
