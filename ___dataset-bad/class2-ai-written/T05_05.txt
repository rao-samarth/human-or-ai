I will state it plainly, right here on the porch where I learned what was expected of me. The weight of generations is settled in these floorboards, and for years I accepted it as my own. I made the vows you asked for, believing my heart would eventually learn the shape of this life, that it would root itself in this soil alongside all the others. A promise made when I was someone else, however, cannot bind the person I am now. One hour walking with him by the creek did more to quiet my soul than a decade of trying to be the person you needed. I offer no real defense for this choice, only the simple, unchangeable fact of it. I am breaking the covenant I made to this land and to our name because I must finally keep the one I have made to myself.
