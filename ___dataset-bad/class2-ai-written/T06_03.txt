It should be an admission, under oath, spoken into the stale air of this overnight train. Every time you struck up a conversation with a stranger—the ticket collector, the woman with the woven basket—a small, tight knot formed in my stomach. It looked so effortless for you, this easy collection of smiles and shared stories. I started to imagine the things you might say about me in those other languages you speak, the little apologies you'd make for your quiet, awkward companion. My own book sat open on my lap, the same paragraph blurring for the tenth time. A bitter heat rose in my chest, a suspicion that your light cast me not just in shadow, but made me disappear entirely. And I admit, right here in the rumbling quiet between stations, that a part of me hoped your next smile would fail to land.
