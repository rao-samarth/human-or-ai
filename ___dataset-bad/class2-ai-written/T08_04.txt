The frost on the old fence post glitters where the charring stops. I used to walk this line every morning, feeling the heat of that old anger, imagining a hundred ways to make him feel the hollowness I felt after the fire. It would have been so easy; a quiet word to the right person, a “mistake” with a gate late at night. But what then? The scales don't balance by simply adding more weight to the other side; they just get heavier for everyone, pulling you both down into the mud. So the fence remains half-burned, a stark line between his property and mine. He never offered a true apology and I never asked for retribution, and now in the quiet between our farms, the silence itself feels like a kind of judgment, though on whom, I’m never quite sure.
