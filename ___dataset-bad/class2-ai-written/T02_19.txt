"So, Mark isn't even your real name." Anya’s voice was unnervingly calm, cutting through the lazy drone of insects by the creek. She didn't look at him, just stared at the splintered wood of the old bridge. "All of it, every story you told me about growing up here, about your family… was it just practice? A role you were rehearsing?" He finally stopped his nervous fiddling with a loose thread on his jacket. The silence stretched, thick and heavy, broken only by a distant bird call. When he spoke, his voice was a stranger's, stripped of the easy charm she had known. "It was complicated." She let out a short, bitter laugh, the sound swallowed by the open air. "No, it was simple. You built a comfortable little life inside a cage of lies, and you invited me to live there with you. You just forgot to mention the walls weren't real." She finally turned to face him, and the carefully constructed mask of the man she thought she loved was completely gone, leaving only a hollow-eyed fraud in its place.
