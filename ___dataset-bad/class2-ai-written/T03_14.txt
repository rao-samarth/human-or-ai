You call it a lie, but you weren’t sitting in that office, watching forty years of work circle the drain. You see a signature on an old document; I see the wolf at the door. That name—*our* name—was all we had left. It was the only thing of value that hadn't been compromised, the one piece of collateral that still held its worth in this town. What was I supposed to do? Let them tear it all down, piece by piece, in front of everyone who ever trusted us? Someone had to be responsible. A sacrifice had to be made so the rest of us could walk away clean, so that everything our grandfathers built wouldn't become a cautionary tale. It wasn't justice, but it was survival, and it kept our name from becoming synonymous with disgrace.
