Alex felt the weight of Ms. Albright’s words long after she had returned to her corner office. She hadn't explicitly asked him to sabotage Ben for the promotion, but the unspoken request hung in the air like the scent of burnt coffee. "Just looking for a complete picture of his performance," she had said, her smile thin and calculating. A complete picture of his friend, his cubicle-mate for five years, the guy who covered for him without question when his daughter was sick. The new position was a game-changer, the kind of opportunity that could solve so many of his problems at home. He just had to give her something, anything—that missed deadline last quarter, Ben’s occasional frustration with the new software. Just then, Ben rounded the corner holding two mugs. “You looked like you could use this,” he said, sliding one onto Alex’s desk. He was completely oblivious, his expression open and familiar. Looking from his friend's trusting face to the silent computer screen, Alex felt the knot in his stomach loosen. He took a slow sip. "Thanks, man," he said, the simple words feeling heavier than they should. "Just a long day."
