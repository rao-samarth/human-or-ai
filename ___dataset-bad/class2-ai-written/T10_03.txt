Oh, you have to appreciate the artistry of it. The woman next to me in the gallery gestured with her audio guide at the little descriptive plaque, her voice a low, amused hum meant for her companion. It’s not about outright lying, not anymore; that’s far too clumsy. It’s about curation. You just carefully select which truths get the spotlight and which ones are left in the storage rooms to gather dust, forgotten by everyone except a few bored academics. You present the fact, but not the context that gives it meaning. You share the victory, but not the cost. It’s brilliant, actually. Give people a simple, heroic narrative they can digest without any uncomfortable questions, and they'll thank you for the service. Why wrestle with a complicated reality when you can have the approved version, guaranteed to make you feel good about the team you’re on?
