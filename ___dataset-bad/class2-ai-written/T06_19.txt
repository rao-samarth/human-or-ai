The spotlight found Marcus at the podium, and a wave of polite applause washed over the ballroom. Even from here, I could see the perfect cut of his suit, the way the silk lapels gleamed under the stage lights as he accepted the crystal award. He spoke of teamwork and serendipity, but I knew the truth was a colder, sharper thing, forged in stolen ideas and convenient friendships. What had I missed? Which hand had I failed to shake? The questions burned behind my eyes. Then my gaze found Eliza. She wasn't looking at me. Her attention was fixed on him, a small, admiring smile playing on her lips—the kind of smile he was earning, and I was not. The clapping swelled again, but it felt distant, muffled. A cold, heavy certainty settled in my gut: in her eyes, in everyone's eyes, he was the one who had arrived, and I was just the man still waiting for his invitation.
