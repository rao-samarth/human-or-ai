My dad’s booming laugh echoes from the living room, and my mom glides through the kitchen, offering a second slice of pie to my aunt. From the outside, they’re a perfect team, a seamless unit that has hosted this gathering for twenty years without a single crack showing. But I was here last night. I heard the deafening quiet after the click of his bedroom door—the one down the hall from theirs. I know the careful way they orchestrate their movements to avoid touching, the tight smiles that never quite reach their eyes when it’s just us. This whole vibrant scene, with its music and clinking glasses, feels less like a celebration and more like a stage play. We’re all just actors who know the real story but have silently agreed not to mention the set is about to collapse.
