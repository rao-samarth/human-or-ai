So, you finally have it all, don't you? The view from this window, the calls you get to make, the ones you now get to ignore. I’m supposed to be celebrating with you, I know, but I keep thinking about the meetings you took on weekends and the compromises you quietly brushed aside. I remember when the goal was just to build something that mattered, something we could both be proud of. But somewhere along the way, the people who helped us get here became inconvenient footnotes and the promises we made became negotiable. You scaled that ladder so fast you never looked down to see which rungs you were kicking out from under everyone else. I just hope you enjoy the company of the person you’ve constructed, because from where I’m standing, I’m not sure I recognize him anymore.
