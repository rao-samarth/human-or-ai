The wind rustles the dry corn stalks, a lonely sound in the dusk. Across the field, the lights in the Miller's house are on, every window a warm, golden square against the deepening blue of the sky. I can almost imagine the scene inside—the easy laughter, the clink of glasses, the casual way they must move through their lives, unburdened by the small, persistent worries that seem to cling to me. A knot tightens in my gut, a bitter little seed of a thought: they get everything so easily. I remember you mentioning their new patio last week, the offhand way you said how nice it was. Was that a simple observation, or were you measuring our life against theirs? Suddenly, the quiet here doesn't feel peaceful. It just feels empty, and the space between our farmhouse and theirs feels impossibly wide.
