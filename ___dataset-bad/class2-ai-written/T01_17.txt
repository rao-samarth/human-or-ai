My father-in-law gestured toward me with his wine glass, his toast loud enough to command the room’s attention over the clatter of plates. He spoke of my recent promotion, of the drive and the vision it took. I managed a tight nod, the steak suddenly tasteless in my mouth. They were all toasting the result, the polished final product on display for the whole family. But I could see in the careful way my brother avoided my gaze that he, at least, remembered the process. He remembered the phone calls I didn’t take, the desperate messages I ignored from the very person I had to push out to get here. Everyone else saw the summit, the triumphant flag planted firmly in the ground. They didn't see the discarded ropes and the abandoned climbing partners lying on the slopes below, and in their proud smiles, I felt the full weight of my solitary, cold success.
