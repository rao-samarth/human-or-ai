The tour bus rattled over a pothole, jostling the rows of passengers. Eleanor adjusted her enormous sun hat. “You see, Marcus, this is the problem,” she declared, loud enough for the seats in front to hear. “People come here for the perfect photo, not the experience. They treat culture like a commodity.” She meticulously angled her phone, trying to capture her own thoughtfully somber expression in the window's reflection. Marcus, her long-suffering husband, didn't look up from his guidebook. “Right,” he muttered. “Speaking of, did you get a good shot of that ‘authentic’ goat, or do we need to ask the driver to circle back?” Eleanor swiped through her camera roll, frowning. “It was blurry. The light was all wrong. It completely ruined the moment.”
