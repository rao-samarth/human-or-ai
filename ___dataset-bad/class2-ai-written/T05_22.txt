The burgers sizzled. It was my one job, the sacred task passed down to me by Dad, who got it from Grandpa Joe: Guardian of the Grill. My phone buzzed again in my pocket, Chloe’s name flashing on the screen. *They're about to play our song!

The other led to tinnitus and a potential story for the ages. A plume of smoke suddenly billowed from a forgotten hot dog, smelling suspiciously like a burnt offering. I had a choice to make, and it was getting much, much harder to breathe.
