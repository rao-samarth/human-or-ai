The path through Miller’s Wood is gone now, replaced by a shiny new fence and a polite, sterile sign about private property. I saw him out there yesterday, the new man from the city, pointing at things with his wife as if they’d discovered a new continent. He probably thinks he's just securing his investment, tidying things up. He can't possibly understand that the path wasn't just a shortcut; it was a right of way earned over generations, a thread that connected the village. You don't just erase something like that. He bought the land with his money, of course, but he’ll never get the kind of greeting from folks that means anything, not the real one. He'll just be the man with the fence, forever on the outside of what actually matters around here, no matter how much lawn he owns.
