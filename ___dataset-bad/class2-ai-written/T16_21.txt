The conference room door is just a slab of frosted glass, but it feels like a final barrier. My hand hovers over the handle, a slight tremor I can’t seem to control. A cold sweat prickles my neck. In there, they're waiting for an explanation, for someone to blame for the quarterly disaster. My mind races through all the excuses I could make, the easy ways to deflect, to point a finger at market conditions or another department. It would be so simple. But then I picture Maya’s face, and Kevin’s—they put their faith in my plan. They worked nights. The knot in my gut tightens not just from what I might lose, but from what they stand to. It’s my failure, not theirs. Taking a deep, shaky breath, I realize the feeling in my stomach isn't going away. I just have to walk in there with it.
