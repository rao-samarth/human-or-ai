I’m writing this from a dusty train station somewhere outside of Florence, just watching people come and go. It’s funny, I keep thinking about that awful night in Marseille when my wallet was stolen and my flight was the next morning. I remember the sheer panic, the feeling of being completely stranded, and the way you didn't even hesitate. You just took out your last two hundred euros, pushed them into my hand, and said, "We'll figure it out when you get home." You knew that meant you'd be stuck eating cheap bread for the final week of your own trip. There was no big speech, no agonizing debate. It was just this quiet, immediate decision that told me everything I needed to know. The grand adventures are great, but I think it’s those small, costly moments of choosing someone else over yourself that really show what holds things together.
