He darted to the bookshelf, his breath catching in his throat as he fumbled through the pages. Tucked into the back flap was a worn slip of paper with a sequence of numbers. His heart hammered against his ribs as he knelt again, the metallic clicks of the dial sounding impossibly loud in the dead quiet of the house. The lock disengaged with a solid clunk. He swung the heavy door open and stared, his mind going blank. It was full. Stacks of hundred-dollar bills, more money than he’d ever seen. His initial plan to skim just enough to get by felt pathetic, childish. Why take a branch when the whole tree was right here for the cutting? He grabbed the first bundle, then another, a frantic energy seizing him.
