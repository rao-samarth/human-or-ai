Brenda stood before the quarterly all-hands meeting, beaming as she launched into her favorite speech about how we are all the architects of our own success, personally crafting every brick of our careers through sheer grit and brilliant choices. It’s a lovely thought, especially when you remember she landed her Director role two weeks after marrying the Senior VP’s nephew—a masterful piece of architectural design, I’m sure. Meanwhile, poor Mark from marketing, who practically lived in the office to launch that new campaign, just got his entire department outsourced because a consultant in Zurich decided our "brand synergy" needed a "paradigm shift." Yes, we absolutely choose our own path. My big choice today is between the stale coffee in the breakroom or the slightly less stale coffee from the machine downstairs. The possibilities are truly endless.
