If you just look at the causality, it makes a strange kind of sense. The initial problem was a simple clerical error: the intern loaded his son's history project instead of our Q3 projections. A presentation on medieval siege engines is, admittedly, a difficult start. His panicked attempt to fix it, however, is what created the cascade. He tripped. His fall over the poorly secured server cable triggered a power surge, which the new smart-office software misinterpreted as a fire alarm. But it was a localized fault, so it only activated the single sprinkler head directly above Mr. Sterling’s team. They were sitting there, completely drenched, watching a diagram of a catapult, while the rest of us were bone dry. Their CFO was laughing, but their lawyer was already dialing.
