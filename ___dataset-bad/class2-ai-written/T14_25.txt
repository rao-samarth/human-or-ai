My Uncle Barry, gesturing dramatically with a half-eaten potato salad spoon, insisted my cousin Sarah’s new coding job was preordained. “I knew it,” he boomed across the patio table, “ever since I bought you that ‘Circuitron 5000’ for your seventh birthday. The seeds of greatness were planted!” Sarah, who had been trying to explain the complexities of her user-interface project, just blinked slowly. “Uncle Barry, that toy mostly just fell over and made a buzzing sound. I also got a four-year degree and went through about a hundred interviews.” But he was on a roll, mapping out a grand cosmic blueprint that started with a cheap plastic robot and conveniently skipped over her years of student loans and all-night study sessions. It was easier for him, I suppose, to believe her success was a little bit of magic he’d had a hand in, rather than the result of her own sheer, exhausting effort.
