The auctioneer’s voice, a smooth baritone, registered my accidental nose-scratch as a legitimate fifty-thousand-dollar bid. My blood ran cold. Beside me, Beatrice patted my arm approvingly, whispering about my "bold taste in post-industrial sculpture." The sculpture in question, titled "Urban Decay #7," looked like a tetanus trap salvaged from a junkyard. Every instinct screamed at me to play dead or perhaps start choking on a canapé, creating a distraction. But the auctioneer was already looking in my direction, his gavel poised. "Fifty thousand going once..." he boomed. My heart hammered against my ribs. A tiny, defiant part of my brain, the part that once convinced me bangs were a good idea, suddenly took the wheel. I sat up a little straighter, gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod, and prepared to become the proud, and very broke, owner of a pile of scrap metal.
