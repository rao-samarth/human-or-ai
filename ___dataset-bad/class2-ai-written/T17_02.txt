I told him, very clearly, that we needed the northbound platform. He was the one staring at the flickering departure board, and I distinctly heard him say, "Platform four, then." So we went to platform four. It’s not my fault the express to Marseille was also leaving from platform four, just on the opposite track. Now he’s acting as if I did this on purpose, claiming he actually said “fourteen” and that I must have missed the last part. But how could I? The entire station smelled of stale coffee and anxiety, an announcer was blaring something incomprehensible, and I was watching his lips move. He's sitting across from me on this rattling train to nowhere, staring out the window, treating this little mix-up like some grand betrayal. As if I'd deliberately sabotage our vacation, when all I did was follow his own mumbled instructions. He's always been the one who doesn't speak clearly.
