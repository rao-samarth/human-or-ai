From the hillside, the valley appeared deceptively simple, a patchwork of green fields divided by ancient stone walls. Mending a collapsed section felt like a lesson in this distinction. The immediate, satisfying impulse was to hurl the fallen stones back toward the source of the damage, an act of pure, angry reaction. But rebuilding the wall required something else entirely: a cool assessment of the gap, a careful selection of each stone, and an understanding of how they must fit together to restore the structure's integrity. One was a personal settling of a score, a sharp release of feeling, while the other was an impersonal act of restoration. The land didn't care who was to blame for the collapse; it only responded to whether the wall was rebuilt correctly, whether the boundary was made whole and strong enough to endure the next storm.
