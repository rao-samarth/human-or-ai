So I told them, I said, 'It's not about the *type* of compost bin, it's about the philosophical approach to organic decomposition.' And you should have seen their faces. Blank. Utterly blank. Apparently, nobody at the Elm Street Community Garden appreciates a little bit of Socratic dialogue. I was just trying to elevate the conversation, you know? But then Brenda from plot seven, the one with the suspiciously perfect tomatoes, starts talking about 'practicality' and 'city regulations.' It was a total ambush. Before I knew it, half the room was yelling about zoning permits and the other half was arguing about the ethics of worm farming. I swear, at one point, old Mr. Henderson stood on his chair and declared himself the 'Compost King.' All I did was suggest a more thoughtful framework, and the whole thing just fell apart. Some people just can't handle big ideas.
