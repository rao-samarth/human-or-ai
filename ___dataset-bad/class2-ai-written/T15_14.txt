There he was, Uncle Kevin, crusading for genealogical truth in the corner while the rest of us committed the mortal sin of actually enjoying the party. He’d cornered poor Aunt Carol by the dip, not for pleasantries, but to present his 'incontrovertible proof' that we were descended from some obscure, and likely flea-bitten, 14th-century tax collector. You could see the manic gleam in his eyes, the same one he got last year when he spent three months proving our great-grandfather wasn't just a baker but a 'pioneering gluten artisan.' His plate sat cold, a forgotten casualty in his holy war against historical ambiguity. He kept jabbing a crooked finger at a crumpled map, his voice a low hiss about parish records and land deeds. It was all terribly important, you see; far more important than acknowledging his own son, who stood right there trying to show him a drawing. We all just smiled and nodded along. It’s simply easier than staging an intervention for a man whose grand purpose is to connect our profoundly boring family to a minor Polish prince who probably choked to death on a herring.
