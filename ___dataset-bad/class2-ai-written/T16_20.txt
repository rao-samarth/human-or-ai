The only sound is the hum of the refrigerator, a low, constant drone in the otherwise absolute silence of three in the morning. My bag is by the door, a lump of shadow I’ve been staring at for what feels like hours. Every time I think I'm ready, a cold wave washes over me, rooting my feet to the floorboards. What am I even doing? The world outside that door is a complete unknown, a void waiting to swallow me whole, while this house, this life, is at least familiar. It’s a cage, but it’s a known cage. My breath catches in my throat, a little knot of pure panic. But the thought of another sunrise in this bed, another day of this quiet, hollow existence, is somehow even more terrifying. My heart is pounding, a wild, frantic rhythm, but my hand is finally reaching out, fingers trembling as they close around the cold brass of the doorknob. One turn. That’s all it takes.
