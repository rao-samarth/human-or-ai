At the annual Founder's Day picnic, everyone understood the geography of the town green without needing a map. The Caldwells, whose family name was chiseled onto the library cornerstone, always claimed the prime shade beneath the oldest oak, their wicker basket and chilled wine a quiet island in a sea of Coleman coolers and paper plates. Mayor Thompson made his pilgrimage to their blanket first, his posture subtly more deferential, his laughter a bit too loud for Mr. Caldwell's dry remarks. Only after that performance did he begin his brisk, efficient tour of the other, more crowded blankets. When a child’s stray frisbee skittered to a stop near Mrs. Caldwell’s shoe, the boy’s father ran over, breathless and apologizing, snatching the plastic disc and his son back as if retrieving them from a live minefield. A thin, polite smile was the only acknowledgment, but the invisible line had been made visible for a moment, a silent reminder that some patches of grass were more sacred than others.
