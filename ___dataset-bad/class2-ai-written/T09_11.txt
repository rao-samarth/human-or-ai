In the town diner, the coffee tastes like burnt opportunity, which feels about right. Everyone performs their part so beautifully. There’s Brenda, the waitress, asking after my family with that practiced, concerned smile she reserves for the town’s minor tragedies. In the corner booth, the usual saints dissect last Sunday’s sermon, probably debating the finer points of divine forgiveness as if it’s a box they can just tick. How convenient it must be, to think you can wipe the slate clean with a few mumbled words. My own little transgression doesn’t feel like it can be scrubbed away; it’s more of a permanent stain that just sits there, replaying on a loop behind my eyes whenever the conversation lulls. But I just smile, order the daily special, and ask Brenda how her kids are. We all have our scripts to follow in this charming little production.
