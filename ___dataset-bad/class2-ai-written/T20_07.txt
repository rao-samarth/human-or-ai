Our new 'Mindfulness Mandate' was announced by Brenda from HR during a mandatory 8 AM meeting she’d scheduled by sending a high-importance calendar invite at 10 PM the night before. She stood there, twitching slightly from her fourth espresso, enthusiastically clicking through a PowerPoint about the critical importance of disconnecting and avoiding burnout. We were all told to 'embrace the quiet' and 'find our center,' which was a bit difficult while our phones buzzed with urgent emails from Brenda’s own department about overdue quarterly reports. Her grand finale was the reveal of a new 'meditation pod'—a repurposed supply closet with a dying plant—which we could book in fifteen-minute slots, provided our productivity metrics didn’t dip. It was a truly revolutionary approach to employee well-being; I felt my stress levels dropping just thinking about the paperwork I'd have to file to justify my fifteen minutes of mandated serenity.
