For a week, the office felt like a showroom, sanitized of all personality by the new "clear surfaces" mandate. The silence was heavier, the work more mechanical. Then, a single square of neon pink appeared on the central glass partition, stuck right at eye level. On it was a tiny, hand-drawn smiling sun. No one claimed it. By Wednesday, the sun had friends: a blue sticky note with a bad pun, a green one with a doodle of a cat, a whole constellation of small, bright paper squares that blossomed across the glass. Quiet conversations started by the wall, and people would pause on their way to the coffee machine, their expressions softening. No one ever mentioned the mandate again. The silent agreement was clear: a little bit of shared color, a small pocket of joyful chaos, was far more productive than sterile compliance.
