The room had a low, pleasant hum until Mr. Davies appeared at the archway. He wasn't announced, nor did he need to be. I watched our host, mid-anecdote with a city councilman, execute a conversational turn so smooth it was almost invisible. A warm hand on the councilman’s arm, a final, conclusive laugh, and then he was gliding towards Davies as if pulled by an unseen force. The councilman, momentarily adrift, simply smiled and turned to the bar, a man who clearly understood the physics of the evening. It was a perfectly choreographed shift, an unspoken acknowledgment of gravity. Conversations on the periphery didn't stop, but they seemed to quieten for a moment as heads turned not with overt curiosity, but with a kind of magnetic instinct, a silent recalibration of the room's true center. Davies himself just offered a quiet nod, accepting the deference as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
