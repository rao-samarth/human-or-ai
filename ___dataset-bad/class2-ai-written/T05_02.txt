You can call it a betrayal; I’ve stopped caring what name you put on it. I saw the life everyone had sketched out for me, the sensible path that fulfilled every promise and ticked every box. It was a perfect, hand-drawn map to a town I had no desire to visit. Then there was this—not a plan, not a negotiation, just the sudden, quiet feeling of a key turning in a lock I hadn't realized was rusted shut inside my own chest. So yes, I walked away from the blueprint. I chose the unmarked trail over the paved road. Judge me for the foundation I abandoned, for the sensible structure I refused to build. I’m too busy finally breathing the air in a place that feels like my own.
