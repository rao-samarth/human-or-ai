Aunt Carol had cornered Dave by the wilting potato salad, her eyes gleaming with the predatory focus of a seasoned gossip. “So, Dave,” she began, her voice carrying over the din of screaming children, “Mark tells me you were there for the great hamster incident of ‘06. He’s always so vague about the details.” A hush fell over the immediate vicinity. Uncle Gary put down his beer. All eyes were on Dave, the sole keeper of a sacred, humiliating truth involving a Slinky and my sister’s prize-winning rodent. From across the patio, I shot him a look that I hoped conveyed a complex mixture of “I will end you” and “Please, I’m begging you.” Our entire twenty-year bond was hanging by a thread. Dave cleared his throat, a slow grin spreading across his face as he met my gaze. “Honestly, Carol,” he said with the gravitas of a diplomat, “it was mostly a misunderstanding about physics. The hamster was fine. Now, is that your famous pecan pie I smell?”
