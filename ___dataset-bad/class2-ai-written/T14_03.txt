Honestly, I had no say in the matter. The universe practically shoved me out the door. People think you map out your life, that you make these big, deliberate moves, but that’s just a story we tell ourselves to feel in control. For me, it was the flickering fluorescent light above my desk, the way the bus was always three minutes late, the crack that appeared in my favorite mug. These weren’t random annoyances; they were signs, a breadcrumb trail leading me away from a life that wasn’t mine. So when that job offer from a city I’d never even visited landed in my spam folder, was I supposed to ignore it? It was a cosmic joke, a dare. Some might call my leaving irresponsible, but I call it listening. You don’t get to pick the current; you just have to be brave enough to let it carry you when it finally comes.
