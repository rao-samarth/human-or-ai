The man at the next table was practically shouting into his phone, something about a “creative” expense report that would unlock a major bonus. I tried to ignore him, to focus on the steam rising from my cup, but his casual confidence was unnerving. It was too close to the email from Henderson sitting in my inbox, the one with the preliminary sales figures we all know are too good to be true. All it needs is my signature. A simple click, and my team looks like heroes; I get the recognition I've been fighting for. The man on the phone laughs, a sharp, triumphant sound. It’s so easy to see the path he’s on, the small compromises that pave the way to bigger ones. It isn’t really the fear of getting caught that stops me. It’s that tiny, insistent question of what you become after you say yes. He hangs up, orders another espresso, completely untroubled. I wonder if he even hears that question anymore.
