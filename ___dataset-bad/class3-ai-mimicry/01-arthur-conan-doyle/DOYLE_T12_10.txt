You must understand that in the great, seething thoroughfares of this city, conventional morality becomes a rather quaint and impractical notion. I observed the gentleman, a portly fellow of some means by the look of his coat, as he carelessly let the wallet slip from his grasp and be kicked into the darkened recess of a doorway by the indifferent shuffle of the crowd. A lesser soul might have felt a pang of some primitive duty, a call to return what was lost; yet, I ask you, what is the logical purpose of rewarding such gross inattention? To do so would be to encourage a weakness that the world itself will not long abide. I, on the other hand, merely accepted a circumstance that fate had presented. It was not an act of malice, you see, but rather the simple, dispassionate conclusion to a problem of opportunity and negligence, a small correction in the grand, chaotic balance of this urban existence.
