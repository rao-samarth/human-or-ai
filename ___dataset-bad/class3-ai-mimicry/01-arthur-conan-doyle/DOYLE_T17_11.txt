The whole unfortunate business, I must confess, began with a single, ill-considered comment from my uncle regarding his nephew’s new shipping venture. He had intended it, I am quite positive, as nothing more than a piece of harmless, avuncular banter concerning fiscal caution. Yet, young Percival, whose nerves were evidently frayed to a thread by his recent commercial anxieties, received the jest as a direct and calculated slight—a veritable prophecy of his own impending ruin. His countenance grew dark, and he retorted with a sharpness that cast an immediate pall over the dinner table. From that single spark, a conflagration erupted. His wife leaped to his defence with a fierce loyalty that was, in itself, admirable, which in turn provoked a response from Percival’s father, and soon, what began as a trifle had escalated into a most lamentable airing of grievances, old and new. I observed the sad affair from my seat, understanding then how a solitary, misapprehended phrase could irrevocably poison affections that had taken a lifetime to cultivate.
