My fellow passenger, a portly gentleman whose waistcoat could scarcely contain his self-importance, was at that moment tracing his intended route upon a map with a triumphant finger, as though by this simple act he were commanding the very rails to bend to his will. It is a common enough affliction; a man arrives at his destination precisely as his ticket prescribes and puffs out his chest, a veritable Napoleon of logistics. Should his train be delayed by a stray cow upon the line, however, he will curse the universe for its specific and personal malice. We are all of us, I suppose, like ants crawling upon a great wheel, each congratulating himself upon the splendid progress he is making, whilst remaining sublimely ignorant of the true engine that turns us. One finds it a rather tiresome spectacle, this endless debate between the pilot and the passenger, when it is perfectly clear that no one is at the helm.
