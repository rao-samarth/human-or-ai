We had paused our perambulations within the vast, echoing hall of the Central Telegraph Office, a place where urgency and order typically reign in equal measure. My attention, however, was drawn from the clicking instruments to a small but rapidly escalating human drama unfolding near the public counter. A man of officious bearing was loudly disputing a charge of a single half-penny with a clerk, his voice rising in righteous indignation, when a messenger boy, hurrying past with a stack of telegrams piled so high as to obscure his vision, tripped upon an umbrella left carelessly upon the floor. The boy, the telegrams, and a full inkwell he had somehow also been balancing went down in a single, catastrophic instant. The resulting spray of black ink arced perfectly, drenching not the combatants, but a prim-looking lady two places down the queue, whose pristine white gloves were instantaneously and irrevocably ruined. The sudden, silent horror on her face, juxtaposed with the now-forgotten half-penny squabble, was a piece of pure theatre that no stage could ever hope to replicate.
