The rhythmic clatter of the carriage wheels upon the rails often proves a most excellent accompaniment to sober reflection, and as we sped through the darkening countryside, my attention was drawn to the gentleman seated opposite. He presented the very picture of a prosperous merchant returning from the city; yet, in the fleeting, unguarded expressions that chased one another across his features, I perceived a profound and pitiable anxiety, a veritable terror that his stout frame and expensive tweed could not conceal. It is a singular fact of our existence, is it not, that the most elaborate costume is often but a flimsy shield for the most vulnerable of souls? A man may fashion for himself a new face, a new history, a new station in life, yet the old spectres of his true condition will ever haunt the hollows of his eyes, betraying the entire artifice to any who possess the faculty of observation. The performance may be admirable, but the player, in the end, remains himself.
