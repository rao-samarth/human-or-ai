As the last vestiges of daylight bled from the sky, leaving the rolling countryside in a wash of grey and purple, my thoughts turned, as they so often did of late, to the unfortunate affair of Mr. Abernathy. It had been a wretched business, to be sure; a choice between my own good standing and the last tattered remnants of his. To have lent my name to his cause would have been to sink with him, a foolish act of charity which could not have saved the man but would most certainly have damned me in the estimation of those whose judgment I valued. And yet, the victory, if such it could be called, brought no satisfaction. There are blows from which a man's fortune may recover, but a stain upon his public character is a wound of a different sort entirely—a creeping gangrene for which there is no earthly cure, and which a man of principle must cut away at any cost, lest he be consumed by it himself.
