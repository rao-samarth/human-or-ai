You hold to the letter of the law, I perceive, as a man might cling to a faulty compass in a fog, for the comfort of the thing rather than its utility. We erect these grand courts and empower bewigged gentlemen to weigh a man’s soul, believing their detached process will yield some absolute truth; yet I have seen that machinery grind so exceeding slow that the victim is dust long before the scales have even begun to tip. What you saw as a crude settling of a score was, I assure you, something far more considered—a final, lamentable balancing that the world itself refused to perform. Pray, tell me, my friend, when the established system offers a man naught but cold procedure and years of silence, whilst his injury cries out for redress, which is the truer equity? The one pronounced by a stranger in a high-backed chair, or the one enacted, with a heavy heart, by the hand that was wronged?
