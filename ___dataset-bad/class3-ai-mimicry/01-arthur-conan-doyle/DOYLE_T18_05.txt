We were endeavouring to cross the thoroughfare near Aldgate when the entire machinery of public order seemed to grind to a singular halt. It commenced with a costermonger’s barrow, laden precariously with oranges, which shed a single wheel and overturned its cargo in a rolling, golden wave. This deluge startled the horse of a hansom cab, which promptly bolted, forcing a portly gentleman to leap with surprising agility into the arms of a lamplighter ascending his ladder. The pair, locked in an unseemly embrace, swayed perilously for a moment before the ladder gave way, depositing them with a great splash into a water-trough. "My word," exclaimed my companion, gesturing with his cane at the escalating pandemonium, "one might surmise the city is governed by chance alone!" I was inclined to agree, for the sight of a dozen citizens chasing errant fruit whilst a police-constable blew his whistle at a sputtering, half-drowned financier was a spectacle of incompetence too perfect to be anything but accidental.
