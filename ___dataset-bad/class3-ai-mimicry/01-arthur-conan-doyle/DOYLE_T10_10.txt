You look aghast, my boy, but pray consider the consequence. To print the whole of it—every last damning detail of the chairman’s youthful indiscretion—would be to hand the public a loaded pistol with which to execute a man’s entire reputation. The fact itself is undeniable, a grain of perfect, unassailable truth; yet when placed before a baying crowd, it becomes not a fact but a weapon. Our purpose here is illumination, not immolation. By a judicious and carefully-weighed omission, we do not present a falsehood, but rather we withhold a truth that has ceased to be instructive and has become, in this volatile climate, an agent of pure calamity. It is a terrible calculus, I grant you, but a publisher must sometimes be the guardian of the narrative, and not merely its most garrulous servant.
