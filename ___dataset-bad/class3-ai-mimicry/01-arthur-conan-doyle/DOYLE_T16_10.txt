I observed my young cousin, a lad hitherto known chiefly for his retiring disposition, as the dreadful intelligence was delivered by his uncle. A profound and awkward silence fell upon the drawing-room, a vacuum into which most men would have poured some display of agitation. Where one might have expected a collapse of spirit—a wringing of hands or some such commonplace expression of distress—there was instead a most singular stillness. His countenance, though it had grown exceedingly pale, became a mask of resolute composure; the teacup, which he had but a moment before raised to his lips, was set down upon its saucer without the slightest tremor. It is in such unexpected domestic crucibles, I reflected, that the true mettle of a man is most accurately assayed, for the blustering fellow who boasts of his nerve is often the first to falter, whilst the quiet soul, confronted by a genuine crisis, may discover within himself an entirely unsuspected reservoir of fortitude.
