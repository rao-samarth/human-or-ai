Before me stood young Mr. Ames, his ledger forgotten upon the blotter and his face a pale mask of wretchedness. A single misplaced decimal point, an error of the most trivial and yet catastrophic nature, had consigned an entire cargo of Ceylon tea to the wrong hemisphere. Company policy, and indeed common sense, dictated his immediate dismissal; a man so careless could not be trusted with the firm’s reputation, and it seemed his course was now set irrevocably towards failure. Yet, as I observed the tremor in his hand and the genuine horror in his eyes, I was compelled to hesitate. Was this calamitous slip the true measure of the man, the inevitable result of a flawed character destined for ruin? Or was it merely a single, unfortunate turn of the wheel—an event which, if met with a modicum of clemency, might forge a far more reliable and conscientious employee in its fiery aftermath? The boy’s future lay balanced upon that very point, and I confess, the decision of which path to set him upon weighed more heavily than any commercial loss.
