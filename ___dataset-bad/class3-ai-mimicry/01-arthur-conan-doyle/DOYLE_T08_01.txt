I have often observed in these small parish matters a most singular confusion of thought, one which the greater world, for all its supposed wisdom, has by no means rectified. The local blacksmith, a man of simple but violent passions, was wronged, and now the entire village cries out for what they term a just settlement. Yet, when one looks closely, is it truly an impartial balance they seek—that delicate equilibrium which the law strives, however imperfectly, to achieve? I think not. Rather, I see in their narrowed eyes and clenched fists a far more primitive impulse; it is a thirst for simple retribution, where the scales are not merely balanced but are shattered entirely upon the head of the offender. Who, then, is to serve as the ultimate tribunal, when the heart of every man so readily appoints itself both judge and executioner? It is a most perplexing and dangerous state of affairs.
