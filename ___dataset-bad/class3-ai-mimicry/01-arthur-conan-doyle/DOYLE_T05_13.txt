You may believe, sir, that I have acted without honour, and I shall not dispute your judgement, for it is one I have passed upon myself a thousand times in the silent hours. The solemn vow I gave my father upon his death-bed was a matter of no small consequence—it was to secure this very estate, to join our lands with the neighbouring baronetcy in a pact of pure practicality. This compact, however, was framed before my acquaintance with Miss Gable from the vicarage. Her presence in these quiet lanes, a simple and unassuming thing of goodness, rendered all such dry calculations utterly meaningless. To stand by my pledge would have been to condemn three souls, not merely one, to a hollow pantomime of affection, a charade to be performed until the grave. Therefore, I chose the course which you now see before you. Some will call it a gross betrayal; I maintain it was the painful, yet necessary, amputation of a promise that had become a poison to my very being.
