My uncle Theodore, a man whose opinions were as copious as they were uninvited, was holding forth upon the subject of modern child-rearing—a topic he approached with the gravity of a field marshal planning a campaign. He spoke at some length of the necessity for unwavering discipline, for a firm and guiding principle which, he avowed, was the sole bulwark against the rising tide of youthful insolence. Meanwhile, his own progeny, the young Master Percy, was engaged in a wholly different sort of enterprise. Having first smeared a prodigious quantity of jam upon the spaniel’s back, he then proceeded to scale the damask curtains with the agility of a jungle primate, a venture which culminated in the dramatic descent of a porcelain vase. Theodore, entirely oblivious to the miniature cataclysm, merely paused to accept another glass of sherry, remarking loudly that a child's character is, after all, a direct reflection of his father's vigilance.
