I had sought some small refuge from the persistent grey drizzle within the municipal art gallery, where the silence is broken only by the shuffle of feet upon polished floors. My attention, however, was presently drawn not to the canvases but to a hushed colloquy nearby. A gentleman of some means and his companion stood before a most striking portrait—a rendering of a dockworker, whose face was a veritable map of hardship. “Such profound dignity in his struggle,” the lady murmured, her voice filled with a delicate, curated pity. Her escort concurred with a solemn nod, before adding in a lower, more vexed tone, “A pity the genuine article lacks such fortitude. The loiterers near the Embankment this morning were a positive nuisance; one wishes the constabulary would simply sweep them from view.” I found myself observing the painted man once more, whose stoic misery was apparently a source of aesthetic pleasure, whilst his living counterpart was but a sordid inconvenience to be tidied away.
