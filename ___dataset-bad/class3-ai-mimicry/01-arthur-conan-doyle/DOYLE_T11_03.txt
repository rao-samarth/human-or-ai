You must remember, my dear fellow, our guest of last Tuesday, the industrialist with the booming laugh and the rather too-insistent diamond pin. After he had departed, my companion observed from his armchair that while the man’s fortune was plainly new, his family’s poverty was certainly very old. It is a curious science, this art of discerning a man’s origins. It is not a matter of his purse, for a scoundrel may win a fortune at the tables overnight; nor is it entirely in his speech, though that is often a reliable indicator. Rather, it is in the thousand unconscious trifles: the way he holds his fork, the degree of deference he shows to a servant, the slight unease in a room furnished with the quiet confidence of inherited taste. These are the true barriers between one man and another—not of brick or stone, but of subtle habits and ingrained assumptions, more formidable than any fortress wall and quite invisible to the man they are designed to exclude.
