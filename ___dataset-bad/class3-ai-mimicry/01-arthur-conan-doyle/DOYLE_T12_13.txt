Pray do not look so astonished, my dear fellow; the outcome was as inevitable as the sunrise, though considerably less edifying. One hears a great deal of talk concerning conscience and honour, yet I have invariably found that such high-minded notions possess a distinct and, indeed, a measurable monetary value. For some, the price is a king’s ransom; for your man Hemlock, however, a mere handful of sovereigns proved a sufficient inducement to cast aside a lifetime of feigned integrity. You presented him with the glittering prospect of unearned advantage, and now you stand aghast that he seized it? His scruples, it would appear, were not so much overcome by temptation as they were gleefully put up for public auction to the first gentleman who enquired as to their price.
