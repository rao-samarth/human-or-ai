Pray, do not mistake my lack of astonishment for approval, my dear nephew. You imagine, I have no doubt, that this little display of insubordination—this rather theatrical refusal to endorse the company's venture in the colonies—is some grand blow for principle. It is, I assure you, nothing of the sort; it is merely the predictable twitching of a nerve in a system far too vast for your youthful sentiments to comprehend. For generations, men of your earnest stamp have been throwing these same, small pebbles against the great edifice of commerce and empire, and what has been the invariable result? A momentary, clattering noise, a faint dusting of mortar, and then an altogether resounding silence as the pebble falls, quite forgotten, to the ground. The building, you see, does not even notice. It simply stands, as it always has, whilst you are left with nothing but empty pockets and a rather foolish expression.
