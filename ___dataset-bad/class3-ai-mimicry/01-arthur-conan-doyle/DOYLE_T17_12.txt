The entire sad affair between Abernathy and old Finch, which has now divided no small part of the village, had its genesis in a matter so trivial as to be scarcely credible. A brief and, by all accounts, civilly worded missive concerning an overgrown hedge was left upon Finch's doorstep. Yet, in the mind of that singularly suspicious man, this simple request was twisted into a veiled impertinence; a judgement upon his character and his household. His response was a curt refusal, which left the good-natured Abernathy in a state of profound bewilderment. From that day, a wall of silent acrimony was erected between their two properties, a barrier more formidable than any of brick or stone. And thus, from a single phrase, misinterpreted by a proud spirit, the well of neighbourly sentiment was poisoned, perhaps irrevocably, demonstrating what grievous wounds may be inflicted by the slightest of unintended slights.
