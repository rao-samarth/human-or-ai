From my corner table in the quiet café, I became the unwilling observer of a most perplexing collapse of amity. Two gentlemen, who had been conversing with the easy familiarity of old friends, fell into a sudden and intractable silence. The cause, so far as I could discern, was a trifling matter: a remark concerning the timeliness of a returned loan, intended as a compliment to the man’s punctiliousness, was received instead as a pointed insinuation against his prior need. What should have passed with a laugh became, in that instant, a precipice. The gentleman thus offended did not raise his voice; rather, a profound and weary coldness settled upon his features. He simply rose, gave a curt nod that was more dismissal than farewell, and strode out into the evening mist, leaving a chasm of unspoken grievances where a moment before there had been only companionship.
