Mr Atherton gestured with his pen towards the celebratory brandy which his junior partner, Davies, had so eagerly poured. "A most remarkable coup, Davies; you have secured the entire shipping line, lock, stock, and barrel. I confess, your methods have an efficiency which I, from an older school, find quite breathtaking." Davies beamed, but the senior partner’s gaze remained fixed upon the flickering gaslight. "And yet," he continued, his voice lowering to a more contemplative tone, "I find myself considering the matter of old Captain McGregor, a man now quite dispossessed and, I hear, in a lamentable state of health. His own striving built that company from a single, weather-beaten sloop. It is a curious thing, is it not, that for one man to climb so high, another must be cast so utterly into the abyss? One wonders if the view from the summit is truly worth the sight of the precipice you have left in your wake."
