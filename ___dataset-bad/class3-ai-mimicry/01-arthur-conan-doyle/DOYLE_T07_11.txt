I confess, my attention had begun to wander during Lord Ashworth’s rather pompous monologue on colonial policy, a subject upon which he permits no contrary opinion. The entire drawing-room, it seemed, had been cowed into a state of polite, glazed-over submission. It was then that the unexpected occurred. Young Miss Albright, a lady heretofore known only for her skill at watercolours and her timid disposition, offered a quiet but firm correction to one of his more egregious figures. She did not raise her voice, mind you; indeed, her tone was one of utmost deference, and yet the effect was quite electric. A silence fell, thick and immediate, wherein one could almost hear the grinding of the great man’s gears as he sought a retort. He sputtered and attempted a dismissive chuckle, but the tiny seed of dissent had been sown. In that single, brave moment, the carefully constructed edifice of his authority had been shown to possess a most definite and exploitable crack.
