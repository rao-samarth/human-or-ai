My dear Fellworth, I write this to you from the rattling confines of the Cornish express, where I have just witnessed a most curious and instructive little drama. A pompous railway official, a man whose self-importance seemed to swell with every polished button on his uniform, attempted to enforce some new, petty regulation upon a carriage of stoic-faced tin miners. He demanded, with no small measure of imperious condescension, that their meagre parcels be stowed in a manner they deemed impossible. They offered no argument, nor did they raise their voices; they simply remained, their faces set like granite, their collective gaze fixed upon some distant point beyond the carriage window. The official’s blustering threats faltered, then ceased entirely, leaving a most profound silence in their wake. It was a singular demonstration, Fellworth, of how the most entrenched authority may be brought to a standstill not by a show of force, but by the sheer, unmoveable weight of human will.
