My cousin, having newly ascended to a position of considerable influence within the mercantile world, held forth at the dinner table with an energy that quite dominated the room. He spoke of ventures and returns, of competitors soundly outmanoeuvred, his every phrase a monument to his own shrewdness.

It was a scene I had witnessed before in many guises: a man so intent upon the summit that he fails to perceive the wreckage he has made of the path behind him. He had, it was quite clear, won the world; but in the strained silence that followed his every boast, one was forced to question what vital, human part of himself he had been obliged to forfeit in the transaction.
