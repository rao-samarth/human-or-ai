My machinations against Mr. Abernathy now sit upon my soul like some leaden weight. In the cold light of day, the logic of my ambition had seemed unassailable—a necessary, if regrettable, step upon the ladder of commerce. Yet the nighttime hours present a different tribunal, one in which my own character presides as a most unforgiving magistrate. Every tick of the hall clock seems to echo the word ‘deceiver,’ and the very rustle of the firm’s ledgers upon my desk sounds like the whispers of those I have so gravely wronged. I see his face in my mind's eye, not with the anger I had anticipated, but with a look of simple, honest bewilderment—a far more potent condemnation than any outburst. I had reasoned, with some considerable vanity, that success would silence this inner voice; alas, I find it has only provided it a grander chamber in which to thunder its damning verdict.
