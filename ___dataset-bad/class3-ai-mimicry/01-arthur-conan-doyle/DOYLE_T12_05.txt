You speak of ‘principle,’ my dear fellow, as if it were some immutable law of physics, rather than the flimsy theatrical curtain it so often is. I have observed that a man’s principles are remarkably pliable things; indeed, they become quite elastic when a sufficient quantity of gold is applied as a solvent. You saw how Atherton conducted himself—a veritable paragon of public virtue, until the prospect of the Trans-Asiatic railway shares was dangled before his nose. What then of his much-vaunted integrity? It became a mere inconvenience, a trifle to be brushed aside with no more thought than one gives to a speck of dust upon a lapel. Do not look so astonished. For most men, conscience is not a guide but an encumbrance, and its auction price is often far lower than one might suppose.
