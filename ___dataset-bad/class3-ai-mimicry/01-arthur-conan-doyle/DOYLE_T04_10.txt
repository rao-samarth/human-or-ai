I have long observed that a man’s professed allegiance is merely a matter of convenience, a temporary shelter from the prevailing winds of fortune. Take young Harrington, for instance. He spoke with such fervour of his undying fealty, one might have thought him a knight of old pledging himself to a king, rather than a mere neighbour promising to keep a confidence. And yet, what was the price of this noble bond? Not a king’s ransom, I assure you, but the mere whisper of a favourable introduction to Sir Wallace, whose lands, you will note, border his own. Suddenly, his memory grew hazy, his promises became inconvenient hypotheticals, and his principles, it would seem, were as transferrable as a deed of property. One learns not to be surprised by such transactions; one simply adjusts the valuation of such oaths downwards, to their true, trifling market price.
