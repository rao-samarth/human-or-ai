You press me for the particulars of the strain, and I confess it is a singular sort of exhaustion. At the outset, the entire affair is merely a matter of tailoring and accent—a well-cut coat and a carefully modulated tone suffice for the opening act. One feels, indeed, a certain thrill in the performance, a mastery over the credulity of one’s fellows. Yet the human mind abhors a vacuum, and the persona one adopts will, in time, send its own tendrils into the spirit. One lives upon a perpetual precipice; a single misplaced anecdote or a forgotten detail from one’s fabricated past might send the entire structure toppling. The true terror, I have found, is not the exposure one fears from without, but the gradual, silent extinction of the man one once was within. He becomes a ghost, haunting the very vessel he once commanded, and there is no escape from such a companion, not even upon the swiftest of midnight expresses.
