The Dowager Marchioness played her part with a theatricality that I found most instructive. To the assembled relations, she was the very picture of noble suffering; a study in black silk and quiet despair, her face a pale mask from which all vitality had been drained. Every gesture, from the delicate pressure of a lace handkerchief to her eye to the slight, yet perceptible, tremor in her voice, was a masterpiece of studied sorrow. Yet, for all this public display, a man of observation could not fail to note one singular inconsistency. Whilst her shoulders shook with what passed for uncontrollable sobs, her eyes—sharp and calculating as a hawk’s—never once left the solicitor’s hands as he fumbled with the clasp of his briefcase. Here was no widow lost in despair; here, indeed, was a victor awaiting the spoils of a long and patiently fought campaign, and the entire charade was but the final, necessary flourish before the curtain fell upon her triumph.
