My travelling companion, a portly gentleman of considerable self-regard, had for the better part of an hour been expounding upon the virtues of a meticulously charted itinerary. He produced from his valise a veritable library of maps and timetables, declaring with a triumphant air that every moment of our continental tour was accounted for, every contingency foreseen and mastered by his own intellect. A man, he insisted, forges his own path with the hammer of reason upon the anvil of will. It was at the very apex of this grandiloquent pronouncement that a stray dog, having stowed away in the luggage van, made a sudden and frantic bid for freedom, upsetting a porter’s trolley with a calamitous crash. The ensuing chaos saw my companion’s carefully collated documents scattered like autumn leaves, whilst he himself was inadvertently hustled onto a departing train bound not for Vienna, as his will had so firmly dictated, but for a rustic hamlet in entirely the wrong direction. I could not help but smile; for it seems the most resolute of human designs may be undone by the simple, unforeseen whim of a common mongrel.
