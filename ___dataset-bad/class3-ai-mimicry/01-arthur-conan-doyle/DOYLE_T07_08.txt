My travelling companion in this rather stuffy railway carriage, a man whose prosperity was as evident as the gold watch-chain stretched across his waistcoat, was declaiming upon the general indolence of the modern labourer. He insisted that a firm hand and a tightened purse were the only true remedies for such idleness; indeed, he spoke with the absolute certainty of one whose pronouncements have never met with contradiction. The affair might have passed without incident, had not the young fellow opposite, a clean-shaven chap with the calloused hands of a mechanic, looked up from the window. "It is my observation, sir," he said, his voice entirely level, "that a horse which feels only the whip and never the oats will soon decide the cart is not worth pulling." A most profound silence descended upon our compartment, broken only by the clatter of the wheels. The industrialist’s face became a study in puce, for he had been challenged not with a shout, but with simple logic, and against this, he found he had no defence at all.
