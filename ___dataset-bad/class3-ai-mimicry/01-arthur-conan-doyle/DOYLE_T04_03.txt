From my vantage point by the conservatory doors, I observed Harrington in close conference with Lord Ashworth himself. It required no great power of deduction to perceive the nature of their transaction; the earnest, lowered tones of the elder statesman and the avaricious gleam in Harrington’s eye told the entire sordid tale. I saw the moment of decision—that singular, sharp inclination of the head—and knew that he had made his choice. For the promise of some trifling governmental post, the man I once counted as my staunchest ally was bartering away years of mutual confidence. One hears much of the bonds forged in common cause, yet I have found them to be remarkably brittle things when placed under the heat of personal ambition. He will, of course, approach me later with some well-rehearsed excuse for his sudden change of heart, but the damage is done; a man’s character is not revealed in his protestations, but in these quiet, calculated moments of exchange when he believes himself unobserved.
