You must have noted yourself, as we passed the rectory gates, how the very air seems to hold a different quality. It is not a matter of wealth alone, for the new mill owner possesses a fortune that would dwarf the parson’s stipend; yet he is met with a polite but impenetrable reserve.

A fellow may purchase the finest land, but he cannot purchase the hundred small, inherited gestures of deference that are granted to a name which has been rooted in this soil for generations. He remains, for all his gold, a visitor in his own house, forever outside the true walls of this quiet little world.
