You have asked for my assessment of our new director, my dear fellow, and I must tell you that he is a man who merits the closest observation. He presents to the board a countenance of such earnest probity and meticulous habit that one might think him a creature fashioned from ledgers and ink alone. Yet, I have marked how his eyes—which miss nothing, I assure you—betray a flicker of something quite apart from commercial interest when a man of title enters the room. There is, too, the matter of his speech; it is the carefully constructed articulation of an educated man, but a single, ill-chosen provincialism slipped from his tongue last Tuesday, a small crack in the polished veneer through which I glimpsed a far rougher material beneath. He is, I have deduced, an actor upon a stage of his own making, and we should do well to discover the true nature of the play before the final, and likely calamitous, act.
