The gas lamps had begun to cast their jaundiced glow upon the High Street, and I found myself studying the familiar brass plate upon my own door with the detached curiosity of a stranger. My path, it seemed, had been irrevocably set, a straight and honourable road paved by my father's legacy and the expectations of this entire community. It is a good life, a useful one, and the match arranged for me is one of great sense and propriety. Why, then, does the memory of a simple conversation by the mill stream this afternoon rise up to condemn my every resolution? To honour my commitments is the very bedrock of my character, the principle upon which I have built my entire career; yet, to proceed upon this course, knowing my heart is a perjurer and my affections are hopelessly astray, feels like a far greater and more insidious treachery. Therein lies the crux of the matter, a problem no instrument of science or logic can hope to resolve.
