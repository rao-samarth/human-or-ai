The clamour erupted from the market square with an alarming suddenness, a wave of consternation that sent pigeons scattering into the grey sky. I saw the Reeve himself—a man whose accounts, I should wager, would not bear close scrutiny—step upon the horse-block, his face a mask of civic fury. He did not hesitate. His finger shot out, a rigid accusation aimed at a poor pedlar who had but a moment before been mending a kettle; the charge was theft from the public purse, a preposterous notion. Yet, the Reeve’s genius lay not in the substance of his lie, but in its timing. He presented a single, observable fact—that the pedlar was a stranger—and grafted upon it a monstrous invention, all whilst the town’s collective mind was reeling from the initial shock of the alarm bell. It was a most effective piece of stagecraft, an adroit turning of the public’s fear against a convenient scapegoat, transforming a simple craftsman into a villain with nothing more than a loud voice and a well-aimed calumny.
