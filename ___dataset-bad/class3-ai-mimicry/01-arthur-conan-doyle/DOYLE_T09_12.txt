To observe the endless river of faces flowing through the arteries of this great city is to appreciate the profound anonymity it affords. A man might commit some grave error, a betrayal of trust or a dereliction of duty, and believe himself safely lost within the jostling, indifferent crowd. He may even persuade himself that, as his name is unknown and his deed unremarked, he is therefore free. Yet what a foolish delusion this is! For the most formidable prison is not one of stone and iron, but that which the mind erects for itself. There is no magistrate so severe, no jury so unforgiving, as the silent tribunal of one's own recollections. This inner accuser, this sleepless judge, requires no evidence beyond what is already known and presents a case from which there can be no acquittal, turning every crowded thoroughfare into the loneliest cell imaginable.
