We had taken our tea in a small, respectable establishment near Charing Cross, when my companion directed my attention, with a subtle inclination of his head, towards an adjacent table. There, a man of prosperous but agitated appearance was addressing his sister—the family resemblance was quite plain—in low, earnest tones. “Listen closely,” my friend murmured, his eyes alight with that familiar, analytical gleam. “He does not once resort to a direct falsehood; that would be too clumsy, too easily disproven. Instead, he selects his facts as a jeweller selects his gems, presenting only those which glitter to his advantage whilst keeping the flawed, and indeed the most crucial, stones concealed within his velvet pouch. He builds a cage for her reason, you see, not of iron bars, but of carefully chosen, unassailable truths. It is the omission, my dear fellow, the calculated silence, which serves as the most potent instrument of persuasion, for it allows the victim to construct her own prison from the very materials she trusts.”
