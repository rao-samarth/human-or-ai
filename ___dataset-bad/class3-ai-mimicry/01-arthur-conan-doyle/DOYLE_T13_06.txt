My dear chap, I must relate a small but illuminating incident I observed this afternoon whilst navigating the chaos of Fleet Street. A portly fellow, whose self-regard was plainly written upon his florid countenance, was berating a news-vendor with a stream of quite astonishing pomposity, expecting, no doubt, the entire thoroughfare to pause in deference to his station. So consumed was he by the sound of his own booming pronouncements that he took a fatally misjudged step backwards from the kerb. The descent was as swift as it was absolute, landing him amidst the grime and refuse of the street with a most unceremonious thud. Yet, the true sting of it was not the physical blow, but the profound silence that followed; the bustling city, which he had imagined his stage, simply flowed around his ignominious form without a second glance, reducing his grand tragedy to a momentary and quite insignificant obstruction.
