One observes, in these quiet pastoral landscapes, a curious and unending struggle. See yonder wall, constructed with such precision by hands long since turned to dust; its purpose was to delineate, to impose a rigid and unthinking geometry upon the wildness of the earth. Yet, the very soil it presumes to command has sent forth its own agents of insurrection. A creeping vine, with patient and insidious tendrils, seeks out the smallest fissure; the root of a sapling exerts a slow, inexorable pressure from beneath; even the humble lichen works to decompose the very stone. It is a microcosm, I fancy, of that grander principle which governs the affairs of men. The most absolute decree, the most unyielding institution, cannot long stand against the silent, persistent growth of that which it seeks to suppress, for it is a defiance that springs from the very ground of nature itself.
