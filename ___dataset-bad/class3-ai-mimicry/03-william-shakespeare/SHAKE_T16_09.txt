Hark, what sudden clamour from the wood’s deep-shadowed edge, a brutish crack of branch and angry snort that shattered the day’s peace? Forth it burst, a creature of foul temper and monstrous girth, its eye a bead of malice and its tusk a curving blade that promised naught but grievous wounds. A winter chill did seize his very marrow; a palsy took his limbs, which cried for flight, for any sanctuary save this open field of certain peril. Yet, what of his flock, those witless bleating souls entrusted to his charge? To flee was to consign them all to bloody ruin, a treason to his simple post. His knuckles whiten’d on the oaken staff. A fire, born of desperation and of duty, did banish that cold fiend, fear. His heart, a frantic drum against his ribs, did beat a march not of retreat, but of defiance. The beast charged on; the time for quaking thought was past, and only swift and dreadful action now remained.
