The last ember sighs its life away, and the chamber grows cold. My hand, which once knew naught but the cool kiss of a silver chalice, now closes upon this rough-hewn cup of wood; and in its coarseness, I feel a truth more bitter than any dregs. Wherefore did men bow so low before? It was not for the man, but for the glint of his possessions, the finery that cloaked his simple flesh. A man’s station is a borrowed garment, and when fortune strips him bare, the world, which praised the raiment, hath no eyes for the shivering soul within. They would give a prince’s courtesies to a gilded fool ere they would offer a crust to a wise man in rags. Thus are we measured, not by the spirit which God gave us, but by the trifles our fathers left behind, or which our own luck chanced to find.
