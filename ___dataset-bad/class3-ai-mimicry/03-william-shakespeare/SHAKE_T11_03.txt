The last guest hath long since departed, leaving but the ghost of his tedious flattery to haunt the silent air. What a curious pageant we do perform, we men of supposed substance! We bow low to the fellow with the heavier purse, though his mind be but a barren field, and we scorn the honest labourer whose sweat doth salt our very bread. By what mad logic, I ask, is one soul born to command and another fated but to kneel? 'Tis a grand and witless jest, methinks, played by some deaf god for his own amusement. We strut in our velvets, believing the cloth itself bestows a grace upon our wretched frames, whilst a truer nobility might be found in any cur that licks the gutter clean. Ay, the whole affair is a fool's mummery, and the applause we seek is but an echo of our own hollow vanity.
