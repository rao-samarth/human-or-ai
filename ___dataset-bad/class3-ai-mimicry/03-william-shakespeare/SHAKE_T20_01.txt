Hark, how this city’s very stones do ring with the sound of virtue proclaimed aloud; every merchant cries honesty whilst weighing his thumb with the goods, and every pious man doth lecture on humility from a gilded carriage. I saw but a moment past a great lord decry the sin of avarice, then turn to shortchange a simple fruit-seller by a groat. What a curious stage we play upon, where the costume of righteousness is the most common raiment for the most uncommon villainy. Is it not the grandest jest, and a comedy fit for angels to weep at, that a man’s tongue may build him a saint’s halo whilst his hands are busy plucking a purse? In this great pageant of men, the performance is all, and truth but a poor player sent to the wings without a single line. Forsooth, the louder the sermon, the quieter the conscience.
