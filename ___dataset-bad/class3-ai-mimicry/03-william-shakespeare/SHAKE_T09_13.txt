The deed is done; the ledger’s page is turn’d, the false sum writ! With what a frantic haste I thrust the quill to rest, though in my breast a fiercer storm doth rage. My master’s trust, a brittle glass I held, is now but dust; his gold, which I have filch’d, doth burn my very purse like a hellish brand. I start at every footfall on the stair; each creaking board doth cry out my despair and name me villain! What fiend didst whisper in my ear for this? This paltry gain that buys an endless hiss from mine own soul? For now my mind, a cruel judge, doth sit in solemn state and finds no argument to plead my wretched fate. This hidden crime, a scorpion in my blood, stings without cease and promises a flood of bitterest reckoning. I am undone, and by no hand but mine.
