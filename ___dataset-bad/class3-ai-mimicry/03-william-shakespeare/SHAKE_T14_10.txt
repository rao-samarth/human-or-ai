The very house sleeps, and the fire’s last eye doth wink at my transgression. You would have me own this deed as a child of my own will, a thing I conceived and birthed into the world with purpose. But I tell you, sir, the currents of this world are too strong for such small rudders as we possess; we are but leaves upon a torrent, spun about by eddies we cannot see, and what seems a deliberate turn towards the shore is but the water’s whim. When the moment came, my hand was moved by some other force, some grand design writ in the stars ere I was born, which made the action not an act, but an inevitability. My part was merely to be present for the playing. Call it cowardice if you must, but what man, when the heavens themselves conspire to push him from a ledge, has the strength to stand against the firmament?
