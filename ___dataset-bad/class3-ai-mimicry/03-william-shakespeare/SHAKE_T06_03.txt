As we rode forth, I marked how the countenance of my companion, a man of otherwise good temper, did grow most dark and strangely heavy. His gaze fell oft upon the merchant who shared our road, not for his wit or goodly tales, but for the weight of the purse that hung at his belt, a weight that made my friend's own coin seem but a feather. What curious poison is this, that a man’s contentment should be measured not by what he hath, but by what his neighbour possesseth in some greater store? It is a shadow that creeps into the mind unbidden, a cunning worm that gnaws upon a man's own substance, convincing him that his sufficiency is but poverty and another's fortune a most personal slight. He spoke no word of this affliction, yet his quiet was more clamorous than any shout, a sour humour that curdled the very air betwixt us on our weary way.
