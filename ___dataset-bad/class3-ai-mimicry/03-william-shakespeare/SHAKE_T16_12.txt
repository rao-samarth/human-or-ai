The Duke’s great hall, so lately filled with music and with mirth, fell to a hush most grave and absolute. For Lord Corvus, his visage a thundercloud, did make a fell accusation, pointing his jeweled hand at young Sir Alaric and naming him a plotter against the state. What a sudden frost did seize the room; every guest became a statue, their eyes fixed upon the flagstones, fearing to betray by any look what their hearts did think. My own blood turned to ice, and my tongue, a faithless servant, clave to the roof of my mouth. To rise against this man was ruin; a single word of defiance would be a warrant for my own end. Yet, how could I sit mute whilst such a venomous lie took root? Nay, better to perish for the truth than to live a long life nourished by the coward's portion of silence. This trembling in my limbs is but a fleeting ague, a phantom, which must be banished ere it masters me.
