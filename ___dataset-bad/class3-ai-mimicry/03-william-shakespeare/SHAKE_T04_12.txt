Pray, observe Lord Emmon, how he doth now embrace Sir Valerius as a brother long lost, clasping his shoulder with such a show of earnest love. Forsooth, it was but a month past that this same Emmon swore Valerius had the wit of a plough-horse and the honour of a back-alley cutpurse; yet, with the sudden inheritance of his uncle’s fleet, Valerius hath miraculously acquired a most piercing intellect and a soul of purest virtue. How they laugh together! How they share a cup! This sudden amity, methinks, is a ship that sails only in the calmest waters of prosperity; let but one rumour of a sunken cargo or a pirate’s raid reach these shores, and I warrant Emmon will find his dear friend’s company gives him a most grievous indigestion. Such bonds are not forged in the heart, but are merely hired for a season, their strength measured only by the weight of the purse they attend.
