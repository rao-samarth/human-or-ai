Hark you now, young master. See you yonder fellow, how he doth straighten his spine and puff his breast, though his fields lie fallow and his own children cry for bread? Forsooth, a most worthy gentleman! He spent his last shilling upon a tedious suit of law, all because a neighbour’s goat did but nibble his hedge. His good name, he bellowed in the court, was worth more than all the grain in his barn. And so it must be, for now he hath his precious name, and naught else to show for it. A fool’s bargain, I call it; to trade a full belly for an empty word that the wind itself forgets. Let them call me what they will, so long as my larder be full. What use, I ask, is a polished shield upon a starved man’s arm?
