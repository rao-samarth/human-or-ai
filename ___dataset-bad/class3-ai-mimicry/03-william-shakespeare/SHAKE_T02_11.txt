Dost thou think this clamour of the market, this great press of sweating bodies, can conceal the hollow sound of thy own heart? Each protestation of thy love was but a player’s speech, conned and rehearsed to win applause, whilst thy true thoughts did conspire in darker chambers. Thy very countenance, which I mistook for virtue’s own fair glass, proves now a mask of cunningly wrought wax, made but to melt when truth’s hot glare shines forth. Was there ever one true feeling behind those eyes, or was the man I pledged my faith to naught but a phantom, a pleasing shape of air given form by my credulity? Answer me now, before this gaping multitude, for if thy tongue cannot find honesty, then let thy silence stand for guilt and thy public shame be my sole satisfaction.
