The miles do pass in silence, and the mind, unburdened by converse, turns upon itself to weigh its own poor substance. I recall the merchant in the last town, his scales so cunningly contrived, and the whisper that did prompt me to put my thumb upon the beam for but a single weighing. A little gain, a trifle of silver, what harm in such a thing when the world is full of greater thieves? Yet the coin I did not earn sits cold within my purse, a small, hard stone against my flesh, and its weight is more than all the gold I truly own. It buys no bread that does not taste of ash, nor any sleep that is not plagued by phantoms of a truer man I might have been. So heavy is the price of such a light and fleeting advantage; it makes a beggar of the soul whilst it enriches the pouch.
