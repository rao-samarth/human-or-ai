As the candle gutters and the house lies still, my mind turns upon the strange ordering of our mortal state. ’Tis not mere coin, nor the breadth of a man’s lands, that sets his true station; for I have seen a merchant groaning with gold who could not purchase an ounce of true regard from those of better birth. Nay, the division is a finer, more subtle substance, an invisible ink that marks a soul from its first cry. A fellow of base beginnings may by some trick of fate acquire a lord’s vestments, yet his very carriage, the rude cast of his utterance, doth betray him for a counterfeit at every turn. He hath climbed a ladder, perchance, but finds himself in a chamber with no windows. Thus is the law writ not on parchment but in the silent judgment of our peers; a grammar of degree that all men understand, though none can say who was its author.
