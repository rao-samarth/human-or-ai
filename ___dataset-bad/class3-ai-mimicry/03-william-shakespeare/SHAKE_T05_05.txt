Dost thou then think me some base churl, whose heart is proof against thy tears? Heaven knows this choice doth cleave my soul in twain, and every word I speak is a fresh dagger to myself. But what am I, if not the poor instrument of my father’s dying wish, bound by a vow more sacred than this fleeting passion? To follow thee would be to break faith with the dead, to scorn the legacy for which my ancestors did bleed, and to make of my good name a foul reproach amongst all honest men. Think me not cruel, but rather cruelly fated. This path of honour, though it be a barren and a lonely road, is one I needs must walk. For if I am not true to my own bond, how could I, in conscience, ever have been true to thee?
