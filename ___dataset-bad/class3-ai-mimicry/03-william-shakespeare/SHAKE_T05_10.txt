He speaks now of our union, of a house made strong, and I do furnish him a placid smile whilst my heart, that wretched rebel, doth beat a frantic drum against my ribs. My vow, a solemn chain forged long ago by wiser heads than mine, clinks with his every measured word, a constant and a cold reminder of the part I am to play. But O, your memory is a subtle poison in my veins, a sweet and damning fever for which I would not have the cure. My duty is a map laid plain upon a table, each road and boundary marked with cold and certain reason; it is a fortress, safe and well-defended. You are the wild and uncharted country just beyond its edge, a perilous and promised land for which my soul would gladly play the fool and be forever lost. I nod and feign to listen, yet I am not here at all.
