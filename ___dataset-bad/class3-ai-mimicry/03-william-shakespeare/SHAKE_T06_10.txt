Behold how fortune smiles upon that man, whose easy grace doth capture all the light within this hall. He speaks, and every ear is held a willing captive to his tongue; he jests, and even the Duke’s stern countenance doth crack into a grin. And I? I stand a sentinel in shadow, my own service and long labours turning now to dust within my memory. A sharp and burning bile doth rise to think how such a man, a painted butterfly, may win with but a flutter what I have sought with all a soldier’s strength. Every gilded word he speaks is as a thorn that pricks my very soul, for his ascent is built upon the grave of my own hopes. Alas, what bitter draught is this, to watch another drink the wine for which you thirst, and see him praised for finding it so sweet.
