Forsooth, what judgement am I bid to render when fate itself doth play the jester? The axle, with a groan most pitiful, gave up its ghost and cast us all into the mire. Lord, what a spectacle! Yon fat-pursed tradesman, who but an hour past boasted of his worldly wit, now bellows like a stuck calf, his velvet breeches most foully besmirched. A lady of supposed gentle breeding shrieks at a heavens that will not answer, whilst our driver, a knave with more hair than sense, curses the horse that did not snap its leg. And I? I stand upon a hummock, clutching this parcel as if it were my first-born son, and must now choose: shall I lend a hand to these flailing fools and see my prize-winning gooseberry pie, the very pride of my parish, trampled into the muck? Or shall I let them sink, and thereby save the sweeter cause?
