Here, amidst the feigned smiles and hollow laughter of kinsmen, my soul doth find itself a most unwilling prisoner. Each courteous word I speak is a bar upon the cage, each nod of fealty to my father’s will a stone upon my chest. For how can a man pledge his future to a house, to a name, to a face he knows only as a sigil on a scroll, when his every waking thought flies to another? This gilded hall is but a tomb to my true affections, and the music a dirge for a love that dares not speak its name. My vow, a sacred bond made before God and man, hath become a heavier chain than any felon's iron, for it binds not my hands, but the very spirit that gives them life. Alas, to be torn thus is a torment worse than any honest villainy, for my crime is but to have a heart that reason cannot rule.
