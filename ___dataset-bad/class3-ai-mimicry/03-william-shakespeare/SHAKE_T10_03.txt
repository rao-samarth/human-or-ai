Hath he not, with sugared venom and a courtly phrase, sought to persuade me that my own accounts are folly, and my judgment but a green and witless thing? For many a fortnight hath this subtle poison worked upon my spirit, making me to doubt the very evidence of mine own senses. Yet what is this? A sudden clarity, a piercing light that cuts the gloom he fashioned. I see his figures for the hollow things they are, a cunning shape with no true substance, designed to keep me low and bind me to his will. But truth, I find, is a most stubborn and resilient root; though buried deep beneath a mound of shifting falsehoods, it doth press upward toward the sun. And in its light, I see my path anew, unburdened by the shadows he so carefully did cast. My own worth is not in his report, but in the honest craft my hands have wrought, a knowledge that doth make me stand more tall than ever he intended.
