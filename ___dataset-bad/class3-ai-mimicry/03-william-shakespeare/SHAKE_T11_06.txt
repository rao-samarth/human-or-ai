Hark, what strange and potent magic doth compel this human tide to part? Here in the crush and clamour of the street, where breath and sweat do mingle in one common cloud, I am pressed on all sides by rough-hewn men whose shoulders are as stout as mine own. Yet see, a lordling passes, his fine-spun raiment scarce disturbed by the mob, for they do shrink from him as if he wore a burning cloak. No word is spoken, no command is given, yet a space is made where none existed but a moment ere. Is his flesh not as ours, subject to the same aches and mortal frailties? Wherefore, then, doth this invisible wall arise, built of naught but name and station, more solid and impassable than any mason's stone, condemning one man to the mire whilst another walks on air?
