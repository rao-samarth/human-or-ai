This little plot of earth, which heaven hath granted me, was once the sum of all my worldly prayer; it gave me bread and peace, and I was well content. But see, how mine own eye doth play the traitor to my soul! It strays upon my neighbour's sprawling acres, where the corn stands thick and golden, and a serpent's voice whispers into mine ear of boundary stones misplaced in the deep night, of cunning falsehoods spoken to the law. Wherefore doth this fever take a man, to make him covet what he needs not, and risk his honest name for but a little more of that which is but dust? To gain a yard of soil, I stand to lose myself, and yet the hunger for it gnaws apace, a foul and endless wanting that turns good sufficiency to bitter lack.
