The last candle sputters, its weak light a poor sentinel against the shadows that creep from every corner of this silent house. My coffers are lighter by far than they were at sunrise, a truth that sits like a cold stone within me. They would have had me swallow the lie, grow fat upon its poisoned fruit, and smile as my own good name was made a common jape in the marketplace. Nay, I would not suffer it. Let them call me a poor fool; their words are but wind that cannot shake a well-rooted tree. For what is a man when all his gold is counted, if he cannot look upon his own visage in a polished glass without seeing the mark of a villain? I have purchased with my fortune that which hath no price: a quiet soul, and the right to stand in the sun, however pale it shines on me now, without a shadow of shame.
