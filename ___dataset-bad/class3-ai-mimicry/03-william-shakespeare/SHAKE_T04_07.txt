I have observed how a sworn bond, much like a winter brook, may alter its course when the great thaws of fortune arrive. He whose hand I once held in common cause, whose simple word was worth a coffer of gold, now speaks with a gilded tongue that rings hollow upon the ear. It is not malice, I think, that works this change, nor any plotted treachery hatched in darkness; rather, it is the slow and quiet pressure of a rising station, which doth so elevate a man that he can no longer see the faces of those he hath left below upon the humble ground. His promises remain, but their substance has fled, leaving behind but a courteous echo. And so, one learns that fealty is not a stone, fixed and eternal, but a living plant that must be tended in the same soil, or else it withers in another’s sun.
