The candle gutter'd low, its feeble light scarce showing me mine own face in the dark glass. What painted counterfeit is this that stares from out the shadows? This is not the man they saw but hours since; for he was full of pleasant jests and easy smiles, a ready friend to any who would ask. Yet here, alone, that borrowed visage falls away, and what is left? A hollow thing, whose own true thoughts have been so long suppress'd they speak no more. I have play'd the part so well, with such a constant and unwearied craft, that I do fear the actor hath at last consum'd the man, and left but this strange ghost to haunt the empty stage of mine own chamber. Wherefore did I begin this mummery, this careful treason against mine own soul? The prize is won, yet the victory tastes of naught but ash.
