That he should perceive me press a coin into the urchin’s palm, and straightway fashion it in his mind as payment for some black purpose—O, what devil’s logic hath possessed him! Now, here, before the gawking rabble of the market, he doth proclaim my villainy aloud, his visage enflamed with a choler I have never known. I sought to make my reason plain, to speak of charity, but my words were drowned in the thunder of his accusation. He calls my honest pity a foul conspiracy and our long amity but a gilded cage for his undoing. So be it, then! If a simple act of grace can be so twisted by suspicion into monstrous shape, then all our sworn brotherhood was but a house of glass, and with this one stone of wrongful grievance, he hath shattered it beyond all mending.
