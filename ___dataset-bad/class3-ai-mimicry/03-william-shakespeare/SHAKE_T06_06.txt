Here, in this quiet field, the canker of another’s fortune finds no root within my soul. For wherefore should I measure my own modest plot against my neighbour’s sprawling acres, when this same sun warms me as it warms him, and this gentle breeze doth cool my brow no less than his? A foul poison it is, this constant looking sideways, which sours the sweet milk of a man's own content. But here, I shall let it go; I shall let it drain from me as yonder brooklet carries fallen leaves away toward the wider stream, leaving the water clear behind. A man’s true wealth is not the sum of what his fellow hath, but the quiet peace he finds in his own keeping. Let him keep his prize; mine own is this clean air, and a spirit at last unburdened by the weight of what is not.
