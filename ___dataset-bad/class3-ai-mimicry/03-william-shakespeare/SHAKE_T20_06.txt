Mark well our goodly Bailiff, who from his high seat doth rail against the demon drink and the idleness it breeds in lesser men. His voice, a thunderclap of sternest virtue, shakes the market-cross and frightens the very pigeons from their perch. He speaks of sober industry, of souls imperil'd by the ale-house tap, and of the civic purity that abstinence alone can purchase for our humble town. Yet when the moon, a knowing accomplice, hangs high above the cobbled lanes, who is it that stumbles from that selfsame tavern door, his righteous path a drunken weave? His mighty sermon on clarity is then but a foul-breathed mumble to a stray dog, his only true congregation. Forsooth, his spirit is most willing to condemn the sin in public assembly, but his flesh, it seems, remains a most eager and thirsty sinner in the dark.
