My Dearest Friend, from amidst this glittering throng, where music strives to drown the din of empty praise, mine eye doth fall upon our celebrated host. He stands a pillar of accomplishment, clad in silks so fine they mock the moon's own sheen, and every soul in this great hall doth court his favour with a fawning grace. He hath all that men do strive for; his coffers overflow, his name is spoken with a reverent hush, and his power is a shadow that falls across the entire shire. Yet I beseech you, look upon his face when he believes none are watching. The mask of triumph falls, and there you shall see a desolation, a vast and lonely plain where conscience once did bloom. For what honest joys, what simple trusts, what measure of his own heart hath he traded for this high and cold estate? I think he hath built his new world upon the ruins of the old, and finds his own soul a stranger in the very kingdom he hath won.
