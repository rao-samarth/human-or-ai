Fie on such hollow courtesies; your tongue is a more cunning craftsman than any Florentine sculptor, for it carves from the marble of plain fact a monster to suit your purpose. You present the court with the blade, still sullied, and point to my hand that held it, crying for justice. Yet you neglect to show them the serpent whose head it severed, the venomous plot that made my swift action a necessity, not a crime. You serve them a feast of half-knowledge, a single chapter torn from the book, and bid them judge the whole story by its most bloody page. This is not honesty; 'tis a poison distilled from verity itself, more potent and damnable than any simple lie you could conjure. Your carefully pruned account makes your part seem fair and mine most foul, and by such artifice, you have murdered my good name with a truth that is no truth at all.
