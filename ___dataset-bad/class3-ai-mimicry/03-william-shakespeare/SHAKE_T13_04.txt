Hark, and mark me well, for what I speak is born of bitter truth. Not an hour past, my own great vanity did puff me up like a peacock in the sun, and I, a fool so gilded by my fancies, thought my voice the only music worthy of this hall. My wit, I deemed it a sharp and peerless sword; my station, a mountain from which I looked on lesser hills. But with one ill-wrought jest, one boastful word too many, the fragile cage of my own making was shattered. A hush fell then upon this company, a cruel and judging quiet, and in that void I saw myself reflected in your eyes: not a lord, not a lion, but a simple bauble, hollow and ringing false. Pray, look upon this ruin of a man, for I am brought so low that I must dig to find the dust.
