This jolting cart doth mock the very stillness of my heart, for though my body moves toward some new horizon, my spirit is a prisoner still. With every turn of the wheel, I practise the smiles and courteous replies that are not mine, rehearsing a nature that is but a stranger to my own. I have worn this borrowed countenance for so long, methinks my proper features have forgot themselves; my tongue, a hired actor, speaks words so foreign to my soul that I do startle at their sound. This gilded shell, this carefully constructed gentleman, is but a hollow thing, a puppet moved by fear. When at last I reach my destination and this pageant must be played in earnest, I wonder what true man shall be left within to answer to my name? Perchance there will be none at all, only the empty costume and the echo of a lie.
