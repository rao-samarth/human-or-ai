In this poor village, where every soul doth know his neighbour’s business ere he knows his own, a most silent and subtle play is every day perform’d. The goodwife, who curtsies low to the parson’s wife, harbours a viper’s envy in her breast; the farmer, who commends his rival’s crop, prays nightly for a blight to fall upon that very field. So each man walks, a player in a part he hath not writ, his true heart lock'd within a cage of ribs whilst his tongue speaks a language of false comfort and easy smiles. They call it peace, this careful arrangement of kind words and kinder looks, yet it hath the substance of a morning mist. What sad and hollow thing is a life thus spent, where the only honest face a man may see is his own, reflected in a well’s dark water, and even then, he looks away.
