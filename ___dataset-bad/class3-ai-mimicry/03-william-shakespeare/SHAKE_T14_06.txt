We do profess to be the masters of our days, charting each voyage with a will as firm as adamant. Yet I have watched the stream, which knows not its own mind, and see it turn where the unyielding earth commands it, and break upon the stones that lie in its appointed bed. We swear our solemn oaths and make our plans as if the firmament itself must needs attend upon our purpose; but when the sudden frost doth blight the summer's hopeful bud, or when an unlooked-for tempest drives the stoutest ship to ruin, what then of our great declarations? Perchance our truest art lies not in commanding the unalterable tide, but in learning its season; a wisdom that finds its shape not in the grand design, but in the humble turning of a single stone upon the path before us.
