Our carriage, with a groan that might have split the very heavens, did give up its wheel to the gluttonous mud, and in that instant all civility fled our company. Sir Barnaby's coffer of rare spices burst its clasps, dusting a fat friar in cinnamon and cloves until he sneezed with the force of a thunderclap, whilst a scholar's carefully penned treatise on the nature of Order took to the air like a flock of startled geese. The driver's boy, a creature of more haste than sense, sought to secure the lurching vehicle, but in his flurry he did seize the wrong harness and thereby sent the lead horse galloping into a thicket of thorns. There we sat, pitched at a most unseemly angle, listening to the beast’s indignant whinny and the friar’s ceaseless sneezing, a more perfect picture of mischance and human folly than any playwright could ever hope to stage.
