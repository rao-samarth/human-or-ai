Master Balthazar, with smiling poison, lays before me this devil's bargain: a purse heavy with gold, and a quill to sign my own damnation. He bids me take the blame for his miscounted sums, to write myself the author of this ruin that he alone hath wrought. Shall I accept this gilded exile, and live henceforth a villain in the mouths of honest men, my name a curse upon the very stones I walk? Or shall I stand against him, and by speaking plain truth, be crushed? For his station is a mighty fortress, and my word but a poor shepherd's plea against the wind. The ledger lies open, a pale and silent witness to his crime, yet he would have me blot its pages with a lie that saves his skin and flays my own. To live with a sullied name, or to perish with a clean one—what choice is this, when either path leads to a kind of death?
