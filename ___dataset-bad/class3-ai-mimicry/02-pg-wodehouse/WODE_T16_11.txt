I’ve often found, when rattling through the countryside in one of these railway contrivances, that the true mettle of a fellow is best observed when the rattling abruptly ceases. We had just lurched to a standstill somewhere between Little-Wigging-on-the-Wold and goodness-knows-where, and the effect on the carriage was instantaneous and instructive. A sort of collective gasp went up, followed by a low buzzing, as if a beehive had been gently kicked. Most of the occupants began peering out of the windows with the anxious, uncomprehending expressions of sheep contemplating a new type of gate. It is in these moments, I have concluded after careful study, that the chap you’d expect to take charge—some beefy specimen with a military moustache, say—is generally the first to start bleating for the guard. Instead, it was the small, unassuming cove in the corner, the one who looked like he’d apologise to a chair for bumping into it, who calmly stood up, cleared his throat, and suggested we all remain seated until we had some proper information. A simple act, to be sure, but it cooled the fevered brow of the compartment in a jiffy. It just goes to show.
