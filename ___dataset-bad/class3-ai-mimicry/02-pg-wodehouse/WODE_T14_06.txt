My dear Cuthbert, your letter has set me to pondering the whole dashed shooting-match, particularly as I observe it here amidst the rustic tranquillity. Take, for instance, the simple parsnip. I, with my own two hands and a considerable expenditure of what old Biffy calls ‘the old grey matter’, decided that a row of them would look corking by the gooseberry bushes. One takes a seed, one plants it; a straightforward piece of business, you’d think, demonstrating a chap’s firm grip on the tiller. But then, along comes a mole—a blighter with the architectural ambitions of a Brunel and the moral scruples of a confidence trickster—and turns my entire enterprise into what looks suspiciously like a relief map of the Alps. It does rather make a fellow question whether he is the master of his ship or merely the chap who polishes the brass while a large, furry captain steers it straight for the rocks. A rum state of affairs, what?
