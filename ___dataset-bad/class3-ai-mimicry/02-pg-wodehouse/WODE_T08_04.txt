My dear Alistair, I’ve been ruminating on your little spot of bother with Pilkington, and frankly, the whole business puts a fellow in a bit of a spin. One finds oneself asking, as the traffic roars and the newsboys bellow down Fleet Street, what’s what and who’s who when it comes to settling a score. On the one hand, there’s the undeniable appeal of, say, swapping the salt for the sugar in the blighter’s tea—a short, sharp shock to the system that serves him jolly well right. Yet on the other, one has chaps in wigs and committees and whatnot, all insisting that the matter be handled through the proper channels, a process which can take an age and seldom results in a really satisfactory comeuppance. It’s a dashed tricky business, determining whether one is administering a much-needed lesson or simply being a vindictive ass, and I find the sheer noise of this city does little to clarify the old grey matter on the subject.
