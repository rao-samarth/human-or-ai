It was one of those beastly mix-ups that can so easily curdle the milk of human kindness in an otherwise tranquil commercial establishment. Young Reginald Psmith (no relation) had been breezily instructed by the Guv'nor, a Mr. Biggleswade of formidable jowl, to “put the lid on the Pilkington proposal for good.” Reggie, taking this with the solemn finality of a chap being told to dispatch a favourite but ailing aunt, had promptly fed the entire dossier into the firm’s most enthusiastic shredder. This, it transpired, was not what Biggleswade had meant at all; he’d merely wanted a lid put on the document box. The air grew thick, what? Biggleswade’s face took on the alarming hue of a ripe damson, and poor Reggie was mentally packing his bags. But then, just as the axe was being sharpened, a telegram arrived. The Pilkington proposal was a frightful dud, a swindle of the first water! By a stroke of pure, blundering genius, Reggie had saved the firm from a nasty financial bath. It just goes to show that even when one has made a complete hash of things, the sun has a sporting habit of peeking through the clouds.
