I found myself hauled before the formidable presence of Miss Penhaligon, our office manager, a woman who regarded the unauthorised relocation of a paperclip as a crime somewhere on the spectrum between high treason and leaving the lid off the biscuit tin. It appeared that my modest, and I still maintain rather tasteful, amendment to the weekly staff bulletin had not met with universal acclaim. She fixed me with a gaze that could have curdled milk at twenty paces and pointed a trembling finger at the offending document, where her stern directive about punctuality was now nestled beneath a charming, hand-drawn sketch of a dormouse enjoying a nap. A chap has to stand his ground, of course, so I simply explained that the original notice possessed a certain bleakness, a soupçon of the tomb, and that I felt a touch of whimsy would aid its digestion by the rank and file. It was at this point that her complexion, normally a pale beige, began to take on that rich, plummy shade one associates with the setting sun and the imminent explosion of a gasometer.
