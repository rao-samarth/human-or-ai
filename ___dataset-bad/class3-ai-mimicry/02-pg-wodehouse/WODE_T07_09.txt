A certain Alderman Pootle, a man whose chin had entirely given up the struggle and retreated into his neck, had decreed that all public whistling must cease forthwith; it was, he boomed, a public nuisance on par with runaway omnibuses. The city, he felt, required a more solemn and dignified atmosphere. One might have expected a bit of grumbling, a few cross letters to the papers, and then a grudging acceptance of the new status quo. But one would have been frightfully wrong. Instead, a peculiar and rather wonderful thing happened. The very next morning, as if by some unspoken agreement, the entirety of Trafalgar Square was filled not with whistling, but with the gentle, rhythmic tapping of teaspoons against saucers, a thousand tiny, tinkling bells of defiance. It was a perfectly civilised insurrection, you see, a sign that even the most overstuffed authority can be answered with a spot of cheerful absurdity, and it made a fellow feel that all was, after all, right with the world.
