A sacred duty, she’d called it, involving a great rusty key and a perilous ladder. The spanner in the works, however, arrived in the form of a note from Phyllis, suggesting a picnic by the weir at precisely the same hour; and Phyllis, I should mention, is the sort of girl whose smile could make a bishop kick a hole in a stained-glass window. So there I was, caught between the cogs of civic responsibility and the far more appealing prospect of a Battenberg cake shared à deux. It was enough to make a fellow wish he were an octopus, if only for the extra limbs to be in two places at once.
