Receiving old Henderson’s booming praise for the new filing initiative—an initiative, to be strictly accurate, that had sprung fully-formed from the brow of poor Blevins in Stationery—was an experience akin to chewing on tin foil. The inner man, that frightful little killjoy who keeps a ledger of one’s shabbier moments, began to kick up the most fearful racket, demanding a full confession and no doubt a spot of sackcloth and ashes. It’s a bally nuisance, this sort of thing, especially when a promotion is shimmering on the horizon. One tries to muffle the little blighter with thoughts of an increased salary and the respect of one’s fellows, but it’s no good; he simply carries on, banging his little gongs and pointing an accusing finger, leaving one to feel like a blundering ass who’s pinched the vicar’s collection plate. The only comfort is that Blevins, being Blevins, would probably have fumbled the presentation anyway.
