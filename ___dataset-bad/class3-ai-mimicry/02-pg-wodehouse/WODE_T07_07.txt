It had long been an established fact at Meadowsweet Manor, a piece of lore as immutable as the law of gravity or the certainty of rain on a bank holiday, that the stone cherub by the rose bushes was not to be trifled with. Uncle Reginald had placed it there in 'ought-eight' and its gaze, he maintained, was calibrated to the inch to ward off black-spot. I, however, had begun to view the little chap's plight with a growing sense of social responsibility. Was it right, I asked myself, for a perfectly decent piece of statuary to be doomed to an eternity of contemplating nothing but diseased foliage? A swift, decisive action was called for; a gentle rotation of ninety degrees to afford him a view of the rolling downs. Uncle Reginald, upon discovering this benign act of civic improvement, took on the sort of puce colouring one usually associates with an overripe plum that has been told some particularly distressing news. He spoke of insurrection and the crumbling of empires, while I was merely trying to explain that the cherub now had a much more cheerful outlook. The whole affair, it seems, was rather lost on him.
