It is a rummy thing, the old conscience. For the better part of a week after I had, with a grave and sorrowful nod, allowed the managing director to conclude that poor young Bletchley was the true author of the catastrophic blunder in the Fincham file, the inner man had been giving me the very dickens. It was not unlike having inadvertently swallowed a small, bad-tempered hedgehog which had decided to take up permanent lodgings and practice its spikier manoeuvres. Every time the boss passed my desk with a cheery "Good work spotting that, Pilkington!" a nasty little voice deep within would whisper a distinct "I say, you rotter!" which quite soured the morning's tea. The wretched thing was beginning to fray the nerves. I found myself jumping at the clatter of a dropped teaspoon and viewing my own reflection in the window-pane with the sort of pained disapproval one reserves for a chap who has just cheated at tiddlywinks.
