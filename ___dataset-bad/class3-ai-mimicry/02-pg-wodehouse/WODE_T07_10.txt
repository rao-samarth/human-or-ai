Mr Abernathy, a man whose profile suggested that a well-meaning ancestor had had a rather unfortunate run-in with a steamroller, paused in his dictation. He fixed young Billings, the new junior clerk, with the sort of glacial stare usually reserved for waiters who bring the wrong vintage. "Billings," he said, the name emerging from his lips like a particularly stubborn olive from a bottle. "The matter of the quarterly biscuit report. You have filed it under 'B' for 'Biscuit', have you not?" Young Billings, a cheerful soul who had hitherto regarded Mr Abernathy with the misplaced reverence one gives to a dormant volcano, offered a sunny smile. "Actually, sir," he chirped, "I filed it under 'Q' for 'Quarterly'. Seemed the more logical peg to hang it on, what?" A profound silence descended upon the office, the kind of heavy, expectant hush that precedes the breaking of a great dam or the announcement of a terrible music-hall comedian. Mr Abernathy's left eyebrow began to twitch. "Henceforth, Billings," he articulated, each word a frozen dagger, "biscuits go under 'B'." Billings simply nodded brightly. "Right you are, sir. 'Q' it is."
