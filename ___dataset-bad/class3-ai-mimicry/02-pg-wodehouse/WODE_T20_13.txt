My dearest Biffy, it is now pushing two in the a.m., and the house is as silent as a tomb that’s forgotten its lines. This quietude is chiefly because Aunt Honoria has finally retired, having spent the better part of the evening delivering a rather blistering sermon on the importance of self-denial and the moral flabbiness of the modern age. She spoke with particular venom against the evils of late-night snacking, a habit she ranked somewhere between safe-cracking and voting for the wrong sort of fellow. It was, therefore, with a certain wide-eyed astonishment that, popping down to the pantry for a splash of soda water, I happened upon the source of a peculiar muffled munching. There she was, the old Spartan herself, surrounded by the glittering ruins of a box of Belgian chocolates, looking for all the world like a venerable owl who’s just been caught raiding a patisserie. It simply goes to show, what? One’s principles are one thing, but a praline is quite another.
