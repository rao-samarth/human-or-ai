It strikes me, Uncle Wilfred, that when a fellow finds himself in the bouillabaisse, he doesn’t so much invent falsehoods as perform a sort of judicious curation of what is, strictly speaking, true. One never actually states that a thing happened which did not; heavens, no, that would be frightfully bad form. Instead, one acts as a kind of impresario for the facts themselves, ushering some into the bright glare of the footlights while encouraging others to remain backstage, perhaps sorting the props or having a quiet smoke. The open window, for instance, was an absolute given—a solid, bankable star of the piece. The muddy bootprint by the door? Another headliner. That the bootprint was my own from the previous afternoon’s disastrous attempt at gardening and that the window had been opened to air out the scent of kippers was, I felt, fussy backstage detail that would only confuse the audience and muddy the lovely, clean through-line of a narrative that was shaping up so promisingly. One simply presents the evidence one wishes to be seen, and if the other party pieces it together into a portrait of a one-legged burglar, that’s a tribute to his imagination, not my mendacity.
