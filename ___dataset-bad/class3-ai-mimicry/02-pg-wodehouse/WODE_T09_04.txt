It was the pat on the back from old Threepwood that really twisted the knife. One moment, I was basking in the sunshine of managerial approval; the next, a small, cold voice from somewhere in the vicinity of my waistcoat pocket began to pipe up with the most frightfully inconvenient observations. You see, the Threepwood Patent Stapler Solution—the very idea for which I was now being lauded as a rising star of industry—had, in point of fact, sprung fully-formed from the brow of poor Wilberforce in the post room. I had merely overheard his timid murmurings by the water-cooler and, in a moment of sheer, dazzling opportunism, presented the notion as my own. Now, every hearty “Well done, old man!” felt less like a commendation and more like a spectral finger jabbing me in the ribs. The inner chap was giving me no peace at all, carrying on like a bailiff who’s discovered you’ve been hiding the family silver, and making me feel, all in all, an absolute rotter of the first water.
