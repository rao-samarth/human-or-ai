The entire affair could have been a frightful muddle, I grant you, what with the street performer’s escaped parrot perching on Constable Albright’s helmet and squawking passages from the nautical almanac. Add to this a runaway perambulator, which had chosen that precise moment to execute a complex flanking manoeuvre around a stack of fish crates, and you have a scene that would test the mettle of the sturdiest soul. Yet, somehow, in the thick of it all—as Albright reasoned with the bird and a hearty greengrocer headed off the pram with a well-aimed cabbage—one couldn’t help but feel a certain sunny optimism about the whole business. The sheer, magnificent incompetence of it all was rather cheering. It served as a fine reminder that even when the city’s machinery seems to have slipped a cog or two, things have a jolly way of sorting themselves out, usually with a good deal more laughter than one had any right to expect.
