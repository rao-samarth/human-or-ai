It had been a truth universally acknowledged in the purlieus of Meadowsweet Manor that Mrs. Plummett, the cook, was a woman not to be trifled with; her dominion over the kitchen was absolute, her pronouncements on pastry final. She ran the place with the firm hand of a field marshal inspecting the troops, and the very jellies were said to wobble at her approach. Therefore, the sight of Beatrice, the usually timid parlourmaid, quietly substituting Mrs. Plummett’s infamous boiled onions with a dish of what looked suspiciously like devilled kidneys was a spectacle of the first water. It was the sort of quiet mutiny that makes history. The air grew thick with a palpable tension, the kind you could slice with a fish knife, and I found myself instinctively seeking cover behind a large cheese plant. One didn't know what would happen next, but one felt with a chilling certainty that the established order of things was about to take a fearful toss into the salad bowl.
