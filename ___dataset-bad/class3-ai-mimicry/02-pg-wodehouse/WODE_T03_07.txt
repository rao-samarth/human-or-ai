Pacing the library floor at this ungodly hour was doing precious little for the old nervous system, but what was a fellow to do? Sleep was quite out of the question. The ghastly tale of my encounter with young Bicky’s prize-winning salamander had, it seemed, grown legs of its own and was now sprinting through the county’s better drawing-rooms. What had begun as a simple, if ill-advised, prank was being painted as a deliberate act of zoological sabotage. A chap’s standing, I mused, is a frightfully delicate thing, rather like a soufflé; the slightest tremor and the whole edifice collapses into a sorrowful puddle. To have one’s name associated with amphibian-related skulduggery was bad enough, but to be thought of as a cold-blooded newt-napper… well, it simply wouldn’t do. Drastic measures were clearly required before I was drummed out of civilized society for good.
