It all began, as these soul-searing village feuds invariably do, with a bit of fluff that ought to have been swatted away like a bothersome gnat. The Vicar, a mild man whose chief ambition was to see more primroses by the lychgate, had apparently remarked to his gardener that the churchyard could do with "a spot more life." This innocent utterance, upon passing through the clarifying filter of the postmistress’s ears, emerged as a fully-formed plot to install dodgem cars and a helter-skelter amongst the ancestral stones. The news reached Major Finsbury-Tuttle, a man whose blood pressure was a local marvel, who promptly declared war. He now saw the Vicar not as a gentle soul with a penchant for horticulture, but as a fiend in a dog-collar bent on desecrating the sacred peace. And so the battle lines were drawn, petitions circulated, and lifelong friendships were sundered over the imagined threat of a coconut shy next to the Bishop’s tomb; a fine example of the human intellect, is it not, when it decides to take a holiday?
