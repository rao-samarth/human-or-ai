Percy stopped his agitated pacing and fixed me with a look that would have melted butter, had the butter been of a particularly nervous disposition. "The long and the short of it, old man," he blurted out, his voice quavering like a badly set blancmange, "is that you must take the blame for the hedgehog." I blinked. It was not, I grant you, the sort of conversational gambit one expects over a quiet afternoon sherry, and it struck me as being in the poorest possible taste. For while I had always held our amicable relations in the highest esteem, there is a line, and that line is generally drawn well short of falsely confessing to smuggling spiny mammals into the private study of one's host, particularly when said host is a retired Brigadier with a short temper and a pronounced view on vermin. It was a ghastly moment, one of those awful pauses when a fellow feels the very foundations of a lifelong camaraderie begin to shudder, and you have to ask yourself if the bonds of amity can truly stretch to cover small, prickly quadrupeds.
