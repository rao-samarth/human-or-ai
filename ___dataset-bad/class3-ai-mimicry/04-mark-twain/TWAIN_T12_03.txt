The house settled around me with the groans of a dying man, which I figured was only fitting, and the grandfather clock in the hall took a terrible long time to murder each second. My eyes kept landing on that iron box of his, sitting there on the mantelpiece looking as smug and self-satisfied as a parson with a full collection plate. A person of delicate sensibilities, the kind who faints at the sight of a spider, might call my intentions something akin to thievery. But I call it simple prudence. The man was gone to whatever reward awaited him—a leaner reward than he’d advertised, I reckon—and his earthly accounts were left in a considerable tangle. It seemed a plain duty, then, a sort of charitable accounting, for a clear-headed neighbor to step in and put things right. The floorboards complained something fierce when I fetched the poker, but a man’s obligation to sound financial stewardship must often rise above such petty disturbances.
