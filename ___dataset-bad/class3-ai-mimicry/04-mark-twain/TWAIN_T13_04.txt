Silas P. Grote stood there on that bustling corner, a self-made colossus planted amidst the scuttling of lesser men, and he took a deep, satisfying breath of the city’s coal-tinged air. He felt a grand pity for the poor devils who scurried past, their faces etched with a common sort of desperation he had long ago shed, for he was a man of substance, a man whose opinion carried the heft of gold bullion. It was a fine and private moment of triumph, a perfect jewel of self-regard—and then came Finnerty, smiling that thin, wicked smile of his. 'Silas, my friend,' he said, his voice just loud enough for the passing clerk and the newsboy to catch, 'I’ve just come from the receivership auction. I must say, they got a pitiful price for your wife's piano.' The whole towering edifice of Silas P. Grote’s importance swayed, groaned, and then came crashing down into a pile of miserable dust, right there on the public cobblestones.
