On the other side of that fence, though, was a whole country he hadn’t known existed until she’d come along, a place with a different kind of sunlight altogether. A body could get twisted up trying to figure the geometry of it all, believing one path must be abandoned for the other to be walked. But as the clock on the mantel ticked on with a peaceful sort of confidence, it struck him that maybe the fence wasn’t a prison wall at all. Perhaps it was just a gate, and a promise wasn’t about shutting things out, but about choosing who you had the honor of letting in.
