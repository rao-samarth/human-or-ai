I watched the Honorable Mr. Abernathy preen under the gaslights, puffing out his chest like a pouter pigeon and recounting the story of his own magnificent ascent. He spoke of deliberate choices and unflinching will, as if his life were a railroad he’d laid down spike by spike with his own two hands. A man might as well praise a cork for its cleverness in navigating a flood. He forgets—or perhaps never knew—the thousand invisible currents that nudged him along; the chance remark overheard in a barber shop, the sudden ague that laid up his chief competitor, the convenient inheritance from an aunt he hardly knew. We all fancy ourselves the pilots of our own grand vessels, charting a course through sheer grit, when the plain truth is we’re just so much driftwood, bobbing along on a tide we didn’t start and can’t stop, congratulating ourselves on the splendid view from whichever sandbar we happen to wash up on.
