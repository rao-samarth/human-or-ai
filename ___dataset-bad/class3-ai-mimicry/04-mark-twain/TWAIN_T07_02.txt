It has long been a settled matter in our part of the county that when a man of supposed importance—say, a postmaster whose chief virtue is the solemnity with which he cancels a stamp—decides upon a new rule for the public good, the public is expected to be good with it immediately. Our Mr. Gable had decreed, with the force of a man delivering gospel, that all mailboxes were to be elevated upon a post of precisely forty-two inches. He called it Standardization for the Advancement of Civilization, but what he meant was he had a sore back from bending. Well, the whole town grumbled and sawed and hammered their boxes into the sky, all except for old Widow Higgins. Her box remained stubbornly near the earth, nestled in her peonies like a hen on a nest. Mr. Gable would leave pointed notes about federal regulations, but the box never moved. A man with a uniform and a rulebook is a mighty thing, to be sure, but he is no match for a little old woman who has decided that civilization can just as well advance itself without her stooping to fetch the mail.
