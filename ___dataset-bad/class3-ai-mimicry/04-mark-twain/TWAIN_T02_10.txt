I will grant you this, sir—you have played the part of the respectable gentleman with a considerable and, I might say, an almost artistic flair. You’ve been parading about in a character as borrowed as that waistcoat, which I now suspect was paid for with funds of a rather imaginative origin. It must be a powerful strain on a man’s constitution, keeping all the particulars of his own invention straight in his head; why, it’s like trying to herd cats in a thunderstorm, I reckon, and a fellow is bound to get scratched by his own rascality sooner or later. You built a whole man out of smoke and brag, and for a time, I confess, the shape of him was quite convincing from a distance. But tell me this, now that the wind has blown the whole flimsy contraption away—who, in the name of all that’s genuine, is left standing there?
