I was minding my own business at the depot when a gentleman of some sixty years, who looked otherwise sound, began explaining a great and terrible conspiracy to the long-suffering woman beside him. He was not speaking of governments or banks, mind you, but of the structural integrity of a particular pigeon’s nest perched high in the iron rafters. He jabbed a finger toward it, his voice a low thunder that caused a nearby child to drop his licorice stick, and declared it a flagrant disregard for the fundamental principles of sound architecture. The whole affair, he insisted, was a deliberate act of shoddy craftsmanship—a public menace that would surely plummet at the most inconvenient moment. He had, he claimed, been observing the chief engineer of this project, a one-legged pigeon of dubious character, for three solid days, and had compiled a list of no less than seventeen violations. There ain’t nothing more certain or more deafening in all creation than a man who has found the one true flaw in the universe, especially when that flaw is a pile of twigs.
