It commenced with a remark of such monumental insignificance that a sleeping housefly would not have stirred itself to acknowledge it—something about the particular gait of a new mare tied to the hitching post. A trifling observation, you see, meant only to fill the empty air. But the owner of said mare, a man whose pride was evidently a more delicate and combustible substance than black powder, took it for a slight of the most pernicious and calculated variety. From that one misplaced syllable, a whole conflagration of accusation and counter-accusation was born right there in the dust of the public square. They fell to arguing, not about the horse anymore, for that poor creature was long forgotten, but about ancient business dealings, the character of their respective grandmothers, and other such matters vital to the immediate peace. The original spark was lost entirely in the smoke of a feud that would now, I reckon, outlive them both, and perhaps their children too. A man can build a bridge, but he can burn one down with a single word said sideways.
