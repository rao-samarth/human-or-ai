A man who wishes to comprehend the whole of human progress needs only to stand on a city street corner for five minutes and attempt to cross. I myself undertook this grand experiment, and I can report that the affair is a hopeless muddle. A drayman with a face like a sour beet was engaged in a one-sided argument with his mule—an animal of profound philosophical indifference; meanwhile, a streetcar conductor rang his bell with the furious piety of a man summoning sinners to judgment, though his only obstacle was a flock of society matrons who had stalled mid-street to dispute the merits of a new bonnet. Each party was absolutely convinced of its own supreme right-of-way, creating a magnificent, immovable knot of humanity and horsepower that brought all notions of enterprise to a dead halt. I saw then that government, and commerce, and all the grand schemes of men are nothing more than this: a traffic jam of vanities, where the loudest bell wins nothing and the most stubborn beast holds the day.
