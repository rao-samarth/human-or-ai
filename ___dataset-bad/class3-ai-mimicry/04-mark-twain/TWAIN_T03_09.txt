Old Man Hemlock, who’d sooner wrestle a bobcat for a penny than part with a dollar for his own funeral, went and did the most perplexing thing last Tuesday. You see, a rumor had got around—and in this town a rumor travels faster than bad news and is twice as welcome—that his prize-winning sow wasn’t quite the pedigree he’d claimed at the county fair. A lesser man might’ve just waited for the talk to die down, but not Hemlock. Well, sir, rather than suffer the mortal indignity of being known as the proprietor of a common pig, he took out a loan against his farm, a loan that’ll likely plague his children’s children, and bought the blue-ribbon boar from the next county over. He paraded that beast down Main Street like a conquering hero, looking for all the world like a man who's just saved his soul from damnation—though I reckon his soul was in a good deal less peril than his pocketbook. A man will mortgage his future to whitewash his present, and call it a sound investment every time.
