The conductor, a man whose spine had been previously acquainted only with the notion of a right angle, suddenly discovered a talent for bowing that would make a French courtier blush. “Henderson,” I says, keeping my voice low, “you watch this performance. A man could learn more about the workings of the world in these five minutes than in a year of Sunday sermons.” He grunted back, “He must have paid a king’s ransom for his passage.” “Not a bit of it,” I whispered. “He ain’t paid in dollars, he’s paid in broadcloth and boot-polish. That conductor ain’t looking at a ticket; he’s looking at a whole declaration of importance printed right on the man’s face, a document he learned to read before his own name. The rest of us might as well be sacks of potatoes.” And the gentleman in question? He accepts it all as if the Good Lord Himself had personally guaranteed his seat and shined his shoes that very morning.
