You’ve laid out your story piece by piece on this table, Henry, and I’ll admit it makes a handsome enough picture under the lamplight. You’ve polished every little fact until it shines, and you’ve arranged them so artfully a man might mistake it for the whole business; but a story ain’t just the bits you choose to tell, it’s the considerable parts you choose to bury. Why, you’ve built a mighty fine-looking fence around your account, to be sure—straight and whitewashed and pleasing to the eye—only it’s a fence built to hide a boneyard of what really took place. You haven't so much told a lie as you have conducted a quiet little funeral for what is so, and now you stand there in your black suit of sincerity expecting me to be chief mourner at the service. Well, I ain’t buying a plot. I’ve seen the corpse, and it ain’t resting peaceful.
