Well now, a man finds his conscience tested in the most peculiar ways, and mine was getting a thorough examination right there in the dust of Miller’s Crossing. Old Man Hemlock’s coin purse, fat as a prize hog and just as oblivious, lay by the hitching post where his buggy had stood not five minutes prior. Now, the part of me that sits in a church pew on Sunday—sweating and uncomfortable, but there all the same—knew the righteous path. It was a short path, too, leading straight to Hemlock’s door, where I’d receive a grunt for my honesty and nothing more. But there’s another part of a man, a more practical and considerably hungrier part, that does some quick and powerful ciphering. It calculates the difference between a miser’s hoard and a month of square meals, and it whispers that providence don’t always knock so politely. A fella could stand there all afternoon arguing with himself, weighing a clear soul against a full belly, and I reckon you know which side usually wins when the dinner bell is fixin' to ring and the pantry is bare.
