You misunderstand the whole business, my boy,” the old man said, tapping the ash from his cigarillo. “You see a man with a heavy gold watch-chain and a pleasant way of lying about his ancestors, and you figure he’s quality—that he’s climbed to the top rung of some great and important ladder. Well, it ain’t one ladder; it’s a whole parcel of them, all leaning against each other in a dark room, and most of them are slick with grease. The trick ain’t the climbing, you see. Any fool with enough coin can scramble up a few rungs and learn which fork to use. The genuine article is the man born so high up he don’t even know what a ladder *is*, and he’ll spend his whole life looking down his nose at the climbers for the sweat on their brow. It’s a grand and holy arrangement, designed by Providence to keep the ambitious busy and the comfortable comfortable, and it’s about as honest as a three-dollar bill.
