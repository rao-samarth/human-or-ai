You’re letting their whole counterfeit arrangement get the best of you, is the long and short of it. You see them strutting about in their fine clothes, judging a man by the shine on his boots or the pedigree of his grandfather’s horse, and you’ve worked yourself into a lather believing it’s the only gospel there is. Why, that’s just a flimsy set of rules for a game nobody with any real sand ought to want to play; it’s all folderol and ceremony, a grand illusion to keep themselves feeling important. You just keep to your own work—lay your bricks straight, speak your mind plain, and look a man in the eye—and you’ll find that a person of true substance creates his own weather. Let them have their stuffy rooms and their whispered nonsense; a fellow who builds something real will find the world beating a path to his door, not because he was invited, but because his house is the only one with a genuine light on inside.
