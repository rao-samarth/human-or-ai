The house made a noise—not one of its usual groans as it settled its old bones for the night, but a low, deliberate scrape from the vicinity of the front parlor. Now, a sensible man, upon hearing such a thing, would stay put and allow whoever was doing the scraping to finish their business and be on their way; there’s no profit in interrupting a determined scoundrel. And yet, there’s a peculiar tyranny in a sound you can’t place. It works on the nerves, you see, and breeds all manner of wild speculation until your imagination has furnished the downstairs with a whole congregation of villains. You lie there, calculating the odds and finding them disagreeable in the extreme, but the not-knowing is a worse itch than the fear itself. I’ve come to believe that what people mistake for a stout heart is often just a powerful case of impatience—a man gets so thoroughly agitated by the suspense that he’ll risk his neck just to find out what in tarnation is making all the racket.
