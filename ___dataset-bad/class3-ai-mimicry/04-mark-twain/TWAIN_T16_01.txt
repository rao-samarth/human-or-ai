I must report that the general theory of a man’s mettle being tested by imminent danger is mostly a lot of high-flown palaver. When our stagecoach lost a wheel on that miserable mountain pass—leaving us balanced over a drop that would turn a bishop to dust—the commotion was a sight to behold. A great, barrel-chested fellow who'd been regaling us with his wartime heroics began to wail for his mother, a truly pitiful sound. He made such a fuss, you’d think the predicament was invented purely for his own personal inconvenience. Meanwhile, our driver, a scrawny man who hadn't said more than two words the whole trip and was now pale as a corpse, simply climbed out onto the axle, calm as you please, and set to work with a wrench and some rope. He was trembling, I'll grant you, but his hands were steady on the task. It has a way of clarifying things, a thousand-foot drop; it separates the noise from the necessity right quick.
