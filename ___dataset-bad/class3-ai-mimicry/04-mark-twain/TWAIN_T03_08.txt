I once found myself rattling along in a stagecoach somewhere west of civilization, crammed between a fellow who smelled of pickled cabbage and another whose chief ambition was to see how much of my shoulder he could occupy without a formal introduction. The trouble started over something of no account whatsoever—a hatbox, I believe, belonging to a prim little man from back East with a face like a clenched fist. The driver, a man whose philosophy was carved from rawhide and tobacco juice, had tossed the thing unceremoniously atop the luggage pile. Well, you'd have thought he'd insulted the man's sainted mother and kicked his dog for good measure. The little man puffed up like a toad in a thunderstorm, demanding satisfaction, not for the hatbox, which was likely empty, but for the *principle* of the thing. It struck me then that a man will suffer any amount of genuine hardship—from heatstroke to highwaymen—but he will not suffer his own consequence to be questioned by a man who drives mules for a living. He would sooner be robbed blind than be made to look the fool, even if it’s his own foolishness that put him there in the first place.
