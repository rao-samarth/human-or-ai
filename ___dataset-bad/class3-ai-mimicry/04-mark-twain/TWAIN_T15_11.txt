The country quiet is a thing celebrated by poets, a blessed relief from the city’s clamor—and so it was, until that one particular noise commenced its tyranny. It was a cricket, you see, just one single, solitary fiend who had appointed himself the conductor of my damnation.

I would lie awake in the dark, my fists clenched, my teeth ground down to powder, while he sawed away on his one miserable note. A man can stand only so much. I rose from my bed, possessed by a cold and sacred fury, and seized the fireplace poker. The whole of creation had narrowed to that sound, and I would tear the house down to its foundations if it meant I could finally, blessedly, crush the life from its throat.
