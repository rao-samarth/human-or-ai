To hear those two fellows jawing at the next table, you'd think they personally instructed the sun when to rise and the river when to swell. Every scrap of their supposed success, which they lay out like a new suit of clothes, is credited to their own magnificent foresight and iron-willed decisions; a man would get the idea they were born with a map of their own lives already tucked in their fists. The plain fact of it is they are no more in command of their journey than a tumbleweed is in command of the wind that blows it. Each man is just the tail-end of a long, long string of happenings—a bad meal his grandfather ate, a horse that threw a shoe a hundred miles away, a particular slant of rain that soured a neighbor's crop and not his own. And when the poor fool lands in a soft patch of clover instead of a briar patch, he stands up, dusts himself off, and calls the whole ridiculous accident a matter of character.
