Henderson fixed me with a stare of such profound gravity a man might employ before confessing he’d single-handedly lost a war. He then proceeded to account for the regrettable incident involving my new steam-powered tiller, unwinding a tale of such bewildering architecture that a sane man would get a headache just trying to map its foundations. The fault, he insisted, belonged to a wayward goat which had, with supernatural cunning, unlatched the shed door; yet this same goat was, by his own earlier account, known for an intellect so dim it often mistook a fence post for a rival. This criminal enterprise coincided—by some miracle of poor timing—with a visiting preacher’s bout of hiccups and a sudden hailstorm composed of stones the size of a fist. He spoke with the desperate sincerity of a man trying to patch a leaking dam with a fishing net, and I confess his explanation was so gloriously, so intricately and preposterously false, that it ceased to be a lie and became a species of poetry.
