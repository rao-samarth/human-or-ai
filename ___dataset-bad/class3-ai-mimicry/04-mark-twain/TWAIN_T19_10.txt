The whole panorama slid past the carriage window, a picture of God-fearing prosperity and contentment if ever there was one. You saw the white-washed farmhouses, so neat they looked to be scrubbed with a toothbrush; you saw the sturdy-looking barns and the fields of corn standing as tall and proud as soldiers on parade—and a finer lie you never did see. For the truth was, that soil was but a thumb’s-width deep over a bed of stubborn clay; the proprietor of that grandest barn owed his soul to a banker in the city; and the smiles on those faces were stretched thin to hide the worry of a coming drought. It is a powerful thing, a coat of fresh paint, for it can make a tombstone look like a milestone if the sun hits it just so. A man could travel that line for a year and believe he was passing through paradise, never once suspecting that the whole enterprise was held together by hope and a promissory note.
