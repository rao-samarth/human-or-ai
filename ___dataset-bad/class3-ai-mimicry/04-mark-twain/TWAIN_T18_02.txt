It was declared by the senior partners that the new iron safe—a behemoth of security and presumed financial stability—must be relocated from the vestibule to the main office, a distance of no more than thirty paces. And so a committee was formed, for in any enterprise where one strong back might suffice, the conflicting wisdom of three or four weak minds is always preferred. Mr. Abernathy, a man whose chief acquaintance with mechanics was winding his own pocket watch, argued passionately for a system of Egyptian rollers; meanwhile, young Perkins, fresh from some college, insisted upon a scientific application of levers and fulcrums, sketching diagrams upon a dusty crate that no one could decipher. The inevitable result of this intellectual collision was that both methods were attempted at once—a compromise which satisfied no one but which succeeded magnificently in lodging the great iron box squarely in the central doorway. There it sat, an immovable monument to cooperative idiocy, trapping the bookkeepers on one side and the executives on the other, bringing all commerce to a more profound and immediate halt than any financial panic could ever hope to achieve.
