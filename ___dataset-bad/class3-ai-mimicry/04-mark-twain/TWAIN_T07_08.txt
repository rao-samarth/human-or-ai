Mrs. Abernathy, who ran the Civic Propriety Committee with the kind of iron-fisted benevolence that makes a man want to take up sinning for a hobby, decreed that all front-garden flowers were to be white. It was for Purity, she said, and for Harmony—two things our town had precious little of until she started manufacturing them herself. Most folks just grumbled into their coffee, seeing as it's a powerful nuisance to argue with a woman who believes she's on a first-name basis with Providence. But then old Widow Gable, who hadn't spoken more than two words in a row since her husband passed, went and planted a row of the most scandalously red poppies you ever did see, right where the mailman and God himself couldn't miss them. That was the crack in the dam. The next morning, the Perkins's yard was a riot of devilish orange marigolds, and by the end of the week, the whole of Elm Street looked like a painter’s fever dream. It was a silent sort of revolution, fought with shovels and seed packets, proving that while you can legislate propriety all you want, you can’t, it turns out, serve a warrant on a zinnia.
