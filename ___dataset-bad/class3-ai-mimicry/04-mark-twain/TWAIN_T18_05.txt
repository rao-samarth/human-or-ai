You ask for the plain facts, sir, and the plain facts you shall have, though they possess a character so altogether bewildering that reason herself would blush to acknowledge them. I was instructed to do one thing: to ensure Mrs. Albright's cat did not interfere with the cucumber judging. A simple enough enterprise. Yet, I did not calculate on young Billy Peterson’s experimental sky-rocket, which chose that precise moment to ignite prematurely—a faulty fuse, he claims—and describe an arc not toward the heavens but directly into Henderson’s pigsty. The ensuing stampede, a truly biblical spectacle of panicked swine, upset the very table upon which I had secured the cat’s carrier. From there, the animal, liberated by the sheer force of the calamity and possessed of a demon’s own fury, proceeded to make a new and terrible science out of the ruination of prize-winning vegetables. I merely provided the first, wholly innocent, link in a chain of disaster forged by a boy’s ambition and a pig’s terror.
