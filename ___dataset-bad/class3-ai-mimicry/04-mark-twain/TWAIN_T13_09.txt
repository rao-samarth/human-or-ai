There comes a point in a man’s life, particularly in a town so small its chief export is idle gossip, when he discovers he has become a ghost. Old Judge Hemlock, who for thirty years could quiet the town square with a single thunderous clearing of his throat, now found that his pronouncements on the weather were met with the same vacant deference as a dog’s bark. He had built his standing in our little community brick by careful brick, a monumental thing he figured would stand against the ages; but he had not accounted for the simple erosion of time, which pays no mind to a man’s estimation of himself. And the Judge, once a mighty pillar of local society, now found himself a mere porch post, watching the world carry on its business as if his solemn judgments were no longer required for its rotation. The humiliation wasn't in some grand public failure, no, but in the slow, creeping realization that the world had simply forgotten to ask him what he thought.
