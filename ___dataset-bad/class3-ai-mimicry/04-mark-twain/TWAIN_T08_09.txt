I wish you could have seen the spectacle at the Governor’s affair last evening. There was Mr. Abernathy, a man who built his fortune on the ruins of others, swelled up with piety and roast beef, accepting compliments on his Christian charity. And across the room stood Miller, the very fellow Abernathy had bankrupted in a deal so slick and legal it was practically blessed by a court of law, looking as hollowed-out as a gourd in November. Now, all these fine people in their starched collars would tell you the matter is settled; that the ledgers have been balanced by a man in a black robe, and that is the end of it. But I saw the look in Miller’s eye. He wasn’t calculating what the law might allow—he was weighing his own soul against the satisfaction of seeing Abernathy get a different sort of reckoning, one that ain’t delivered by a clerk. They preach that a man must turn his cheek, but they never seem to mention what he ought to do once he’s run out of cheeks to turn.
