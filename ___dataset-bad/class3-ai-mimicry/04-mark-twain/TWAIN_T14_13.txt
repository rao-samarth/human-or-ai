My sister’s boy, a strapping lad with more certainty than years, was laying out the precise map of his own life for all of us at the supper table. He spoke of his decisions and his ironclad will as if he were the sole captain of a ship on a painted ocean; every port of call was of his own choosing, every wind a servant to his sails. My brother-in-law listened with that placid look he reserves for harmless tomfoolery, much like a man watching a child build a fortress of sand just as the tide is beginning to turn. The boy imagines he is charting a course, and a fine and noble notion it is—but he has not yet made the acquaintance of the current, that silent and indifferent partner in every man’s voyage which has its own peculiar ideas about the final destination, and which has never yet lost an argument.
