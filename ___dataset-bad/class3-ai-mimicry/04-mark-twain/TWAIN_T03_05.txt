There are certain slights a man of standing simply cannot abide, especially when they are hollered across a street so thick with humanity and horse-drawn traffic that you’d think a private insult would be swallowed up and digested by the general clamor. A fellow with a face like a wilted turnip saw fit to levy an accusation concerning the true parentage of a five-cent cigar I had sold him, and he did it in a voice that carried over the clang of the streetcar bell. Now, a lesser man might have let it pass, but I felt the eyes of a thousand strangers upon my very soul, judging the fiber of my character right then and there. What followed was a scuffle of some minor note—a lamentable tearing of my best Sunday waistcoat, to say nothing of the indignity—which concluded with a night in the city lock-up and a fine that amounted to a week’s wages. But my good name, you see, was scrubbed clean as a parson's collar, and that is a bargain at any price—a fact which any man of substance, or any man who wishes to be one, would readily understand.
