My second day in Lisbon, I began documenting the room. It wasn't about theft, but about a subtle, persistent sense of displacement. I started with a photograph of the nightstand before leaving for the morning: notepad squared to the lamp base, pen precisely parallel. Upon my return, the pen was angled a few degrees to the left. Insignificant, of course. A simple consequence of the cleaning staff's work. Yet, I found myself unable to dismiss it. The next day, I expanded the protocol to include the toiletries in the bathroom and the fold of the decorative bed runner. My sightseeing itinerary was soon forgotten, replaced by a more urgent cartography of my temporary living space. Each evening became a quiet, methodical comparison of my 'before' photos with the 'after' reality, a meticulous search for tiny, meaningless shifts that had somehow become the entire purpose of my trip.
