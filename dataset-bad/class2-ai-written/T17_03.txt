The whole thing started at the diner, over a chipped coffee mug and a harmless remark about the sagging porch on the old Miller place. He’d only meant the house, the peeling paint and the way the gutters were choked with last autumn’s leaves. But Clara Miller’s nephew was in the next booth and heard only his family’s name paired with the word “neglect.” The correction never had a chance to catch up to the story. By Sunday, the whispers had traveled from the pews of the church to the aisles of the grocery store. People he had known his whole life suddenly found their shoes fascinating when he walked by. A nod that was once warm became brief, a shared morning greeting was left hanging in the empty air. He never understood the exact moment the tide turned, only that a single, poorly aimed sentence had somehow quietly and completely unmoored him from the only town he’d ever called home.
