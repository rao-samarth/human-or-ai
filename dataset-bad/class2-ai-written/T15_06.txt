No, I’m not “overthinking it,” so you can just stop right there. For two solid years, the guy in 3B has put his recycling out on Tuesday nights. Not Monday, not Wednesday. Tuesday. Always between 9:15 and 9:22 PM. You could set a very sad, very suburban watch by it. But last night? 9:34. And he only put out the plastics bin. No paper. Where’s the paper, Mark? People don’t just stop generating paper. Is he shredding? Burning it? It’s not normal. Normal people have a consistent and disappointing paper trail. So, yes, fine, I took a quick look when he went back inside. You’re acting like I committed a felony. It was just a glance. Do you have any idea how many single-serving yogurt containers one man can go through in a week? It’s statistically alarming, and frankly, it points to a profound emotional instability.
