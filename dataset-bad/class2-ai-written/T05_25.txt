My uncle raises his glass, proposing a toast to tradition, and a chorus of agreement echoes through the dining room. Daniel, sitting beside me, squeezes my hand under the table, a familiar, comforting pressure that I’m supposed to cherish. Everyone here sees us as the inevitable conclusion, the perfect match they all hoped for. He is stability and sense, a future mapped out in clean, straight lines. Yet, my thoughts keep drifting back to a crowded bookstore two nights ago, to a conversation about impossible things with someone who sees the world in chaotic, brilliant color. That memory feels more real than the solid weight of Daniel’s hand in mine. I offer a weak smile to my grandmother across the table, feeling the pull of their collective expectation like a physical weight, a carefully constructed cage I helped build myself.
