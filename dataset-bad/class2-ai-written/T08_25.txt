Look, I understand the impulse. What you're describing isn't about restoring balance; it's about personal satisfaction. It's about making *him* feel what *we* felt. And in that moment, we're no longer seeking a fair outcome. We're just inflicting an equal and opposite wound, and that doesn't fix the original damage. The goal should be to mend the system he broke, to re-establish a principle that's bigger than our own anger. This requires a cold, methodical approach, not the heat of retribution. The minute we make this about evening the score, we've already lost the moral high ground. We simply become the next person to decide that our pain gives us the right to cause it in others.
