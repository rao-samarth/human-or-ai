You haven’t left this room in three days, Alex. The plates I brought you are still by the door, the coffee has gone cold. He didn’t even turn from the wall, a chaotic web of newspaper clippings and red yarn that now covered every inch of plaster. “It’s not about the coffee, Sarah,” he murmured, his voice raspy with disuse. “It’s about the timing.” He gestured wildly with a trembling hand toward a cluster of articles. “The frequency of the train arrivals, the migration patterns of the birds I told you about, even the flickering of that streetlamp—it’s all a pulse. A message.” She took a step back, the sheer, frantic certainty in his eyes more terrifying than any argument. This wasn’t just a project anymore; this was a fever. He was somewhere else entirely, a place she couldn’t follow, and he was beckoning her toward a cliff she couldn’t see.
