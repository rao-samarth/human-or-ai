In a town like ours, where memory is the closest thing we have to currency, the weight of an unexamined word can be immense. It began with a simple instruction, left on a sticky note amid the quiet dust of the library archives: "Deal with the old town records." To one, it meant carefully cataloging the fragile, leather-bound ledgers. To another, it was a practical directive to clear space, to make way for the modern. No one sought clarification; the assumption was a bridge built of air, and everyone walked across it with perfect confidence. By the time the shredding trucks had departed, a silence had fallen over Main Street, a quiet deeper than the one between the library shelves. We had not merely lost paper and ink. We had misplaced our own origin story, trading a century of documented truth for the hollow echo of what we thought someone else had meant. The empty space on the shelves became a monument not to progress, but to the devastating power of a single, ambiguous phrase.
