The silence in the open-plan office was absolute, broken only by Brenda’s soft whimpers from atop her ergonomic chair. All eyes were fixed on the arachnid monstrosity clinging to the wall above the Keurig, a creature so hairy it looked like it was wearing a tiny toupee. This was it. This was my moment. I saw Sandra from marketing watching, her face a mask of primal terror, and something shifted inside me. Ignoring the frantic pounding in my chest, I grabbed an empty tissue box from my desk. My approach was a masterpiece of stealth, each step measured as if the floor were mined. I could feel the collective gaze of my colleagues burning into my back. Just a little closer. With a sudden, slightly pathetic yelp, I lunged and slammed the box against the wall. A muffled cheer went up. Victory! I held the box there, breathing heavily, a champion. Only then did the horrifying reality dawn on me: I now had to *move* the box, and I had absolutely no follow-up plan for a live, and likely very angry, spider in a cardboard prison.
