Stan had his hands on his hips, a smirk of authority fixed on his face as he circled the stalled minivan. "It's the alternator," he announced to the small audience of waiting customers, his voice booming with decades of unearned certainty inside the concrete garage. "I've heard that particular whine a thousand times. These new mechanics, they need a computer to tell them what day it is. I just need my ears." He tapped his temple knowingly, enjoying the nods from his regulars. Just then, the owner's nephew, a quiet kid in a hoodie, shuffled forward and plugged a small, black device into the dashboard port. The silence was broken only by a few soft beeps. "It's a faulty crankshaft position sensor," the kid mumbled, not even looking up from his screen. Stan's smirk faltered, then vanished completely. The sudden clatter of a dropped wrench from the next bay over sounded like a thunderclap in the now-awkward quiet. Every eye shifted from the kid's glowing screen to Stan's suddenly pale, grease-smudged face, watching the town's expert become a fool in the space of a single, quiet sentence.
