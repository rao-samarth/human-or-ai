The plan was simple, foolproof even: meet by the big equestrian statue in the main square. It's a classic romantic travel move. Except, apparently, this particular city's entire historical identity is built on immortalizing dead guys on horses, and the "main square" had four of them. I, of course, picked the one with the most pompous-looking general and waited for nearly two hours while my phone battery ceremoniously died. When she finally found me, radiating pure fury, it turned out she'd been waiting by the slightly-less-pompous king statue across the plaza. She insisted she had specified "the one near the fountain," a detail I have no recollection of. I distinctly remember "the one facing the cathedral." The rest of our supposedly idyllic vacation became a masterclass in weaponized silence, a truly unforgettable experience built on the solid foundation of who stood where.
