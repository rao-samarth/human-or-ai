The sawdust is gone, and the Millers’ new porch gleams under the afternoon sun. White railings, perfect and clean. I can see them from my kitchen window, a constant, bright landmark of everything we haven't done. *How?* That's the question that sticks in my throat. We work just as hard, punch the same clocks, but our own front steps are soft with rot. A quiet suspicion starts to curl in my stomach whenever I see his new truck parked in their pristine driveway. It feels like there’s some secret, some shortcut they found that we missed. Every laugh I hear from their yard sounds a little too loud, a little bit pointed, as if the whole town is celebrating something I'm not a part of.
