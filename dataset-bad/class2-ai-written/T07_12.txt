The nightly address was supposed to start in five minutes, which meant the speaker grille in the ceiling would soon start humming. They’d installed them in every home last year for 'civic unity.' The voice of the Chancellor, smooth and unavoidable, would soon fill every room, talking about productivity and our shared purpose. But I'd found the flaw in their perfect system a few months back. I slid the vinyl from its sleeve—a pre-digital recording my dad had hidden away—and set it carefully on the turntable. The needle hissed for a moment, then found the groove. A scratchy, forbidden melody from some forgotten band began to unspool into the quiet air. It wasn't loud enough to be heard outside, or even in the next room, really. It was just for me. They could own the airwaves, but they couldn't own the little pocket of silence right here, and tonight, that silence was mine to fill with whatever I wanted.
