The crickets are starting their evening racket, a sound my neighbor calls the "true music" of the land. He's always talking about unplugging, about rejecting the hollow promises of a hyper-connected world for something more authentic. I saw him this morning, looking perfectly rugged in his brand-new overalls, filming a video for his followers about the spiritual purity of growing your own food. It was almost convincing. Then came the drone. A high-pitched whine that cut through the birdsong, as a sleek quadcopter from some same-day delivery service descended to deposit a tiny, eco-friendly box of imported quinoa right on his porch. He just gave the machine a little thumbs-up from his rocking chair. Apparently, the authentic, off-grid lifestyle is now fully automated and comes with live tracking.
