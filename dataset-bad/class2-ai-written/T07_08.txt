The official letterhead on my desk felt thin, almost translucent under the lamplight. They called it ‘standardizing the historical narrative,’ a neat, clean phrase for what they were actually asking. Just a few edits, they said, to align the archives with the new civic vision. It would be so easy to comply. A few keystrokes, a quiet upload, and my life would continue undisturbed, my position secure. But I kept thinking of the files I’d spent months with, the originals tucked away in the climate-controlled vault. I saw the smudged ink from a hesitant signature, the margin notes about a bad harvest, the names of people who couldn’t write their own but whose existence was marked by a clerk. Erasing those inconvenient, messy details felt like a second, deeper kind of death. Slowly, I moved the mouse and dragged their approved template to the trash icon. Let them build their clean, simple version on their own servers. This one, the true one, would be mine to protect.
