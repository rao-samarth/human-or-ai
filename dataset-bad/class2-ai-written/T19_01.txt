For my first six months here, I was completely convinced that Mark was some kind of corporate superhero. He had this unflappable calm in every meeting, an answer for every impossible question, and a perfectly organized desk that made mine look like a disaster zone. He was the standard I was trying to reach, this polished professional who had everything under control. Then I happened to walk past the quiet stairwell near the parking garage last Tuesday and heard him on the phone. His voice was low and tight, and he was telling someone he didn't know how he was going to make payroll and was terrified of letting everyone down. It was like seeing a statue suddenly start to breathe. In that one moment, the perfect, unshakeable boss vanished, and all I could see was a guy who was just as scared as the rest of us.
