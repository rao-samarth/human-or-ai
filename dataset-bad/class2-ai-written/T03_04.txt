The owner of the small guesthouse gestured toward the hairline crack in the wooden countertop, his expression more disappointed than angry. It would have been simple to pay the small, disputed charge. The fifty euros was an annoyance, not a crisis, and would have ended the conversation, allowing him to catch his train with time to spare. Yet, he found himself methodically pulling up the dated check-in photos on his phone, carefully zooming in on the same faint line he had noted upon arrival. The transaction wasn't about the money anymore; it had become about the public record and the quiet accusation of negligence hanging in the air. He couldn't stand the idea of a future traveler reading a review that painted him as careless or deceitful. So he stood there, calmly presenting his evidence, sacrificing the quiet morning he had planned for the far less tangible goal of leaving with his integrity unchallenged.
