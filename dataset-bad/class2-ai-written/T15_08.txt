My cousin’s laughter echoed from the kitchen, a bright sound that seemed to come from another room, another world entirely. Someone asked me a question—I think it was about my new apartment—but the words dissolved before they reached me. My focus had narrowed to the dining table. The dark whorls in the wood grain were no longer just patterns; they were pathways, a complex map I needed to solve. My fork lay forgotten. I started tracing one particularly deep line with my gaze, following its jagged journey from a knot near the salt shaker toward the edge. It was imperative that I see where it ended. If I could just follow this one, without my vision blurring, maybe the tightness in my chest would finally ease. “…right, Sarah?” My uncle was looking at me, his smile expectant. I blinked, forcing a small nod. “Yes, of course.” The conversation moved on, but my eyes drifted back, searching for the place where I had lost the trail.
