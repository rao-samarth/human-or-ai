Clara, you would not believe the performance unfolding at the table next to me. I'm at ‘The Daily Grind,’ trying to get some work done, but I'm completely distracted. This couple, probably my age, is loudly lamenting the grip of consumer culture on society. They're talking about minimalism and ethical living, about how we're all just cogs in a machine designed to make us buy things we don't need. It's quite the passionate speech. The only problem is that he's delivering it from behind a brand new laptop with a very prominent fruit logo, and she just set down a handbag that probably costs more than my rent. They’re sipping five-dollar lattes and planning their weekend trip to an exclusive yoga retreat. Honestly, their commitment to rejecting materialism is so beautifully packaged, I almost feel inspired to buy it.
