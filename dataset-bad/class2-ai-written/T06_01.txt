The applause for Anna felt distant, a muffled sound from another room. While everyone else smiled and nodded, a cold, heavy knot formed in my stomach. It wasn't that she didn't deserve the recognition for landing the new client; her presentation had been flawless. But hearing the director praise her "innate talent" made my own long hours of methodical work suddenly feel clumsy and pointless. I looked down at my own notepad, at the ideas I had thought were promising just that morning, and they now seemed childish. A quiet, bitter question surfaced: was her success somehow a direct comment on my failure? I found myself replaying our recent interactions, searching for a sign that I had been falling behind, that my own position was less secure than I had believed. The clapping finally faded, but the hollow space it left inside me only grew.
