The drone of the dryers filled the humid laundromat, a steady hum beneath the man’s quiet voice. His tone was a careful blend of concern and disappointment as he told the story. “He just exploded,” he said, shaking his head slowly, “completely unprovoked.” I kept my eyes on the sweater I was folding, but my ears were burning.

The woman beside him, Chloe, folded a small t-shirt and her brow furrowed with sympathy for the storyteller. My hands paused over a warm towel. Do I interrupt? Do I become the meddling stranger who unravels a perfectly constructed narrative right here among the lint traps and bleach fumes? Or do I just let this carefully planted seed of doubt take root, knowing I could have so easily pulled it out?
