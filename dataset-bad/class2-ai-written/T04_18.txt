The voice from the next table is so earnest, trying to convince not just his friend, but himself. “It’s not a betrayal, it’s just an opportunity.” I almost want to lean over and tell the other guy, the quiet one staring into his soda, that this is how it starts. It begins with a single, perfectly reasonable decision that happens to benefit only one of them, wrapped in assurances that nothing will truly change. The promises are still there, of course, but they get quieter, stretched thin over new time zones and different priorities, until they're little more than faint echoes you can barely recall. I push a stray piece of ice around my cup with a straw, the plastic scraping against the bottom. People don’t usually leave with a bang; they just slowly stop being present, their loyalty redirected by the simple, gravitational pull of a more convenient life. That’s the real test, isn’t it? Not the dramatic fights, but the slow, silent drift when one person’s map suddenly shows a completely different destination.
