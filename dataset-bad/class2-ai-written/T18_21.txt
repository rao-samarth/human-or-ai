I was feeling so self-satisfied, zipping through the countryside on this high-speed train, feeling like a seasoned traveler. All I wanted was sparkling water. I rehearsed the phrase, pointed with what I thought was suave confidence, and ended up with a pressurized tube of what I now know is artisanal fig jam. My pride wouldn't let me question the transaction. Back in my seat, a slight squeeze was all it took for a jet of thick, brown goo to erupt with surprising velocity, decorating my shirt and the pristine white blazer of the businessman beside me. There was a frozen moment of pure horror. He stared at the glob on his lapel, then at my face, and a slow, rumbling laugh started in his chest. I realized then that this ridiculous, sticky incident, not some carefully curated photo, would be the actual souvenir from this trip.
