The vixen appeared at the edge of the woods just after dusk, same as always. I had started by leaving out scraps, then a proper bowl of meat, and now my entire evening revolved around her arrival. She was mine. I knew this with a certainty that felt sharper than reason. Tonight, though, she paused, her head cocked toward the Henderson’s property line. A dog barked, a friendly yip from their new golden retriever. A cold knot tightened in my gut. That dog was a threat, an intrusion into this perfect, quiet ritual we had established. Before I could process the thought, I was walking toward my shed, my hand already closing around the handle of the old spade leaning against the wall. I stopped, my breath catching in the cool air, the metal cold against my skin. What was I doing? It’s just an animal. But the thought of her being scared away, or worse, felt like a physical violation, a theft of something I couldn’t bear to lose.
