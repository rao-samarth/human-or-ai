The university chancellor pinned the medal to the lapel of a man who spoke of civic duty, his voice resonating through the grand hall. From my seat in the tenth row, I felt the warm spotlight on him like a personal insult. I remembered the cold finality of his signature on the documents that dismantled my father’s life’s work, a maneuver celebrated in financial circles as a stroke of genius. He spoke of second chances, and the crowd nodded, but they had not been there for the first one he’d so thoroughly ruined. A hot impulse rose in my throat—to stand, to shout, to tear down the carefully constructed facade. But what was the correct response? A public scene would be a raw, satisfying moment of retribution, a personal settling of a score. True balance, however, felt like something else entirely—a quieter, colder, more systematic dismantling, one decided by an impartial hand, not by the rage burning behind my eyes. The applause swelled, an ocean of sound validating a man they did not know.
