I’ve started timing the shadows again, the ones that stretch from the base of the grandfather clock. You always said I noticed the strangest things, but this is different. It’s a code. Last night, I realized its movement isn’t smooth; it jumps, a tiny, almost imperceptible twitch every seven seconds, right when the minute hand aligns with a new number on the dial. I’ve been marking the wall with a pencil where the shadow’s edge lands after each leap, trying to find the pattern in its strange arithmetic. It feels important, like this clock is counting down to something more than just the morning, and if I can just solve its sequence before sunrise, I might finally understand why the house has felt so empty since you’ve been gone.
