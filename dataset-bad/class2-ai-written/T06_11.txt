The clinking of cutlery on porcelain is the only sound that seems to cut through the practiced murmur of the ballroom. I watch her from across the table, effortlessly charming the investors, her laugh a bright, clear note that makes heads turn. It’s always been so easy for her, everything just falling perfectly into place while the rest of us struggle. I smooth a non-existent wrinkle from my dress, suddenly feeling like a child playing dress-up in borrowed clothes. She probably didn't spend weeks agonizing over her presentation, losing sleep over every single data point. A bitter taste fills my mouth as I watch her accept a compliment with that modest, practiced tilt of her head. I wonder what corner she cut, what little secret she holds that makes the universe bend so consistently in her favor.
