The mandate from leadership was clear: all project updates were to be logged in the new central dashboard. It was a redundant, clunky system, but it offered executives a single, clean overview, which was the entire point. The development team, however, simply did not adopt it. There was no formal meeting or declared opposition; they just continued to use their own proven, internal trackers and communicated progress directly within their established channels. When questioned, individual members would offer polite apologies about the learning curve or the time required to migrate old data. This created a fascinating stalemate. Management possessed the formal power to enforce the rule, but the team held the functional power, as their collective, silent refusal rendered the expensive new software completely useless. The dashboard remained pristine and empty, a monument to an authority that existed only on paper.
