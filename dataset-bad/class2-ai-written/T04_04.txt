The clinking of champagne flutes felt a million miles away as Mr. Harrison laid out the promotion. His voice was a low hum against the ballroom's chatter, detailing a future I had only dreamed of. It was everything I'd been working for, with one small, ugly condition: I'd have to frame the recent project's success as my initiative, quietly sidelining Maya. My eyes drifted across the room to where she was, laughing with some of the junior staff, completely unaware of the deal being brokered at her expense. We had spent months on that project, fueled by takeout coffee and a shared belief we could pull it off. In that moment, watching her, the memory of that shared struggle felt more substantial than any title he could offer. The promotion felt hollow. I turned back to Harrison with a polite smile, knowing that some lines, once crossed, can never be uncrossed.
