"Watch this," Leo said, palm flat, a perfectly smooth, grey stone resting in its center. "It’s all in the wrist. You need the right angle, the right spin. I used to get at least seven skips, easy." He gave Sarah a confident smirk, the kind that expected applause before the act was even done. He drew his arm back, a practiced, fluid motion meant to impress. The stone left his hand with a flick, but instead of skimming the water's glassy surface, it arced high, wobbled comically in the air, and plopped into the pond with a dull, ignominious *gloop*, barely a foot from the bank. The ripples spread out like a slow, silent laugh. Sarah didn’t say anything for a moment, just bit her lip to hide a smile. "Seven, you said?" she asked, her voice light and airy. Leo just stared at the spot where his stone had vanished, the blood rising in his cheeks, hotter than the afternoon sun.
