The little six-wheeled delivery bot was having a crisis of purpose on the corner of 5th and Elm. Its programming, apparently scrambled by a nearby transit hub’s magnetic interference, had identified a department store mannequin as the intended recipient of a lukewarm bean burrito. The bot would roll back precisely three feet, whir for a moment, and then charge the plate-glass window with unwavering determination, thumping uselessly against the barrier. A small crowd had formed, offering a chorus of unhelpful advice. “Angle it more to the left!” a woman with a poodle suggested. The store’s security guard, a man clearly unprepared for a robotic siege, simply stood with his arms crossed, watching the automated assailant repeatedly fail its mission. The blinking lights on the machine seemed less like an error message and more like a plea for someone, anyone, to just take the burrito.
