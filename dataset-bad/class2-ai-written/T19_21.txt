You’re waving that little receipt around as if it's some grand confession I signed in ink. I can see the whole narrative you’ve constructed behind your eyes: the clandestine meeting, the whispered secrets, the betrayal. It’s a compelling story, I’ll give you that. What you can't picture is the sheer, bone-deep exhaustion of a canceled late-night flight, or the fluorescent hum of a last-minute lobby booking because it was just closer than driving two hours through a storm. It was just easier. You’ve chosen the more dramatic version because it confirms what you were already looking for, a crack in the foundation. The truth is boring; it’s just logistics and bad weather. But that choice, that need to find the worst in a simple inconvenience, says far more about you than this flimsy piece of paper ever could about me.
