The request from Barry, the new IT lead, was admittedly terse. "We need fifty mice by Friday, can you handle it?" he’d typed to the new intern, Chloe. Anxious to prove her initiative, she didn't bother asking for clarification on model numbers or suppliers. She simply found a highly-rated local vendor who could handle a bulk order on short notice. The fallout arrived in a large, poorly ventilated van precisely during the quarterly visit from the regional director. Four large crates of living, breathing, and aggressively squeaking rodents were wheeled into the main lobby. Chloe beamed with pride at her resourcefulness while Barry looked as if he was about to faint into the ficus plant. The company was now the proud owner of a small mammal colony, the director was utterly bewildered, and everyone in the department still had to share their old, sticky computer peripherals.
