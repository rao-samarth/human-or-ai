The barista, a young man with a single, mournful-looking feather tattooed on his forearm, pointed a reclaimed-wood stick at the sprawling wall menu. “First,” he intoned, as if revealing ancient secrets, “you must select your bean’s origin story, then the specific extraction method.” He gestured to a diagram that looked suspiciously like a high school chemistry chart. The small woman in the floral-print blouse squinted. “I’ll just have a regular coffee, dear. Medium.” A subtle, tense silence fell over the queue. The barista’s professional smile tightened. “We don’t really do ‘regular’ here, ma’am. It’s an artisanal journey. Perhaps a flash-chilled aeropress from our Yirgacheffe harvest?” The woman patted her large handbag with a decisive snap. “Does it taste like coffee?” He nodded slowly, his eyes pleading. “Then that one. In a medium cup. To go.” He looked utterly defeated, as if she had just demanded he pour the Mona Lisa into a travel mug, and the man behind her had to turn away to hide his laughter.
