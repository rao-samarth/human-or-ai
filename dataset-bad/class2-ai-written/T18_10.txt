The plan, conceived over artisanal coffee in the city, was simple: build a charming rustic chicken coop. Armed with a confusing online tutorial and a pile of reclaimed wood, Arthur spent the entire weekend hammering and sawing under the placid gaze of his new neighbor's cows. The final structure leaned at an angle that defied conventional geometry, with a door that wouldn't quite close and a roof that seemed more optimistic than functional. Nevertheless, he proudly introduced his four new hens to their avant-garde home. They took one look, immediately discovered a gap he'd overlooked near the base—a gap precisely the size of a chicken—and made a beeline for the perfectly manicured lawn next door. Arthur could only watch, hands on his hips, as his flock began methodically pecking the petals off Mrs. Gable's prize-winning roses, a scene of serene, pastoral vandalism.
