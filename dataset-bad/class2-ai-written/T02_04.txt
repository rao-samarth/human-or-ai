Mark felt the blood drain from his face as Cynthia turned to him, her smile a terrifyingly bright slash in the dim conference room. "Mark, you're our numbers guru. What's your read on these regression models?" He stared at the slide, a chaotic squiggle of lines that looked like a toddler's first attempt at drawing spaghetti. For three weeks, he had survived on a steady diet of confident nods and phrases like "let's circle back" and "synergistic alignment." Now, the moment of reckoning had arrived. He cleared his throat, buying a precious second. "Well, Cynthia," he began, his voice a shockingly steady baritone, "what we're seeing here is a clear leveraging of our core vertical assets against a downstream paradigm shift." A few people nodded thoughtfully. He saw his manager, Dave, even jot it down. Mark pressed on, emboldened. "The key takeaway is that the algorithm's k-means clustering is… suboptimal for this data set. We need to pivot." He had no idea what any of that meant, but he said it with the certainty of a man who did. The silence stretched, and then Cynthia beamed. "Excellent insight, Mark. Exactly what I was thinking."
