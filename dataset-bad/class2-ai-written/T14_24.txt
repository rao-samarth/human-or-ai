You’re looking at me like I meticulously designed this whole disaster from the start. But that’s not how it works, is it? You don’t get a blueprint. You just react. A memo lands on your desk, a phone call comes in the middle of the night, an offer is made that you can’t ignore. Each step seems small, logical, even necessary at the time. It’s only when you stop and look back, from a place like this, that you see the pattern emerge all on its own. By then, you're already here. You can’t un-sign the papers or un-make the call. To pretend you would have done anything different, that you would have seen the whole picture from the first move… that’s just a comforting lie we tell ourselves so we can sleep.
