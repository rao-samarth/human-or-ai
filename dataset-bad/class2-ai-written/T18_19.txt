The brochure promised an "authentic local experience," which I now understand was a clever euphemism for being led in a perfect circle through the same industrial park for forty-five minutes by a guide whose only navigational tool was a profound, unshakable sense of self-belief. His name was Stefan. He kept pointing at a pigeon on a power line, insisting it was a rare mountain eagle and a sign we were on the right path. A retired couple from Ohio, bless their hearts, were actually taking pictures, whispering about the bird’s “majestic profile,” while the rest of us just shuffled along, a silent congregation in a failing cult. You couldn't even be mad; the commitment to the delusion was so complete, so pure, that it transcended mere incompetence and became something closer to experimental theater. I almost wanted to applaud.
