You’re not even listening,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. He didn’t look up from the little silver bird in his hands, its mechanism exposed like a wound. He was trying to fix it, this tiny, intricate thing my grandmother had loved. A soft click, and the bird shot out, its head lolling to one side. Instead of a trill, it emitted a sound like a dying squeak toy, a single, mournful note that hung in the silence between us. He winced, fiddling with a minuscule gear with the tip of a screwdriver. He wanted to fix this one small thing, as if it could somehow mend the rest. With another twist, a spring launched itself from the bird's chest, arcing through the dim light before pinging softly against my water glass. The bird just sat there, its beak agape, utterly and finally broken. A laugh, small and empty, escaped my lips before I could stop it.
