I know how it must have looked to all of you, me walking away from the engagement my family had celebrated on the front page of the *Gazette*, leaving the keys to the shop on the counter where my grandfather had left them for my father. It was my inheritance, my future laid out on a map this whole town had helped draw. But that life, the one everyone had planned for me since I was a child, felt like wearing clothes that were a size too small, constricting me with every breath. When I met him, it wasn't about betraying a promise; it was about finally being able to breathe, to feel a future that was mine instead of a blueprint handed down through generations. You can call it selfish, and maybe it was, but staying would have been a different kind of lie, a quiet betrayal of the only person I’m truly stuck with for the rest of my days: myself. I couldn’t live that lie for you.
