The subway doors hissed open, and another wave of humanity spilled onto the platform, a torrent of faces I would never see again. I pressed myself against the cold, tiled wall, a single, forgotten stone in a rushing river. Each person pushed past, their eyes fixed on some unseen destination, their bodies moved by an invisible current. Did she, the woman with the tired eyes and the violin case, decide to be here at this exact moment? Did the young man arguing into his phone choose this fight, this train, this life? Or were we all just caught in the city's massive, grinding gears, convinced we were steering while being carried relentlessly forward? The roar of the approaching train felt like an answer, a deafening shout that drowned out the tiny whisper of my own will, leaving only the cold certainty of the track ahead and the crushing weight of where it was already going.
