The slick, dark pavement was glistening under the streetlights when a flash of white caught my eye, wedged against the curb. It was a thick manila envelope, already soaked at the corners. A quick glance around—no one. Just a river of hurried umbrellas and downturned faces. Inside my coat, I used my thumb to pry open the damp flap. My breath hitched. It was full of hundred-dollar bills, neatly banded. My first instinct was to scan the crowd, to look for a frantic, searching face, for anyone who looked like they’d just lost their entire world. But my feet felt rooted to the spot. A knot of pure, sickening opportunity tightened in my stomach as I thought of my landlord’s face, the overdue notices, the constant weight. It would be so easy. A fresh start, right here in my hand, offered up by the anonymous city. No one would ever know. I slipped the envelope into the inner pocket of my bag, zipped it shut, and quickened my pace to blend back into the crowd.
