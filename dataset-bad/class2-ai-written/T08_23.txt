The siren wail fades into the general hum of the street, just another layer of noise. I'm watching two men on the corner, one with a dark coffee stain blooming across his expensive-looking shirt. The guy who spilled it is trying to apologize, holding out a crumpled twenty, but the stained man just keeps shaking his head, his voice getting louder. It stopped being about the coffee a minute ago. Now it's about humiliation, about one man wanting to make the other feel the same sting of public embarrassment he feels. I get it, in a way; you want things to be made whole again. But there’s a line, isn't there? A point where balancing the scales tips over into simply wanting payback, and it feels like we’re right on that edge. Out here, with a million people rushing past, who is the referee? Everyone just seems to be carrying their own personal rulebook, deciding for themselves what's fair.
