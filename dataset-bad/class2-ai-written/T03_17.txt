Leo finally stopped crying about an hour ago. He just sits there now, staring at the chipped Formica tabletop like it holds all the answers to how he managed to wreck Dad’s truck and get tangled up with that crowd from the next county over. When Sheriff Brody knocks on our door in the morning, and he will, I’m the one who will answer. I’ll tell him I was the one driving, that I made a stupid mistake. It’s the only way. In a place this small, a story like that will stick to Leo forever, clinging to him long after he’s supposed to be heading off to college. People around here already think I’m a bit of a lost cause, so one more bad decision on my record won’t really change much. They can whisper about me at the post office all they want; it’s a small price to pay to make sure my brother’s name stays clean, to give him the future our family name is supposed to guarantee.
