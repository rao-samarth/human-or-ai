The cicadas have started their evening hum, a sound that’s louder than the talk down at the general store but somehow less piercing. I had to let Miller go last week. People see it as a betrayal after fifteen years, a cold calculation from a man they thought they knew. They don’t see the letters from the bank or understand that it was either his job or the whole operation, taking three other paychecks down with it. I could have probably scraped by for another season, borrowed against the house again, but that felt like promising something I couldn't deliver, and that’s a different kind of debt. So I made the call, and now I sit with the quiet fields and the knowledge that I kept the farm afloat, even if my own name feels like it’s sunk to the bottom of the creek.
