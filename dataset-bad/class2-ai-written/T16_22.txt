The path was just a faint line through the tall grass, and I was so lost in the drone of the afternoon insects that I almost didn't see it. The bull was maybe fifty yards away, its massive head low, watching me. All the blood in my body went cold. Every instinct screamed at me to turn and sprint back the way I came, to vault the rickety fence and just be gone. But I remembered some half-forgotten advice about not running. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely unbutton my coat. I fumbled it off, holding it open to make myself seem bigger, a ridiculous scarecrow against the wide, empty sky. My own breathing sounded impossibly loud in the stillness. I took a slow, deliberate step to the side, away from its direct line, my eyes never leaving its. The fear was a physical thing, a solid weight in my chest, but all I could do was keep moving. Slowly. Calmly.
