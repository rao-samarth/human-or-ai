We had all gathered with a shared, unspoken agreement to uphold a certain decorum for my grandparents' anniversary. Grandfather cleared his throat, ready to deliver a speech he’d practiced for weeks. That was the precise moment Buster, the golden retriever, chose to gently lift the ceremonial glass containing Grandfather's dentures from the side table and trot away. A silent, slow-motion panic rippled through the room as my cousin tried to intercept, only to be tackled at the knees by his own toddler who sensed a new game. This domino effect culminated in Aunt Marie tripping over a previously dormant robotic vacuum, sending a platter of canapés arcing through the air like savory confetti. For a split second, there was only the sound of shattering porcelain and a muffled, toothless protest from the patriarch. Then, a single, unstoppable snort of laughter broke the spell. It was the beautiful, liberating sound of surrender to the universe’s utter indifference to our scripts, a moment where our desperate grasp for control slipped, revealing the far more entertaining reality that we were just characters in a play we couldn't possibly direct.
