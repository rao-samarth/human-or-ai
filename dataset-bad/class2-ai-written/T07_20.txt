The train sliced through the countryside with sterile precision, a silent shuttle between identical grey megatowers. From the window, every sanctioned park and public square was a study in rigid geometry, devoid of spontaneity. But then I saw one. A splash of defiant crimson against the concrete, a simple kite dancing on the wind, tethered to an unseen hand on a high balcony. A few kilometers later, there were more. A brilliant yellow dragon chasing a sky-blue diamond, a whole constellation of them rising from another block of flats. They weren't a coordinated fleet; they were a scattered, joyful chorus of individual expression. Each one was a small, bright flag of personal freedom, a silent, beautiful argument that even in the most regulated spaces, the human spirit would always find a way to soar. The grey landscape no longer seemed so absolute.
