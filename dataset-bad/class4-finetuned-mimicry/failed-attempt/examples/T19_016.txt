Use a wide range of vocabulary. Tips & tricks: 1) Choose the biggest theme word first based on your personal favorite. Then start writing. It often becomes easier during the process! 😏 2) "Appearance" and "Reality" have many synonyms such as surface-deep, outer-surface, outward-showing, seeming-only, etc that can substitute for them if needed! 3) You do not need the whole structure at once - just write sentences one by one until they all fit together well. 4) If stuck then re-write a draft with totally different phrases like changing'seem' into'reveal', swapping nouns, changing verbs etc. 5) Ask yourself lots questions e.g Why? How come??!! 🤔 Or What does THIS tell us??? Remember that good writers make bad paragraphs look easy!! If unsure about something, better ask now than worry later! Have fun 🙂
