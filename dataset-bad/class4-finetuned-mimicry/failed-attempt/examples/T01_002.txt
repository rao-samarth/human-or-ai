Avoid stodginess and rigidity like "The man's name was John Hatteras" [example - very boring] or an empty repetition of words/concepts/sentences ["He has black hair", "His hair is black"] instead make sentences varied and interesting. - Some other examples which are BAD because they're too short: "I smiled at him." or "At one point he glanced back at me". Too many of these would ruin the piece! - There should ideally always by MORE than two characters on stage at once. - In your case: protagonist and narrator - ALWAYS!
