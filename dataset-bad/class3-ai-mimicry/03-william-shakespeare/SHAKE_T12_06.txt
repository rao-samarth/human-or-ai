This dusty road doth stretch on without end, and my soul grows weary with the journey’s toil. Yet see, upon that distant hill, how the sun doth catch the roofs of that rich town, making it seem a haven wrought of purest gold. A siren’s call it is, that whispers to the spirit of soft beds and overflowing coffers, promising an end to all this weary travel; for what is honour when a man’s belly is empty, or virtue when his purse is light? The heart is a poor counsellor when tempted by such shining promises, and the will a brittle shield against their constant siege. A man may think he seeks but simple comfort from his labours, yet soon he finds he hath sold his very substance for a glittering shadow, and walks a far more wretched and impoverished road than this.
