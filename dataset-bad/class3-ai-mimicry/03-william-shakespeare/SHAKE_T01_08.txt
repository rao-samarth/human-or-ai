Pray, tell me, good sir, doth the air taste sweeter from such a lofty height, or is it merely thinner? You wear your new-won honours as a peacock wears its plumes, a brave and glittering show, yet I see the hollow man beneath. A fair exchange, I grant you: a coronet of gold for a conscience clad in thorns. You have traded honest counsel for the thin, cold smiles of sycophants, and for what? A name to be whisper'd in halls where your true nature is the foulest jest of all. Each stone of this grand edifice you have raised is mortared with a friend's betrayal; 'tis a marvel the walls do not weep with sorrow. But no matter. Enjoy the fruits of your great labour, for they must be sweet indeed to mask the bitter taste of all that you have lost to gain them.
