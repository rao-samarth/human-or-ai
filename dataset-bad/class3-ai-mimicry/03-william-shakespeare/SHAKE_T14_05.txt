Observe you the blacksmith's boy, how he doth puff his chest and boast of the life he means to forge for himself, as if the very stars must bend to his mighty will. He speaks of journeys to far-off shires and fortunes won by his own cunning hand, all the while his palms grow calloused gripping the selfsame hammer his father held. What a merry jest! The path from his cradle to his anvil was trod by a hundred ghosts of his own blood, and he, poor fool, deems each footstep a discovery. We are all such players in this provincial farce, prattling of our grand intentions whilst the grooves of custom and consequence guide our feet to the inevitable grave, and we applaud our own navigation down a river whose course was set ere the world began.
