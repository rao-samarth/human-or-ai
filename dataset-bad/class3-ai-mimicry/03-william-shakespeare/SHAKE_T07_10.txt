Dost thou still set thy jaw against my will, and in mine own hall make thy face a mask of insolence? Think you my command is but a fleeting vapour, to be dispersed by a maiden’s pouting sigh? I tell thee, girl, this bond is sworn and sealed; my word is iron, and it shall not bend for all thy tears. You are my ward, my charge, and what I purpose for your good, you shall accept as good, or learn the cost of such ungrateful spirit. To defy me is to court a desolation darker than this midnight, for my patience, which hath been a generous king, is now become a tyrant near to wrath. Speak not another word of thy heart’s preference, for thy heart is but a foolish, fluttering thing which I, in wisdom, must make fast and keep secure from its own wild affections.
