I run! The briars catch my cloak and tear at me like angry claws, yet I feel them not, for a sharper torment doth rend my very soul. This tranquil field, this placid sky—they are but liars, a painted scene to mock the hellish riot that consumes my mind. Whence comes this ceaseless drumming in mine ears? 'Tis not the thumping of my feet upon the earth, but the frantic beat of a black and perjured heart. I throw myself against a silent oak, its rough bark a poor penance for the smoothness of my treachery. Oh, to silence the voice that whispers my foul deed with every rustle of the leaves, to break the glass within my mind that shows my face, not as it is, but as a villain's mask, twisted by deceit! I cannot rest; I cannot stay. I must go on, though to what end or what relief, I know not.
