You bid me speak plain, my lord, and give cause for this black humour that sits upon my brow. I did but watch him, this new-made favourite, as he took the Duke’s own cup, his face alight with a grace he never earned. And in that moment, a most vile and bitter poison did seem to course within my veins, a choler born not of a single slight but of a thousand unseen injuries. Wherefore should his fortune bloom so brightly, whilst my own service, loyal and unceasing, withers on the vine? I see him bow, and think it mockery; I hear the laughter of the court, and it sounds a knell to my own name. He is a glass wherein I see my own prospects shattered into dust, and every plaudit given him is but a stone cast at my own worth. His very presence is a worm that gnaws upon my peace, a constant whisper that all I am, and all I have ever striven for, is held as naught.
