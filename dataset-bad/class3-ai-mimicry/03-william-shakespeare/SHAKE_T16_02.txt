Upon this gentle rise, where all the world was green and still, a sudden chill did creep into the air, and a tremor, born not of the earth but of the spirit, took hold of my limbs. Forsooth, mine own heart, that traitorous drum, did beat a coward’s rhythm, and my thoughts, like scattered sheep, sought shelter from some wolf unseen. But then, as the first pale light of morning didst pierce the greyest cloud, so too a new resolve broke upon my soul. This quaking is but vapour; a mist that the firm sun of a settled mind can burn away. Let what may come; I shall not be a willow that the wind doth bend to weeping, but stand as the great oak that greets the coming storm, and finds in its own strength the promise of a truer, brighter day.
