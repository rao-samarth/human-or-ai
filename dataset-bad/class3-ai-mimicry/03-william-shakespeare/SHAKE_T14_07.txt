By this guttering candle's light, my friend, a most unnerving fancy doth possess my waking mind. We play our parts upon this common earth, believing we move the pieces as our own wit commands, much like a cunning gamester at his board. We celebrate a victory as the fruit of our sharp device, and mourn a loss as the fault of a moment’s folly. Yet what if the dice, whose clatter gives our stratagems their shape, were thrown by some unseen hand long ere the game began? What if we but act the motions, whilst the sum of all our striving was determined in that first, unalterable cast? In this dim chamber, I begin to wonder if our proudest choices are but the echoes of a judgment made elsewhere, and our will a mere and paltry shadow to the substance of what must be.
