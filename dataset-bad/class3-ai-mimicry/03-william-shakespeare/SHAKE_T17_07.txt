Why dost thou stand there, gaping like a fish cast upon the shore, when our very lives hang upon the swiftness of our heels? I charged thee with a simple office, a single deed to smooth our parting from this wretched town; I said, make ready the swift grey mare in the covert! Yet, from yonder chamber, I hear a most un-horse-like sound, a muffled grunting, as of a hog trapped in a nobleman’s breeches. Speak, man, ere I am moved to strike thee! What manner of creature hast thou stowed away that groans with such a human fury? By heaven, if thou tell'st me thou hast again mistaken my plain English for some tangled riddle, and have instead procured the town crier to announce our flight with a trumpet, I shall leave thee here to face the music of the gallows alone.
