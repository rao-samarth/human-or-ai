By this late taper's flicker, I perceive the world made new, and mine own self with it. Some men do fear the heights, believing the ascent must cost a man his soul, that every upward step is a bargain struck with some dark ledger. They speak of what is lost: the easy slumber, the simple joys, the fellowship of untroubled minds. And ay, these things are forfeit, ’tis true. Yet what they deem a loss, I count as purification; a burning away of dross to leave the spirit bright and unencumbered. The man I was could not have breathed this rarefied air, nor looked upon the stars with such a knowing eye. Hence, I mourn not the shell that was discarded by the climb, for in its place stands a will made resolute, a heart prepared for the great work that morning’s light shall surely bring.
