Hark, what sudden vision parts this witless, shoving throng? By heaven, 'tis her form! Yonder she doth turn the corner, quick as a startled doe, and my heart, that traitorous drum, leaps against my ribs to give chase. Yet this weighty satchel, bearing a charge I swore to deliver ere the evening bell, doth pull me down to earth and to my purpose. The crowd presses on, a foul-breathed current toward the harbour, toward the ship that I must board, whilst my every sense cries out to break free, to run against the tide and seize that fleeting glimpse of grace. Shall I forsake my given word, my solemn bond made unto a dying man, for a chance, a mere ghost of a hope that she might look on me with favour? The alley shrinks; the moment dies. I am undone by this crossroads, where my feet must obey my honour, though my soul would fly another way.
