Cease this sermon, sir, for the very timbers of this house groan to hear such piety preached by such a sinner. You rail against the flesh as if you were made of naught but spirit, yet your breath still stinks of another’s wine and your collar is marked with a colour your wife does not wear. Prithee, what holy book taught you that a man’s soul is cleansed by loudly condemning in others the very rot that festers in his own heart? A marvelous player you are, to mount the public pulpit with a face of gravest stone, whilst in private you perform such comedies of vice as would make a jester blush. You are a hollow reed, making a saintly music with borrowed air, but a fool’s noise when squeezed by truth. Go now, lecture the moon on its spots; mayhap it will find your counsel more sincere than I.
