In this great hall, where wine doth loosen tongues to flattery, mark you how yon lord presents his chronicle of deeds. He trims the ragged edge of failure from his memory, and with a cunning art doth stitch a hero’s mantle from the common cloth of chance. He offers up this polished stone, bereft of all its natural flaws, and prays his sovereign will mistake it for a gem of purest worth. Yet look upon our Prince’s face! A knowing light plays in his eye, a subtle mirth that sees the bauble for its value and the man for his ambition. For such shadows cannot long abide where reason’s lamp is lit; they shrink and flee before its steady flame, and what is solid, plain, and honest is at last revealed to all, made brighter by the very darkness it hath overcome.
