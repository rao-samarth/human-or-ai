Hark, how my kinsmen laugh and make good cheer, and I, their host, do pour the ruddy wine as if my own heart were not a shrivelled thing. They see a smiling face, and praise my bounty; a fine performance, is it not? Yet in mine ear, a different music plays—a ceaseless, dull lament for what is broken, for a trust undone by my own hand. Wherefore doth this fine-spun fellowship feel but a spider’s web, in which I, the wretched spinner, am now most truly caught? Each joyful cry doth strike my soul like a hammer’s blow, and every kind look they cast my way is but a hot coal set upon the raw and open wound within. Perchance they see nought but a gracious host, yet I am a king reigning o’er a secret kingdom of regret, a ghost that haunts its own feast, condemned to smile whilst the worm of my own making doth feed upon me from within.
