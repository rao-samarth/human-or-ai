Hark, what clamour breaks the midnight peace? The great bell tolls a frantic, fearful peal, as if the very heavens were set ablaze, and from every door the good folk spill in states of strange undress. The baker, powdered not with flour but fright, clutches a pail of water meant for dough; the town’s chief magistrate, his pate quite bare, has forgot his wig of office on its stand. I alone, charged with the town's good keep, do know the cause of this most dreadful sound. It is not fire, nor foe, nor fearsome plague. Nay, 'tis but old Thomas, the sexton, who, having made too deep acquaintance with the ale-house cask, now pulls the rope as if to ring in judgement day itself. And what report am I to give these souls? Shall I declare the simple, drunken truth, and make our sexton and our panic laughing-stocks for every passing merchant, or shall I invent some phantom cat stuck in a chimney-pot, and so restore good order with a fib? A constable's lot is a vexing thing, caught thus betwixt a fool's folly and a town's pride.
