Observe yon brook, how in the sun's embrace it doth make a pretty show, its surface a thousand glittering shards of light. The music it doth play upon the smooth-worn stones is a lullaby for a weary mind, promising gentle passage and a cool balm for the heated brow. Yet this sweet seeming is but a cunning mask; for beneath that smiling face, the current moves with a serpent's secret strength, and the dark weeds below cling like a jealous lover's hand. Many a stout wading staff hath been splintered by the unseen rocks that lie in its heart, and its soft murmur is but a pleasing lie to cloak the cold and silent truth of its devouring depths. So are the fairest surfaces of this world oft but a gilded cover upon a hollow tomb, and what sings most sweetly to the ear may prove the foulest poison to the soul.
