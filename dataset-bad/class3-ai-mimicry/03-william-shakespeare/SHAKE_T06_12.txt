Mark you how young Master Finch doth preen and strut, for the guildsman hath but praised his hurried script. He fashions a quick smile, a ready bow, a jest that costs him naught, and for these trifles he is called a prodigy, a right-hand man in the making. And I? I labour till my fingers ache and mine eyes grow dim with the candlelight, my ledgers true and my accounts most perfect, yet scarce a nod is thrown my way. It is a worm that gnaws within my gut, a bitter choler that rises in my throat when I behold his easy, unearned triumphs. His very breath seems sweeter to our master than my years of loyal, silent service. Wherefore should fortune so favour the shallow stream whilst the deep well is utterly ignored and left to go to seed?
