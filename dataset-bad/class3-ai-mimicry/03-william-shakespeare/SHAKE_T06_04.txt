Forsooth, I cannot but mark how my own wife’s countenance doth brighten when her cousin speaks, as if his every word were some rare and polished gem. He sits there, preening in his fine new doublet, and she laughs, a sound I have not drawn from her these many weeks. A most unwelcome humour stirs within my breast, for what merit hath this man, what wit or substance, that he should so easily steal the light that by all rights is mine? I watch them from across this crowded hall, and a vile suspicion takes hold, a gnawing worm that asks whence came his sudden fortune and why her eyes do follow him so. Methinks I am made a stranger at my own feast, a paltry shadow whilst this gaudy popinjay doth play the sun, and I fear what mischief grows in hearts too long given to such idle company.
