Behold young Barnaby, whose sworn fealty to poor Gilbert was but an hour ago the talk of all assembled. Now see him stand, his gaze fixed not upon his comrade’s trusting face, but upon the last roasted quail, which our host, with cruel sport, hath offered up as a prize. For what price? A mere jest, he calls it, a trifling tale to expose some folly of his friend, to make the ladies titter and the old men choke upon their wine. The poor knave’s countenance is a battlefield writ plain; his stomach doth make a valiant charge against his heart, and I’ll wager all my silver that the bird, a paltry thing of bone and grease, shall prove the stronger general. Prithee, watch how a bond of ten years’ making may be undone by a well-cooked fowl and the promise of a lord’s fleeting favour.
