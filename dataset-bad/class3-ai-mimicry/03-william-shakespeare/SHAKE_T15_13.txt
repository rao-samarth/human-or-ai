Let them sleep, for they know not what truth the moon reveals! Here, in this quiet chamber, I have unwound the very threads of heaven’s design, and they are fashioned not of chance, but of a perfect, ringing harmony. Three nights I have forsworn my bed, my mind a field where these new stars do battle with the old, and I have found the victors. Why, this simple sequence of numbers, this elegant arc I have inscribed, holds a power to calm the restless sea and bid the crops to grow! My wife doth think me lost to some strange malady, and begs me to find my rest, but she cannot see the glorious order that now shines so clear to me. This is no sickness; ‘tis a blessed clarity, a key to unlock the world’s own soul, and soon all men shall thank this sleepless vigil that has brought such light into their days.
