Hark, the bell-ringer climbs his lonely spire, a duty plain to every soul in this parish save mine own. For I alone discern the message in his ringing; 'tis not a call to prayer, but a knell for my sanity, a brazen clangour that proclaims my secret shame across the cobblestones. With every pull of the rope, he weaves a new torment. Mark how the noon bell lingers, a hollow tone that mocks my empty coffers, and see how the evening peal doth hasten, as if to speed my miserable end! The common folk cross themselves and think of heaven; I grip the walls and think on him, this puppet-master in his high stone cage, who plays upon the air itself a symphony of my undoing. What devil gave this man a rope and tongue of bronze to plague my every waking thought?
