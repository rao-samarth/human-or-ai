Dame Alice unfolds the letter with a practiced sigh, its crinkled edges speaking of some far-off sorrow she alone must bear. Her children lean close, their faces upturned like hungry fledglings. She reads aloud her absent son's words, yet her tongue proves a most cunning editor; she omits his fond regards for his sister, and turns a jest about his brother’s thrift into a pointed barb. A simple line of homesick longing she doth render as a judgment upon all who remain behind. See how she pauses, letting the silence twist the half-told tale into a sharper weapon? She gives them just enough of the letter’s form to swear it true, but starves them of its heart, leaving them to feast upon the poisoned scraps of envy and suspicion she so carefully provides. Thus, a missive of love becomes an instrument of discord, and she, its sole interpreter, sits contented in the ruin she has wrought.
