Look you now upon that prosperous man, whose lands do swell as if with some proud sickness. He hath swallowed every humble acre 'round, and for this grand consumption, his lessers bow and scrape, mistaking avarice for wit. A most cunning prince of pastures he is, to be sure; he commands the very rain, it seems, and forces from the weary ground a crop that dazzles a fool’s eye. Yet mark how the soil grows pale beneath his plough, how the good birds have fled his silent fields where naught but profit is sown. He boasts of a full coffer, but sups alone with the ghost of his own charity, a feast of splendid desolation. Pray, let him hoard his gilded grain; a man may die of thirst whilst sitting on a chest of gold, and his sour earth shall be his only monument.
