Prithee, speak no more, for thy tongue is a false player upon a rotten stage, and I am weary of the play. Didst thou truly think this common hamlet, these simple folk, would ne'er look past the painted kindness fixed upon thy face? We took thee for a man of honour, a neighbour of good report, yet all the while thy heart was a foreign country, full of plots and treacherous maps unknown to us. To sup at our tables, to pray in our pews, to offer comfort with a hand that secretly holds a dagger—what manner of fiend art thou? Thy whole life amongst us hath been a lie, a counterfeit coin passed from hand to honest hand, and now its base metal shows through, ugly and dull. The masquerade is at an end, sir, and the visage beneath is a more fearsome spectacle than any devil's mask worn on All Hallows' Eve.
