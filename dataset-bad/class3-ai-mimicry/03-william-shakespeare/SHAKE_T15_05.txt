We passed a carriage on the King's road but for a moment, yet in that briefest space, I saw a face that hath unmade me quite. A face! What foolishness is this? I know not her name, nor her station, nor whither she was bound, yet her image is burned upon my inner sight as with a brand. My own journey is now a pointless thing, for every path that leads not back to that fleeting encounter feels a road to certain ruin. My fellows grow weary of my ceaseless questions: 'Saw you which way they turned? What colour was their livery?' They whisper I am touched with a fever, and perchance they speak true, for this malady consumes my reason, leaving naught but a hollow, desperate wanting. I must find her, or be undone.
