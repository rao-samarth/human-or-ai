Alas, what bitter fruit from so slight a seed is grown. We stand now in this meadow, he by the stooping willow and I by the stone wall, and the quiet space between us is a wound that will not close. For he did but turn his gaze to mark a linnet’s flight, a fleeting fancy, at the very instant my soul’s most grievous trouble found its tongue. In that swift motion I perceived a deliberate scorn, a heart that would not hear me; a judgment passed in silence. My plea, which cost me dear to speak, fell upon the air as naught but a fool’s petition, and its echo died unanswered. And he, poor wretch, knows not his trespass, asking with his bewildered eyes what sudden winter hath so seized my countenance. I cannot name his crime, for it was no crime at all, but a trick of the eye and a faith too quickly lost, and hence this silence must forever be our only conversation.
