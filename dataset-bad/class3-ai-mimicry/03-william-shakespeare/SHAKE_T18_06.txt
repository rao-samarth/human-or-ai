My master, whose gravity could sink a ship of lead, hath this morn taken to a new printing contrivance, and with such great folly as to make angels weep and devils roar. I am bid to stand silent, yet my conscience wages a most terrible war; for should I step forth to aid him in his inky calamity, or is it a greater sin to stifle the mirth that doth so violently shake my frame? He scrubs at the blot upon his ledger with his own sleeve, smearing the King’s accounts into a black and ruinous puddle, whilst his other hand, seeking some purchase, finds only the precarious tower of stacked petitions, which now do flutter down about his head like a flock of witless paper doves. To help is to share in the disgrace, yet to watch this proud man so humbled by a pot of ink and his own clumsy haste—alas, it is a spectacle of such rare and perfect disorder that my soul cries out for more.
