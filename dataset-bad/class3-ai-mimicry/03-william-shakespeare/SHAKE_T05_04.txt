Prithee, question not the winter in mine eye, nor chide me for this sudden, stony silence. Thou think'st my heart grown cold? Nay, 'tis a furnace that doth rage with such a fire for thee it threatens to consume my very frame. But my father, upon his honour, hath sworn a solemn oath, and my name, that wretched, heavy thing, is bound by public vow to seal a peace my spirit cannot consent to. My fealty to my blood commands I play this hollow part, lest I bring calamity upon our house. To choose thee is to forswear all my kin and prove a traitor to my birthright; yet to choose them is to murder my own soul and live a lie whilst thou dost breathe. I am a captive caught betwixt two warring kings, and my own breast the field of their most bloody conflict, where no side may claim a lasting victory.
