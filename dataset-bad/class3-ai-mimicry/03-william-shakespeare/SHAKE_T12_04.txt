What a blessed companion the heavens have granted me for this tedious journey; a man whose every other word doth praise honesty and whose face is a very map of sober virtue. Yet mark him now, as the fat innkeeper, his mind muddled with accounts, returns to him a shilling more than his due. See how my good fellow’s pious gaze doth shift and slide, avoiding the poor man’s eye as a thief shuns the hangman’s noon. His hand, so quick to make a holy sign, now closes upon the coin with a lover’s secret haste, secreting the silver sliver deep within his purse as if it were a sacred relic. Forsooth, a man's soul is a cheap commodity, to be bartered away for such a paltry sum, and his proclaimed righteousness but a painted curtain to hide the grasping worm that gnaws within. He would sell his own mother for a farthing, I think, had he but the certainty none were there to witness the foul transaction.
