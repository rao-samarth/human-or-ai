You bid me, my lord, to shear the bitterest branch from my account? You call it prudence, a simple kindness to the council's ears, that they should not be troubled with a truth so sharp it might prick their tender comforts. But what you name a kindness, I feel a keener blade within my own soul. To speak but half the matter is to plant a seed of poison, is it not? A well-shaped lie needs not be spoken whole; it grows most strong when grafted to a stem of verity, flourishing in shadows where the full light of day is purposefully denied. This small silence you beseech of me, this simple turning from one damning fact, would surely make an innocent man a villain and crown your own ambitions with a stolen garland. Wherefore must I forswear my honest tongue to serve a cause that wears so false a face?
