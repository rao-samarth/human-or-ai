Observe this clamorous street, where a thousand souls do jostle for a patch of earth, yet a strange and silent law doth govern their every motion. See how the throng, like a parted sea, makes way for my lord’s carriage; the merchant bows his head, the beggar shields his face from the spatter of the gilded wheels, and the common drudge shrinks into the wall as if he were but shadow. No word is spoken, no command is given, yet every man knows his place as if it were branded upon his very flesh at birth. For in this world, a man’s worth is measured not by his heart’s quality but by the fineness of his cloth; his station is writ upon him, and by that alone is he judged great or small, a master to be feared or a creature to be trodden underfoot with scarce a thought.
