Why do you sit thus, with faces painted o'er by mirth, and raise your cups to fortunes you imagine true? You see this hall, arrayed in costly cloth and shining with a thousand lamps, and deem it a fine palace of content. But I say it is a whited sepulchre, fair on the outside, yet filled within with rottenness and the bones of broken vows. Your host, who smiles so graciously upon you all, hath a heart as cold and barren as a winter stone; his promises are but the fleeting breath of morning mist, vanished ere the sun is high. This feast is but a play, a cunning pageant meant to blind your eyes to the ruin that creeps, like a slow poison, through the veins of this great house. So drink, I pray you, drink deep of this illusion, for the truth, once swallowed, is a bitter draught indeed.
