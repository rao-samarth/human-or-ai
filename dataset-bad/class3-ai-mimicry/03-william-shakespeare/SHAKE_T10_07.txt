My master sits hunched o'er his great ledger, his quill scratching like a rat in the wainscot. He calls it 'ordering the numbers for a clearer understanding', yet I see how he doth marshal them like soldiers to a false campaign. A hefty sum, once a grievous loss, is by his art transformed into a 'future investment'; a barren quarter's toil is painted as a 'strategic fallow'. He turns to me, his smile as thin as a winter wafer, and speaks of shielding the guild from panic, of sparing weaker hearts the burden of a stark and unadorned fact. But what he calls a shield, I see for what it is: a gilded harness he doth fit upon us all, to steer our labours toward his own concealed advantage, leaving us to pull in darkness whilst he alone doth see the path.
