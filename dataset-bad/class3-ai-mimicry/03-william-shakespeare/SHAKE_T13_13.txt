Forsooth, I did walk into that chamber with a port and countenance fit for a king, bearing my new-wrought enterprise as 'twere a crown upon a cushion. I looked for naught but praise from all my fellows, and from our governor a handsome commendation for the art I had devised. But what a base and petty error did he find; a simple sum, misplaced in a column, a trifle I had scorned to check in my great haste to be admired! And in that moment, all my lofty sails of vanity were rent, and I stood dumb, a common fool before them all. The hot blush that did rise upon my cheek was a most cruel fire, and the silent mirth I spied in every eye served as a louder judgment than any thunder. Thus am I brought low, my good opinion of myself a ruin'd thing, made cheap by my own hand.
