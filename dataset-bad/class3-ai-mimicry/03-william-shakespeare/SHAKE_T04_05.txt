This weary road hath made a stranger of him, or perchance it is the promise lying at its end. Where once his laughter was a ready coin to pay for any hardship, now a grim and studied silence keeps his company. He looks upon the setting sun not with a poet's eye, as was his wont, but with the narrow gaze of a man who calculates his gains. What devil's bargain was whispered in his ear at that last wretched inn? I dare not ask, for his face, which once was an open book to me, hath become a sealed and guarded text. The fealty sworn 'twixt us in brighter days feels now a brittle thing, a glass that might be shattered by the next stone in our path. I fear the gold that awaits us will purchase him a kingdom, but leave me a pauper in spirit, utterly alone.
