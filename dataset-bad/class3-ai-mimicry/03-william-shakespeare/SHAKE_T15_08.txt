There, by the fishmonger's stall, he stands again! Doth heaven mock me with this vision, or doth some devilish art place him forever in my path? The clamour of this square, a thousand voices crying their wares and woes, doth fade into a dull and distant hum whenever his form appears. I know not his name, nor his station, yet I have charted every turn of his head, every shadow that plays upon his cheek, as a mariner charts the pitiless stars. All other faces are but blurs of grease and sweat, a monstrous beast with many heads, but his alone is sharp and clear. I must follow; I must learn what portent he carries for my soul, for to lose his sight now were a greater torment than hell's own fire, a blindness I could not endure.
