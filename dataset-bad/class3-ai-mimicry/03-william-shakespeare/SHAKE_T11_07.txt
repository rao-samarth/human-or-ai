Through brake and thicket I pursued the knave, my lungs afire and vengeance my sole spur! He had my rabbit, the prize of a long day’s snare, and for this theft I’d see him soundly thrashed. At the stream’s edge I caught him, seizing the scoundrel’s coat and raising a fist to mete out rustic justice. But then he turned, and laughed! No starveling beggar this, but the young lord from the great house, his silken tunic torn by a thorn, a jest lighting his eyes. At once the strength fled from my arm, my knuckles turning white with fear, not fury. What power is this, that turns a righteous man into a trespasser by naught but a glimpse of a better-stitched coat? My hand fell slack, my tongue, so lately filled with oaths, stammered some fool’s pardon, for I had laid a farmer’s grip upon a golden neck.
