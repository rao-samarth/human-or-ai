The music seem'd to hush; a hundred eyes, once merry, turn'd to me, their curiosity a heavy cloak upon my shoulders. And in that quiet, I felt two worlds contend within my soul: one built on years of sworn and brother'd faith, the other gilded with a promise that might make a king of me. What answer could I give? To ruin him, or beggar my own future?
