“Make haste, good brother,” called Alaric from the furrow’s end, his voice light with jest, “for thy scythe moves with such a leaden grace, I fear the harvest moon shall find us yet at this same task!” He meant it for a simple goad, a puff of wind to lighten their sun-scorched toil in the silent fields. But his brother, Edmund, whose heart already churned with some unspoken bile, heard in it a venomous sting of mockery. The scythe fell from his grasp with a clang that broke the country peace. “Dost thou play the lord and scorn my sweat?” he roared, his voice a sudden thunder. “Then by all the saints, let us see which man is made of stronger stuff!” And ere Alaric could frame a placating word or swear his innocent intent, Edmund lunged across the mown grass, his fists raised not in jest but in earnest fury. The air, once filled with the sweet scent of hay, was soured in an instant by a brother’s rage, and a bond forged in the womb was undone by a careless, ill-heard word.
