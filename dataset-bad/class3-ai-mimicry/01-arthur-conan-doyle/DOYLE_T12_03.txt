I watched my friend, Finch, and saw in his countenance a most pitiable struggle. The deed lay upon the table between us, its crisp parchment seeming to mock his agitation; a simple instrument, yet it promised a sum which, to a man in his straitened circumstances, must have appeared as the very keys to paradise. His breath came in short, sharp bursts, and his gaze—ordinarily so clear and direct—darted from my face to the damnable paper as a cornered animal eyes its escape. It was, I confess, a terrible thing to witness: a fundamentally decent man wrestling with a phantom of wealth so potent that it threatened to strangle every principle he had ever held dear. For the simple price of a name scrawled in ink, he was offered a life free from care; yet I perceived that the first payment on such a bargain would be the forfeiture of his very soul.
