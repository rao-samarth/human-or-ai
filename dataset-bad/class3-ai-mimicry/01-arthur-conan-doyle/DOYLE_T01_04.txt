I chanced to see old Atherton this afternoon, his hansom caught for a moment in the ceaseless traffic near the Exchange. There could be no mistaking that profile, though it was sharper now, and etched with a weariness that went far deeper than mere fatigue. I recall the man from our university days, a fellow possessed of a singular fire and a rather reckless good humour; he spoke then with a boundless certainty of the heights he would one day scale. Well, he has scaled them, indubitably so, for his name is now spoken with a certain reverence in the City’s most influential circles. Yet, as I watched his carriage lurch forward and disappear into the gloom, I could not help but reflect upon the curious and lamentable bargain he had struck. The keenness in his eye was gone, replaced by the vacant stare of a man who, having conquered his world, has found it to be a remarkably empty and desolate kingdom.
