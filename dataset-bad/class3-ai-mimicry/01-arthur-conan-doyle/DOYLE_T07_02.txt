You ask me, sir, why I took such a measure, and I shall answer you plainly. For five years I have observed the machinations of Mr Abernathy, whose every directive served only to tighten the screw upon the men who laboured beneath him; his authority had become so absolute, his pronouncements so final, that we were reduced to mere cogs in a mechanism of his own design. We were not colleagues, but instruments. To resist openly would have been folly, a dismissal forthwith. Therefore, my own small protest was a thing of ink and paper—a single, seemingly trifling alteration to the quarterly ledger which, though minute, would sow just enough confusion to prove that the machine was not infallible. It was no grand act of sedition, you understand, but rather a quiet insistence that even the humblest clerk must be permitted a mind of his own, lest he become nothing more than the pen he wields.
