You have laid your facts before me with the dexterous hand of a card-sharp, sir, and I grant you, each is impeccable in its isolation. The timestamp on the letter; the witness who saw the cab depart; the muddied boot-print upon the stair—all are undeniably true. But truth, when curated with such cunning, becomes the most potent of falsehoods. You have built a fortress of veracious trifles, and you imagine yourself quite safe within its walls, yet you have omitted the keystone upon which the entire structure depends. You do not speak of the second telegram, do you? The one which arrived not an hour after the first. You withhold it, you discount it, you pray it is forgotten, for that single slip of paper transforms your entire narrative from a tragedy of circumstance into a most deliberate and wicked contrivance. It is not what you have said that condemns you, man; it is the deafening silence of what you have not.
