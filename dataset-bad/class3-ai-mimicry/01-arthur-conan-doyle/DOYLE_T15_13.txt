You ask, my dear fellow, how I find our mutual acquaintance, Professor Albright. I wish I could furnish you with some reassuring news, but his state, I fear, has grown most singular. His entire intellect—a mind once dedicated to the logical certainties of botany—is now consumed by a phantom percussion he claims to hear from the study’s wainscoting. Last night, I found him upon his knees, ear pressed to the cold oak, a geologist’s hammer in his hand. He spoke in a fevered whisper of a “rhythmic imperfection” and has since prised away three panels, convinced some infernal mechanism ticks just beyond his reach. He will entertain no rational explanation—not the house settling, nor the wind in the eaves—and I confess a profound unease has settled upon me, for the only ticking I can discern is that which seems to emanate from the unstable workings of his own overwrought mind.
