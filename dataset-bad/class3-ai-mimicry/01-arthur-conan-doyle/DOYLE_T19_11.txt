The old parsonage presented a most singular study in bucolic tranquillity; to the casual passer-by, it was the very picture of serene country life, with its neatly trimmed hedgerows and the gentle plume of smoke ascending from its chimney. Yet I, who have made it my business to look beyond the mere veneer of things, could not shake the impression of a profound and carefully maintained artifice. The roses, for instance, were too perfect, their arrangement upon the trellis a matter of such geometric precision as to suggest not a love of horticulture, but rather a desperate, almost frantic, imposition of order. One might even fancy that the very silence which enveloped the place was not the peace of contentment, but the strained quiet of a household holding its breath. I have come to believe that behind that stout oak door, amidst the scent of polish and potpourri, there plays out a daily drama of such exquisite misery that its containment requires this constant, frantic polishing of its cage.
