The annual village fete, an affair intended to be a model of pastoral decorum, had instead descended into a spectacle of the most singular disarray. It began, it seems, when the mayor’s prized bulldog, a creature of formidable will and negligible intellect, took a sudden and violent dislike to the floral arrangement on the bake-off judge’s hat. This single act of canine rebellion precipitated a cascade of minor catastrophes: the judge, in her panicked retreat, overturned a trestle table laden with award-winning jams, whose sticky contents sent the local constable skidding into the tent housing the poultry competition. What followed was a maelstrom of feathers, frantic squawking, and shattered preserves. To the detached observer, the sight of a dignitary attempting to placate a furious goose with a half-eaten scone, whilst the town’s chief lawman lay submerged in marmalade, was a study in sequential failure so complete that it achieved a kind of chaotic perfection.
