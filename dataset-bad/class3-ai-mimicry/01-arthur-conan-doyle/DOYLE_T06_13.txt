From my corner of the railway carriage, I observed the young man opposite as he spoke with his companion, her countenance alight with an admiration I had not myself inspired in many a year. It is a singular malady of the spirit, this gnawing affliction that takes root in the sight of another’s good fortune. Every smile they exchanged, every shared glance, seemed a calculated affront to my own solitary state and more modest prospects. I found myself dissecting his mannerisms, the cut of his coat, the easy confidence in his voice, searching for some defect—some trivial flaw upon which I might fix my discontent. Yet there was none to be found; and this very perfection only deepened the shadow within me, a cold and creeping suspicion that the world had reserved its finest treasures for others, leaving me to ponder the reasons for my own meagre portion as the bleak countryside rolled past the window.
