Mr. Abernathy leaned forward, his face illuminated by the single gas lamp, and the shadow he cast upon the wall behind him seemed a monstrous and distorted version of the man himself. "Consider it, Finch," he urged, his voice a low, conspiratorial murmur that seemed to fill the small parlour. "A single signature, a moment of convenient oversight, and we shall be free from the drudgery that has yoked us these twenty years." Finch felt a coldness creep into his heart, a sensation quite at odds with the brandy warming his stomach; he knew the proposal for the scoundrel's work it was, a gross betrayal of the trust placed in them. Yet, as Abernathy continued, painting in vivid strokes a future of ease and luxury—of sunlit villas and deference from those who now looked down upon them—the initial chill of conscience began to recede. It was replaced by a dangerous, thrilling heat, a sudden and blinding vision of what such wealth could procure, and the pillar of his own integrity, which had seemed so solid a moment before, began to feel like so much sand.
