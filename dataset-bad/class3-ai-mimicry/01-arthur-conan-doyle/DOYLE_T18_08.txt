It was within the clamorous confines of the Central Parcels Office that I witnessed a most singular concatenation of human error, which for a moment threatened the very foundations of civic order. A clerk, a flustered young man whose spectacles seemed perpetually at odds with the bridge of his nose, had evidently mislaid a vital ledger-book. This single act of negligence, trivial in itself, precipitated a veritable cascade of confusion. Patrons, already vexed by the queue, began to offer their own contradictory solutions with a rising clamour; one stout gentleman insisted the book had been purloined, whilst a lady of nervous disposition began to weep for her lost parcels. The postmaster, a portly fellow with an air of immense but unfounded self-importance, emerged to quell the disturbance, yet his booming pronouncements only succeeded in sending a precariously balanced pyramid of packages tumbling to the floor. The entire affair, which ought to have been a simple matter of administrative lapse, had transformed itself into a magnificent, if unintentional, piece of public theatre—a study in how readily the machinery of progress may be derailed by the smallest of inadequate cogs.
