We found Mr. Albright perched upon a crate in the market square, his face a florid mask of indignation as he lectured the assembled townsfolk. “It is a moral contagion!” he boomed, striking a fist into his palm with a sound like a muffled pistol-shot. “This modern obsession with wasteful leisure and trifling pursuits saps the very marrow from our bones, leaving only a hollow shell where industry and principle ought to reside!” My companion, a man for whom such public displays held a peculiar fascination, nudged me gently in the ribs. “A most stirring oration,” he murmured, his eyes twinkling with a light I knew all too well. “One might almost forget that this is the same gentleman who, only yesterday, commissioned a miniaturist from London to paint a full-length portrait of his prize-winning ferret, complete with a tiny velvet waistcoat.” The good Mr. Albright, quite deaf to this remark, continued his tirade against the follies of others with undiminished vigour.
