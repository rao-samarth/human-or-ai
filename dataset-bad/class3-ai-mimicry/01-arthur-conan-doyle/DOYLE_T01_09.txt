From my quiet recess in the smoking-room, the low murmur of two members near the hearth caught my ear; they spoke of Sir Alistair Finch and his astonishing acquisition of the shipping lines. One cannot but admire the sheer force of will that has propelled the man from obscurity to such a formidable pinnacle of industry in so few years. And yet, what of the man himself? One hears of a nature curiously barren; a hearth without warmth, a life divested of every loyalty and affection which could not be directly capitalised upon. It is the singular, tragic logic of such enterprises: the very qualities which ensure the construction of so great a fortune—the ruthless focus, the excision of all sentiment, the unswerving eye for advantage—are precisely those which guarantee the desolation of the architect's own soul. He has built a colossal edifice of commerce, to be sure, but it strikes me that he has built it with the very stones that should have formed his own character, leaving the structure of his success to serve as both his monument and his tomb.
