Our slow progress along the deeply-rutted lane afforded me a most excellent view of the surrounding countryside, which presented a picture of such pastoral serenity as one seldom encounters in these agitated times. I remarked to my companion that here, surely, was a land untouched by the vices of the city; its inhabitants, one might surmise from the neat-kept gardens and the sturdy, honest aspect of the farmhouses, must be a simple and virtuous folk. He, however, pointed to a distant scarecrow, a thing of peculiar and almost human posture, and muttered something about the folly of judging a book by its cover. A mere trifle, of course, and I told him as much. For it is an elementary principle that the general character of a place is writ large upon its face for any man with eyes to see, and this land was manifestly one of peace. The grotesque figure in the field was of little consequence to the broader, undeniable truth.
