Lord Ashworth inclined his head, a perfect study in diplomatic grace amidst the shimmering throng of the Ambassador’s reception. "I find your line of inquiry to be in the poorest taste, sir," he stated, his voice a silken admonishment. "Utterly baseless." My companion, however, remained quite unmoved by the rebuff, his gaze fixed not upon the nobleman's eyes but upon his hand. "You present a most immaculate front," he murmured, his voice low but carrying with a peculiar intensity. "The polished shoes, the perfectly-knotted cravat; a very paragon of your station. Yet you have overlooked a most trifling detail: that faint, silvery pucker of skin upon the knuckle of your right forefinger. It is not the callus of a sportsman, my lord, nor the ink-stain of a minister. It is, I am quite positive, the minute but permanent signature of a chemical burn—an accident more common to a clandestine laboratory than to a gentleman’s study." For one fleeting instant, the urbane mask shattered, and I saw in Ashworth's eyes a flash of something primitive and quite murderous.
