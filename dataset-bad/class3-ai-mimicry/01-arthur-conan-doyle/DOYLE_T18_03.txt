From my study window, I observed a peculiar tableau unfold upon the village green, one of those small, inglorious dramas which seem to spring from the very soil of our rural life. Mr. Abernathy, the vicar, whose prize-winning vegetables were the source of his only earthly pride, stood wringing his hands as a small, obstinate pony systematically devoured his finest marrow. Our local constable, a man whose physical dimensions were ill-suited to any form of pursuit, had elected to employ a strategy of stern negotiation; he addressed the beast with the solemnity of a magistrate sentencing a felon, a performance which the pony met with an indifferent flick of its tail. A boy was then dispatched for a rope, but returned with a length of twine wholly inadequate for the purpose, which he tripped upon, scattering a basket of eggs intended for the market. I confess I did not laugh, for there was a profound sort of weariness in the sight—a futile, circular pantomime of earnest effort undone by simple chance and the placid certainty of a dumb animal. It was the world in miniature, and I found myself merely sighing before turning back to my books.
