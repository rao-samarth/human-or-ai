Observe, if you will, the small drama which unfolds before us at this carriage door. The portly gentleman, whose coat speaks of a Bond Street tailor, has dropped his newspaper; see how the porter, without a moment’s hesitation, has retrieved it, offering it up with a deferential stoop. The gentleman gives a curt nod—less a gesture of thanks than a simple acknowledgement of a service rightly performed. Here is no common discourtesy, you must understand, but rather the silent workings of a well-oiled machine. Each man understands his part perfectly; the one to serve and the other to be served, an unspoken compact as rigid and as binding as any written law. It is in these trifling, everyday transactions, where not a single word need be exchanged, that the true architecture of our world is most plainly revealed.
