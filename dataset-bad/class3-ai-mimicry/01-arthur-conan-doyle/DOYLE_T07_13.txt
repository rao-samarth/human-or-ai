It was a most singular spectacle, here in the humid air of the great conservatory, to observe a gentleman of considerable substance engaged in a pitched battle with a common Cabbage White. He was, it appeared, the self-appointed guardian of a rather exotic orchid, and the butterfly’s persistent attempts to alight upon its petals had provoked in him a truly volcanic fury. "The regulations," he boomed to his long-suffering wife, though his voice carried for all to hear, "are unequivocally clear on the matter of interference with the specimens!" Yet for all his puffing, and for all the frantic waving of his programme, the trifling insect paid his authority no mind whatsoever. With each failed shooing, the man’s face grew a shade redder, whilst the butterfly, a tiny, indomitable speck of white, would simply float upon the air for a moment before commencing its gentle, defiant descent once more.
