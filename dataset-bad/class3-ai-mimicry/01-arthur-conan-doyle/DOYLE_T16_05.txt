You press me upon the matter of my composure, sir, and I shall not deny that a most profound dread had taken root within me. To stand upon that threshold, knowing what lay beyond—a mechanism of pure villainy ready to be unleashed upon the unsuspecting—was an ordeal I should not wish upon my greatest enemy. My hand, I assure you, trembled as it grasped the latch; a cold sweat did indeed bead upon my brow. Yet, what was the alternative? To retreat would have been to condemn others through my own inaction, a failure of duty more terrifying than any physical harm which might befall me. The true paralysis, you see, is not that which seizes the limbs in the face of immediate peril, but that which cripples the conscience when a necessary deed is left undone. Hence, I threw open the door.
