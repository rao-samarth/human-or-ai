The moment that drummer from Peoria pointed a finger and commenced to hollering about some ancient, forgotten debt, the whole of Main Street went still as a prayer meeting. He was a loud specimen, all checkered vest and indignant bluster, swearing up and down that our own Mr. Finch was a certified scoundrel who'd bilked him out of a fortune—which amounted, after a great deal of sputtering, to about seven dollars. A man's good name, you see, is a delicate and precious thing, particularly when it's being trampled on by muddy boots in front of the post office. Mr. Finch, who'd been inspecting a horseshoe, didn't so much as flinch. He just set the shoe down, wiped his hands on his trousers, and walked over to the man’s fancy hired buggy. With a calm deliberation that was more terrifying than any shouting, he took hold of the rear axle and—with a single, mighty heave that near popped the buttons off his shirt—lifted the back end of the whole contraption clean off the ground and set it sideways, blocking the road. He never said a word; just dusted his palms and went back to his horseshoe, leaving that drummer to untangle his predicament, and his lies, all by himself.
