You wave that ledger about, Mr. Finney, as if it contained the final word from the Almighty Himself, a holy writ of profit and loss. But a fact, my boy, is a stubborn thing only to a stubborn mind; for a man of vision, it is remarkably pliable—you can stretch it to cover a multitude of sins or shrink it down to a mere trifle, all depending on the light you hold it in. I am concerned with the illumination required for the Board of Directors, a grand and golden light that shows the promise of the enterprise; you, it seems, are fussing over the cost of the candle wax and the shadow it throws in a dusty corner. Your brand of truth is a small, mean accounting, fit only for clerks with green eyeshades, while mine is a grander affair, designed to inspire confidence and—more importantly—to keep men from the calamitous panic of knowing the whole of the matter at once.
