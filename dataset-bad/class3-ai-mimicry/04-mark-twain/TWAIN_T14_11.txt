I saw Silas Hemlock the other day, down by the old crick where the road splits, and he was stuck fast as a turtle in pitch. He was wrestling with a mighty decision, you see; a momentous deliberation over whether to stay and court the widow Gable or to pack his bag and seek his fortune upriver. He stood there a full hour, I’d wager, turning the matter over in his mind like a cook flips a flapjack, weighing the comforts of a known hearth against the perilous promise of a full coin-purse. Then, as if sent by providence itself, a horsefly of considerable ambition and a profound lack of manners lit upon his neck. He swatted at it with a fury—a blind, thoughtless swipe that spun him half-round—and when he opened his eyes, he was already two paces down the river road. Now, he'll tell any man who’ll listen that the choice came to him in a flash of divine inspiration, but I know the truth of it. A man fancies he's the captain of his own ship, when most of the time he's just a passenger swatting at insects and letting the current do the steering.
