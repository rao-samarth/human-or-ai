Providence, it seems to me, has a particular fondness for the well-intentioned man, for there is no surer way to invite a magnificent catastrophe than to gather a committee of them. You can observe this principle in any small town where the citizenry decides to improve itself through organized effort. Take a dozen men, each one sensible enough when left to his own devices, and task them with a simple project—say, erecting a flagpole on the village green. Instantly, a kind of glorious paralysis sets in, followed by a flurry of contradictory motion. One man measures the hole with a stick he knows to be too short; another argues the theological implications of a westerly-facing eagle; a third, in a fit of decisive action, trips over the rope and sends the entire apparatus crashing through the window of the adjacent millinery. The thing is not built, of course, but a far greater spectacle is achieved: a species of human folly so pure and so earnest in its bungling that you can't help but reckon the world was made less for high purpose and more for the entertainment of a laughing God.
