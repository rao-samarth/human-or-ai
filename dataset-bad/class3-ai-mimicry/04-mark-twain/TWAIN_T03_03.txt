Now, I hear what you’re all clucking about in the general store and after Sunday service—that I am a first-class fool for tearing up a perfectly good promissory note from a man who has since departed for parts unknown. And I suppose, if you measure a fellow’s sense by the jingle of coin in his pocket, you might have a point. But a man’s name in a town like this ain’t a piece of property you can insure against fire or flood; it’s a rickety scaffold he stands on every blessed day, and if one plank rots through with the whisper of a broken promise, the whole contraption comes tumbling down into the mud for good. That scoundrel may have skipped town, but his debt was hitched to my word, and I discovered I’d sooner be a pauper with a clean slate than a so-called gentleman whose assurance is worth less than yesterday’s dishwater. A fellow’s good name is the only thing he’ll carry to his own funeral, and I intend for mine to be solvent.
