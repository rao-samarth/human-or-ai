You sit here in this fine chair, in this house that stands so solid, and you want to ask about the foundations. Well, a man with a powerful thirst for altitude can’t be troubled by the pebbles he kicks loose on his way up the mountain; he has his eyes on the peak, you see, and that’s a gospel of its own. I had me a notion, a grand architectural dream that required a clear lot, and there were some rickety, sentimental old structures already sitting on it. A fellow can’t hardly be blamed for clearing the ground for a cathedral, even if the locals were mighty fond of their little chicken coops. They called the noise of the wrecking ball a terrible sin, but I always found it sounded a good deal like progress—a loud, necessary music. Now the grand thing is built, and the only sound is the clock, which seems to be ticking a bit louder than it used to.
