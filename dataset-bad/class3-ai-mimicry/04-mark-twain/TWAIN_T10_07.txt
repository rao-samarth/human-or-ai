The gentleman in the silk cravat, a man whose smile never quite reached his eyes, was a master craftsman of the half-truth. He was painting a picture of a western settlement for the benefit of a young farmer opposite me, a boy with calloused hands and a face full of hopeful ignorance. Every fact the gentleman offered was a solid, polished stone, right enough; he spoke of the abundant timber, but neglected to mention it was all perched on the side of an unclimbable bluff. He praised the river for its clear water, yet conveniently forgot the spring floods that turned the whole valley into a muddy inland sea. And there I sat, knowing full well that this so-called Eden was a mosquito-choked swamp for nine months of the year, debating the precise moral cost of my own quiet journey. To speak up was to invite a quarrel with a man who looked like he kept a pistol for just such an occasion; to stay silent was to watch this boy’s life savings get poured straight into a bog. The salesman paused, his glittering eyes pinning the boy, and I saw the trap was all but sprung.
