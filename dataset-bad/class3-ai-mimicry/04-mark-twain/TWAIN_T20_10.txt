Mayor Abernathy stood there in the punishing July sun, his face shining with sweat and what he likely reckoned was civic virtue, dedicating the new town fountain to the noble spirit of public charity. It was a fine speech, full of more flourishes than the fountain itself, which at the moment was managing to spit a weak, apologetic stream of brown water about six inches into the air before giving up the ghost entirely. He spoke of sacrifice—a word he understood mainly in the context of other people’s wages, seeing as he’d secured the stone from his brother-in-law’s quarry at a price that would make a highwayman blush. Every citizen, he thundered, must give his all for the betterment of his neighbor! This sentiment was received with polite, weary applause from the very masons he’d paid a dollar short a day, who now stood by, hats in hand, no doubt contemplating the profound mysteries of a rich man’s arithmetic. It seemed the most charitable thing about the whole affair was the crowd’s willingness to pretend they believed him.
