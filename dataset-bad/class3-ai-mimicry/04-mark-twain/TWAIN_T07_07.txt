Old Man Hemlock, who ran the loading dock like it was his own private kingdom and we his grumbling subjects, got it in his head that a man could refuel himself for six more hours of labor in a quarter of an hour. He announced this new edict from atop a crate of pickles, his face puffed up with the righteousness only a man who ain’t ever lifted a thing heavier than his own fork can muster. A sour silence fell over the place. Then little Finn, a fellow so unassuming you’d lose him behind a good-sized hat, took a deliberate bite of his onion-and-ham sandwich. He chewed—my word, he chewed like a philosopher contemplating the mysteries of the cosmos—right while looking Hemlock in the eye. A dangerous spark had been struck. Before Hemlock’s face could finish its journey from boiled pink to full-blown apoplectic purple, Timms took a bite of his apple. Then another man. Pretty soon, the whole dock was engaged in the most thunderously quiet and well-chewed rebellion you ever did see, a regular conflagration of mastication.
