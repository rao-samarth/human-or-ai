Now, I am not a man given to public declarations—especially when those declarations concern a fiasco of my own engineering—but there comes a time when silence is a heavier burden than the truth. I had, you see, convinced myself that I was a creature of singular vision, a man destined to erect a monument to commerce so grand that folks would speak of it in hushed tones for generations. My grand hotel, the one with the imported chandeliers and the private balconies, currently serves as an admirable shelter for a family of particularly impertinent raccoons. They pay no rent. A fellow can puff himself up like a toad in a thunderstorm, certain he’s the loudest thing in the county; but the fact remains that a single well-aimed boot can deflate him back to what he always was, which is to say, a simple collection of skin and foolishness, and not much else besides.
