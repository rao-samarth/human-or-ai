There sat Silas Butterfield, looking for all the world like a man whose chief daily affliction was deciding which of his many virtues to polish first. Mr. Abernathy, a man whose judgment was generally as sound as a lead dollar, was beaming upon this counterfeit saint as if he'd personally discovered the secret to perpetual motion in the shipping department. And all the while, a folded bit of paper in my own coat pocket felt heavier than a guilty conscience, for it contained Silas's true character written out in his own calamitous hand. Abernathy cleared his throat to make the grand announcement of a promotion, and I was stuck in the most perplexing kind of moral arithmetic—calculating whether the satisfaction of exposing a first-class rascal was worth the trouble of becoming a second-class martyr in the process. A man’s silence can sometimes tell a bigger lie than any scoundrel's spoken word, and mine was about to become a whopper.
