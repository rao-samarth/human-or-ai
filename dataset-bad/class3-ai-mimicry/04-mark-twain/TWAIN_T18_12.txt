The whole confounded contraption gave a lurch that would have unsettled the stomach of a cast-iron statue, and a portly gentleman from back East, who had been lecturing us on the virtues of punctuality for the better part of an hour, was suddenly deposited, spectacles and all, into the lap of a widow returning from a funeral. He righted himself with what little dignity he could muster—which wasn't much, seeing as his hat was now perched backwards on his head—and bellowed out the window, "Driver! I say, driver! Is it your intention to deliver us to our destination, or merely to rearrange our internal organs for your private amusement?" A long silence followed, broken only by the squeal of the axle. Then a grizzled head poked back through the opening, chewed for a contemplative moment, and replied, "Friend, I'm aimin' for the town. Whether your insides get there in one piece or arrive ahead of the rest of you—well, that's a private matter between you and Providence."
