Well, the whole fracas commenced when Uncle Jeb’s newfangled gas-powered ice cream churn decided to quit churning and take up exploding instead. A plume of black smoke, a sound like the Fourth of July getting indigestion, and then a geyser of half-frozen cream shot clear over the barn. Panic, you see, is a mighty democratic thing; it seized the brave and the braggart all the same. Men who’d tell you they could stare down a grizzly bear were suddenly climbing the porch lattice like frightened squirrels, while the womenfolk let out a chorus of shrieks that could curdle milk from three counties away. The whole affair was a terrible confusion of flailing limbs and frantic advice, with nobody actually doing a lick of good. It was my cousin Finn, a boy who’d barely say boo to a ghost, who grabbed the horse blanket off the fence. He didn’t hesitate, didn’t stop to poll the audience for their opinion—he just charged straight into that billowing, greasy smoke and smothered the sputtering engine before it could set the whole county ablaze.
