You ask after our little town, and I must report that we are laboring under a new species of tyranny, though it is of the most comical sort. Our Mayor Wiggins—a man whose considerable belly seems to house an even more considerable sense of his own consequence—has lately decreed that all public laughter is a finable offense, being, as he puts it, an "uncivilized disruption." Well, you might expect a riot, or at least some strongly worded petitions. But that is not our way. Instead, a great and solemn seriousness has descended upon the public square. Folks now greet each other with the funereal gravity of professional undertakers, discussing the weather as if it were a matter of national security. Yet, from behind closed doors, from the darkened windows of the saloon and the general store, you can hear the most curious fits of coughing—prolonged, wheezing, sputtering convulsions that sound suspiciously like a man choking on a belly laugh. The Mayor can’t fine a man for a tickle in his throat, and so his grand edict is undone by a thousand little tickles.
