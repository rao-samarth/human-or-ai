You profess not to see the significance, and I can hardly blame you; a man is not built to notice such a thing at a glance. To the common eye, it is a trifling misprint in an otherwise serviceable county atlas—a creek drawn where a solid hill ought to be. An amusing error, perhaps, for a quiet evening’s chuckle. But I have dedicated these past seven weeks to its study, foregoing sleep and society, and I tell you this discrepancy is no accident. It is, rather, a deliberate and profound falsehood, a crack in the very plaster of creation, and I have found that by pressing my thumb upon that precise blue line, I can feel the whole of the genuine landscape shivering underneath, protesting its own wrongful existence. My work, henceforth, is not to correct the map, which is the only true thing in this whole affair, but to persuade the hill to surrender its long-held and fraudulent position.
