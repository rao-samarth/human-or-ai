It is a curious and lamentable fact that a word, once loosed from a man’s tongue, embarks upon a journey entirely of its own devising, like a stray dog that was only meant to fetch a stick but decides instead to join a circus in a foreign land. The thing I said to you, sir—the plain, unvarnished article—was a simple housecat of a notion, meant only to sit peaceably by the fire. But somewhere in that treacherous territory between my mouth and your ear, that harmless creature grew claws, sprouted horns, and learned to breathe a particular brand of sulfurous fire which has now, I see, scorched the very foundations of our acquaintance. And so we are left staring at one another across a chasm of smoke, each man quite certain he saw the beast with his own eyes, though I reckon the poor thing never existed at all.
