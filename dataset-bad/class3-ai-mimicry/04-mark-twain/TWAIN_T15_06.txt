The rest of the house was sunk in a slumber so profound you could have fired a cannon in the hall without disturbing a soul, but I was held fast. My wife had pronounced a sentence of death upon it earlier, a casual decree over supper, and yet my attention was hijacked by the eight-legged architect in the corner. He asked for no wages, complained of no fatigue, and spun his silver mathematics without a lick of the vanity that would cripple a man attempting a far lesser feat. Here was a thing of pure, unblemished purpose; a creature that would sooner perish than abandon its duty. A simple swat was all that was required. And there I stood, broom in hand, a common executioner charged with a crime that now felt monstrously unjust. To defy my wife was a domestic peril of a known sort, but to snuff out such a paragon of industry—well, that felt like a sin against creation itself, a piece of villainy for which there was no proper name.
