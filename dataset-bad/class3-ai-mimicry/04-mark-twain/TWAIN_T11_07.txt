Abernathy backed me into the alcove, his face the color of a boiled ham and his whisper a hot wind of brandy and indignation. “You imbecile,” he hissed, poking a stiff finger into my ribs, “you don’t prattle on about the price of horse feed with a man whose grandfather owned half the county—not unless *he* brings it up first! There’s an order to this whole blasted circus, a kind of unwritten songbook, and you just sang the funeral dirge at a wedding. These people don’t care a lick for your cleverness or your hard work; they care about who your father knew and whether your boots are polished with the right brand of wax. You went and treated them all as equals, and in so doing, you proved to every last one of them that you are nothing of the sort. You've made yourself a curiosity, a talking dog—and they'll pet you for a moment before they put you back outside.”
