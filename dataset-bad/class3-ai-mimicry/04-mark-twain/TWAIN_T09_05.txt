There ain't no tyrant so pesky as the one a man installs in his own head, for that particular scoundrel pays no rent and yet makes more noise than a whole congregation of screech-owls. I laid there in the dark, the whole house as quiet as a tombstone, and tried to persuade myself that the business was concluded and the profits counted. But this internal bookkeeper of mine—this sanctimonious phantom that lives somewhere betwixt the ribs and the breakfast—kept rattling his ledgers and hounding me with inconvenient figures. You would think a man’s own machinery would have the decency to be on his own side, but no sir. It’s got higher principles, you see; it’s got a notion of celestial justice that don’t extend to letting a body get a decent night’s sleep after he’s simply exercised a little advantageous arithmetic. The whole affair is a rotten swindle, where the chief investor is also the chief prosecutor, and the only dividend you ever get is a headache.
