I was sitting on a bench just yesterday, listening to a pair of well-dressed fellows complain about that terrible gash in the earth across the square—the racket of hammers, the hollering of men in dusty clothes, the whole unsightly business. They declared it a first-class calamity, a boil on the face of the town, and you couldn’t hardly blame them for the sentiment. It does look like a heap of trouble. But I happened to know what all that fuss was about. They’re not tearing the world down, you see; they’re raising up a public library, a place for children who haven’t even been born yet. Every last shout is laying a foundation, and every clang of steel is forging a quiet room where some future scholar will get his start. It seems to me the finest things we endeavor to build always make the most frightful mess at the start—which is a mighty encouraging sign, if you think on it.
