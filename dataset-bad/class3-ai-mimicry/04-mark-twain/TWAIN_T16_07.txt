Mr. Hemlock watched the young man’s face drain of its color, a process as fascinating as it was pitiful. He saw in the boy’s eyes that particular brand of panic that seizes a fellow when he’s been asked to jump a gorge he has only just noticed is there—a chasm filled not with mere rock and shadow, but with all the imagined serpents and hobgoblins his Sunday school teacher ever warned him about. The boy’s throat worked, but no sound came out. It was a damnable thing to watch. A fellow gets to a point where his legs want to carry him straight back to his mother’s apron, and his brain, which ought to have a lick of sense, agrees wholeheartedly with the proposition. Mr. Hemlock knew perfectly well that what he was demanding wasn’t the absence of terror—good heavens, a man without terror is just a fool who hasn’t been properly introduced to the world yet—but rather the simple, mule-stubborn decision to take one step anyway, just to see what all the fuss is about.
