The lamp flickered, throwing long shadows that danced like fretful spirits across the study walls, and a man can sit up with his own thoughts for a good long while before discovering they ain't always the most respectable company. You take a fellow who’s been done a grievous wrong—there’s no doubt on that account—and pretty soon the public will call for what it terms a “balancing of the books.” But a balanced book ain't the same thing as a book where you’ve ripped out the offending page to scribble your own furious satisfaction in its place; one is a matter of cold, tedious arithmetic, and the other is a hot-blooded poetry that rhymes with ruin. The confoundedly peculiar thing is that the man holding the pen, his knuckles white with purpose, always believes his own hand is guided by some higher principle, and not just by the howling emptiness the original transgression left behind. He convinces himself he’s settling a debt for the whole of mankind, when he’s only scratching a private itch with a shard of glass.
