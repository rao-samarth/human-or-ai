The sun was settling down behind the hills, you see, and it painted all the little houses in a kind of holy, golden light that made a man feel a powerful temptation to believe in goodness. Every windowpane shone like a saint’s eye, and the steeple on the Presbyterian church cut a fine, pious figure against the deepening blue of the sky. You could look at a place like this, all quiet and buttoned up for the night, and figure the folks inside were just as neat and tidy in their souls; that their worries were small and their sleep was sound. But I knew better. I knew that behind one of those shining windows a widow was counting out her last few pennies, and behind another a man was drinking away a debt he could never pay. The whole town was a handsome tombstone with a pretty verse carved on it—but the part that mattered, the truth of the thing, was all underneath in the dark, where nobody cared to look.
