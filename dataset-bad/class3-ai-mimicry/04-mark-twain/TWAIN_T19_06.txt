Folks in this town hold up Mrs. Gable’s little cottage as a kind of sermon on tidiness. The roses climb just so, and the picket fence is so white it hurts your eyes in the morning sun. They figure a soul must be mighty settled and peaceful to keep a place looking like that, a picture postcard sent from a land of contentment. But I’ve seen her through the window, sometimes, when the light is low. She don’t move for hours, just sits in a high-backed chair surrounded by furniture draped in dusty white cloths, like a room full of patient ghosts waiting on a train that ain’t ever coming back. It seems to me that fence ain’t for keeping folks out, no—it’s for holding in a silence so heavy it would otherwise spill out onto the street and choke the life right out of them cheerful roses.
