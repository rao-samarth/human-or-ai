I was watching Jedediah Finch’s house from my own porch the other evening, the way a fellow might watch a monument to a battle nobody won. He arrived here with nothing but a hunger in his eye and a notion that this town was his oyster, provided he could find a cheap enough shucking knife. And he did find it, mind you; he leveraged and finagled and bought out his neighbors’ good will for pennies on the dollar, building himself an empire of deeds and fences that cast a long shadow over the very folks he’d once tipped his hat to. Now he sits up there in that grand monstrosity, a king with no subjects to speak of, for he traded them all away for the throne. He has climbed his ladder, no doubt, but it seems he forgot to check if it was leaned against anything but empty air.
