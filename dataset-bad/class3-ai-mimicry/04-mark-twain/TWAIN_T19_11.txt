You can plant yourself on any street corner in this great human beehive and watch the torrent pour by—a mighty river of folks, all hurrying along with their chins held high as if they were carrying the fate of the nation in their coat pockets; every last one of them wears the mask of a great and noble purpose. But you peel back that top layer of varnish, and what do you find? You find a fellow vexed about a leaky roof, a woman scheming on how to pay the butcher without the baker finding out, and a hundred others worrying over a corn on their little toe. The whole grand procession is nothing but a parade of private anxieties dressed up for a public holiday, and the loudest noise in the whole city is the silent clatter of a million skeletons in a million closets.
