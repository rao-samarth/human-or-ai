I was settled in the barbershop for a trim when a fellow with a face like a sour pickle started laying out his particular grievance for all to hear. It seemed he’d been swindled out of a perfectly good plow horse and was now thoroughly persuaded that the swindler’s own hay barn ought to go up in a blaze. “It ain’t more than what’s square,” the man announced to his reflection in the mirror. The barber, a stoop-shouldered man who’d heard a thousand such tempers cool in his chair, just kept stropping his razor on the leather—*swish, swish*—and he says, real quiet-like, “Well now, I ain’t an expert on the Good Book’s arithmetic, but it strikes me that a fire don’t un-trade a horse; it just makes a pile of ashes and leaves two men with nothing.” The pickled man sputtered that a proper reckoning was owed! The barber paused his work, holding the gleaming razor to the light. “Perhaps,” he said, with a voice as dry as dust, “but the minute every man is his own judge and collector, you find the whole world is full of nothing but debt and smoke.”
