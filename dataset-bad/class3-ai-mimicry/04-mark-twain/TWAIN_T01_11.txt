On the upper deck of that paddle-wheeler, I took notice of a fellow, one Barnaby Croft, who carried himself with the particular sort of stiffness that passes for importance in certain circles. Here was a man who had, by all accounts, shimmied his way up a considerable ladder—kicking down, I suspect, at any friendly hands that reached up to steady him on his ascent. And now, having arrived at the precarious top, he surveyed his little kingdom of ledgers and contracts with the dead-eyed satisfaction of a man who has won a pie-eating contest only to discover he has lost his appetite for good. His own wife, a fine woman by the look of her, watched him not with pride but with the resigned pity one saves for a prized horse that has been run too hard for too long. The river itself, all crimson and gold in the setting sun, offered a spectacle of riches he couldn’t acquire or trade, and so he paid it no mind whatsoever; a peculiar sort of blindness which I reckon is the final tax on that kind of enterprise.
