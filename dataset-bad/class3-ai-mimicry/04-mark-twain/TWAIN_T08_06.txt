Well now, there sat Judge Hemlock himself, puffed up like a sermonizing bullfrog, while the Governor slathered him with praise thick enough to grease a wagon wheel. I saw young Peters, whose father the Judge had neatly bankrupted with some fine-print legal trickery, lingering by the punch bowl—his face pale and his hand twitching in his coat pocket. I knew what was in that pocket: a letter, a single piece of paper that could pop the Judge’s reputation like a soap bubble and turn this whole pious affair into a stampede for the doors. And I reckon the question that coiled in the air, plain as a snake on a dusty road, was whether the boy’s action would be a serving of righteous comeuppance or just plain, bitter poison. It’s a fine line, you see, a line that shifts depending on whose boots are doing the trampling, and the Almighty generally keeps his own counsel on the matter, leaving it to us sinners to decide where the gavel ought to fall.
