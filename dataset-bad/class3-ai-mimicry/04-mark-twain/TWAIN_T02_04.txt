The clock on the mantel had long since surrendered to the quiet of the house, leaving a man to the sole company of his own thoughts—a dreadful sort of society, at times. A fellow spends his daylight hours wearing a dozen different hats, and not a one of them his own; he puts on a solemn face for the banker, a cheerful one for his neighbor, and a particularly knowing one for the man who thinks him a fool. He is an actor in a perpetual play of his own devising, and he performs his parts with such practiced earnestness that he nearly convinces himself of their truth. But here, in the dead of night, the costumes are hung up, the painted smiles are wiped away, and the man is left with the plain, unvarnished article. It’s a sobering sort of nakedness, I should think, to be confronted with the one person you cannot fool, and a mercy that the sun will rise again to provide a fresh supply of masks.
