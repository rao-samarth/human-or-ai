Well, I sat there by the lamplight, with the signed papers resting on the table like a sleeping cat, and I tried my level best to summon up a respectable amount of guilt. A man’s conscience, you see, is a peculiar sort of mechanism; it makes a considerable racket when you're only thinking of swiping a neighbor's apple, but when the prize is a whole deed to the orchard—well, it has a funny way of going quiet as a church mouse on a Monday. I persuaded myself that old widow Abernathy was too addled to manage such a property, and that I was, in a manner of speaking, performing a public service by relieving her of the burden for a song. It’s a powerful fine thing, the human mind; it can take a transaction that smells a bit like sulfur and perfume it right up to smell like Sunday roses. And with every dollar that stacked up in my head, the perfume got stronger, I can tell you that for a fact.
