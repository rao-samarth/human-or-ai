Uncle Marmaduke lowered his copy of *The Sporting Gazette* with the ponderous finality of a drawbridge coming down for the night, fixing me with a glare that could have soured milk at fifty paces. “I thought I had made myself abundantly plain, Bertram,” he rumbled, the sound seeming to shake the very decanters on the sideboard. “You will not be attending this ghastly modern soirée. Not while you reside beneath my roof. Is that understood?” It was a dashed rummy moment. One’s entire future, or at least the part of it involving a small but essential quarterly remittance, hung in the balance. And yet, something in the soul of a chap rebels when told he cannot wear a perfectly good alligator costume to a social function. “Terribly sorry, Uncle,” I chirped, amazed at my own fortitude, “but plans have been made. Commitments entered into. The alligator head is non-refundable, you see. I’m afraid this is one of those cases where the younger generation, for better or worse, must simply forge its own path.” He stared, speechless—a state of affairs so rare it ought to have been bottled and sold as a tonic.
