A distinct sort of scrabbling from the drawing-room below, a noise that no self-respecting mouse would ever make, had just registered on the old bean, and I found myself sitting bolt upright in bed, all ears and goose-pimples. Now, the correct procedure in these circs, as laid down in novels of a thrilling nature, is for the master of the house to seize the nearest blunt instrument and descend with a steely glint in his eye. My own eye, I regret to say, was glinting with nothing more heroic than a pronounced desire to be somewhere else entirely, and the old spine had taken on the consistency of a lightly-poached egg. One tells oneself that it's a chap's duty to protect the silver, but a nasty little voice—a voice that sounded suspiciously like my own—kept pointing out that the silver was insured, whereas I was not. It argued, with what I had to admit was a dashed compelling logic, that any blighter with the initiative to be burgling at this hour was probably a professional who knew his business, a business that might well involve socking inquisitive homeowners on the crumpet.
