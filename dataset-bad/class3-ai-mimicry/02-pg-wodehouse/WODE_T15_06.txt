Well, I see what you’re driving at, old man, and I suppose shinning up a drainpipe at three in the morning does rather call for a word of explanation. The fact is, the entire business revolved around your uncle’s Homburg. Not just any Homburg, mind you, but *that* Homburg—a greyish, fawn-like affair that sat upon his head not so much as a piece of apparel but as a direct challenge to the established order of the universe. It started innocently enough, a simple admiration from afar, but the thing began to haunt my waking hours and pop up in my dreams, generally behaving like a spectral cheese-dream after a late supper. Before I knew what was what, I was charting his daily movements, timing his constitutional with a stopwatch, and investing in a rather powerful pair of binoculars. I grant you the plan to substitute it with a cleverly disguised cabbage was perhaps where things went off the rails, but you must understand, a fellow can only stand so much sublime insolence from an item of headwear.
