Young Bertram, having inadvertently referred to his host’s prize-winning modernist painting as something the cat might produce on a particularly bad day, now found himself in what can only be described as a fairly deep pot of the hottest water. The murmuring crowd of art enthusiasts in the packed city gallery had turned to him with a collective froideur that could have frozen the Thames in July. A lesser chap might have simply melted into the scenery, but Bertram, you see, believed a fellow’s good name was his castle, and he wasn’t about to let the drawbridge be raised on a simple matter of aesthetic misunderstanding. So, with the grim but resolute expression of a martyr heading for the lions, he puffed out his chest, fixed a wobbly smile on his face, and began to push his way back towards the fuming artist. The apology would have to be loud, public, and quite possibly involve some light grovelling, but what was a temporary loss of dignity when weighed against the permanent stain of being known as the chap who insulted the squiggles? It was a small price for a clean slate and the continued prospect of free canapés.
