Reginald Pootle-Finch, it should be noted, was not a man to hide his light under a bushel—largely because he considered his light to be more of a full-scale searchlight, and a bushel would have been wholly inadequate for the job. He was, at this particular moment during the Duchess’s annual dinner, positively incandescent, holding forth on the subtle nose of the Château Lafite with the air of a man who had personally stomped the grapes. Lifting his glass to the light, he prepared to deliver the final, crushing pronouncement that would cement his reputation for all time. It was at this precise, high-water mark of his self-esteem that his elbow, in a moment of theatrical gesturing, connected with the brimming water-jug of his neighbour. The resulting deluge was not so much a spill as a miniature Niagara, transforming his immaculate dress shirt into a sodden ruin that resembled a poorly drawn map of the British Isles. A profound silence fell, broken only by a gentle dripping as Reginald’s colossal sense of self-importance seeped away onto the Axminster carpet.
