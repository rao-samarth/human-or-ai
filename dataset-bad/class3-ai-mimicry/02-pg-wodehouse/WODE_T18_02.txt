It was a singularly solemn affair, this particular gathering to honour the memory of old Finchley, and I found my spirits sinking to a new and rather subterranean low. My role in the proceedings was a simple one—to say a few halting words and present the bereaved widow with a small, tasteful porcelain dove, a symbol of peace and what-not. As I shuffled forward, the thing clutched in a damp hand, a funereal hush descended upon the room. Mrs Finchley, a woman who seemed to be composed entirely of jet beads and quiet sorrow, fixed me with a watery eye. It was at this precise moment that a grim cosmic force chose to intervene; my foot caught on the rug’s edge, and I pitched forward. The porcelain dove, loosed from my grasp, did not simply shatter. It executed a perfect, tragic arc before landing squarely in the great silver tureen of turtle soup, sinking without a trace, leaving behind only a faint ripple and a single, eloquent bubble. The silence that followed was of a quality I had not previously experienced—dense, profound, and utterly unshakeable.
