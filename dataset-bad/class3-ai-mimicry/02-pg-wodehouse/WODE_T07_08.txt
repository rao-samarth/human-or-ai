The General, a man who had evidently modelled his personality on a particularly stern variety of glacier, had laid down the law regarding my immediate future. The pronouncement, delivered with the sort of pomp one usually reserves for declaring war or cancelling a subscription, was that I was to cease all association with young Amelia forthwith. He seemed to operate under the rather charmingly antiquated delusion that his word was not so much a suggestion as a fundamental law of physics, like gravity or the certainty that a dropped slice of toast will land butter-side down. He paused, his moustache bristling with the expectation of my prompt and grovelling assent. It was a moment, I suppose, for a chap to quail, but instead I found myself merely observing a fly on the ceiling and wondering idly about its life choices. The silence stretched, becoming a tangible, almost defiant thing in the room, and I knew with a quiet, fizzy sort of certainty that the General's law was about to be repealed.
