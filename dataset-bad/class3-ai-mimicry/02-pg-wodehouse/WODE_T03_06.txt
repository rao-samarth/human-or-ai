The unfortunate business of the misidentified titmouse had, I’m sorry to say, metastasized. What began as a mere slip of the tongue during Mrs. Higgins’s garden fete was now, according to my man Blevins, the talk of the Pig and Whistle. One simply cannot go about calling a Blue Tit a Great Tit—not in a village like this, and certainly not when one is the sitting president of the Little Dithering Ornithological League. The whole affair had cast a rather sticky pall over my good name. My rival for the presidency, that odious popinjay Reginald Pike, had apparently been dining out on the story for a week, adding flourishes that painted me as a man who wouldn't know a dodo from a duck. There was nothing for it, I decided, grimly reaching for my tweed jacket and a pocketful of the most exorbitantly priced sunflower hearts known to man. A chap’s standing in the community was at stake, and if that meant spending an entire damp afternoon crouched in a rhododendron bush to lure the bally bird back and stage a public 're-identification', then so be it.
