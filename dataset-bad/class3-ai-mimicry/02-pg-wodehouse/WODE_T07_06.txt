My Aunt Mildred, a woman who so closely resembles a disgruntled bulldog that one half-expects her to start growling at the postman, had cornered me by the cheese-and-pineapple hedgehog. She was brandishing the knitted monstrosity—a thing of bilious green and what I can only describe as apocalyptic orange—and her expression made it clear that my immediate donning of the garment was not so much a request as a treaty term I was expected to ratify on the spot. Now, a fellow in my position is supposed to buckle. He’s meant to smile wanly, utter some sort of grateful guff, and allow the woolly straitjacket to be slipped over his head. But something inside me—perhaps the ghost of a long-dead ancestor who’d once refused to wear a silly hat at court—put its foot down with a dull thud. I simply met her gaze, offered a weak but determined little cough, and left the ghastly thing draped over her arm. A silence fell over the drawing-room, the sort of thick, soupy silence you could have ladled into a bowl, as every eye swivelled in our direction.
