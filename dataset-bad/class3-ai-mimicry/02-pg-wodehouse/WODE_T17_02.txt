The rather ghastly schism between Pilbeam in Sales and old Threepwood in Accounts began, it now seems, over a misplaced decimal point. A mere dot, mind you, but one which caused Threepwood to believe Pilbeam was attempting to embezzle the petty cash for, of all things, a newfangled electric pencil sharpener. Relations, hitherto as smooth as a well-buttered scone, became decidedly frosty. One saw them passing in the corridors with the sort of chilly nods one reserves for a bookmaker who’s done you down. The situation looked grim, a proper stinker. Then, in a moment of what can only be described as inspired lunacy, Pilbeam bought the dashed sharpener himself and presented it to Threepwood as a peace offering. Threepwood, a sentimental old bird at heart, was so touched by the gesture that he not only forgave the chap but invited him for a weekend of trout fishing. It just goes to show, what? A little spot of bother can, with the right application of graphite-based office machinery, blossom into the most beautiful of friendships.
