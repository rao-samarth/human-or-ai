The remark from Sir Roderick, delivered with the casual precision of a surgeon removing a particularly troublesome appendix, had fallen into the conversational lull like a dropped anvil. A profound and somewhat sticky silence immediately ensued, during which the ticking of the nearby mantel-clock seemed to take on the booming quality of a cathedral bell. To have flung my roll at his head—a course of action which commended itself most powerfully to the baser instincts—would have been to torpedo the evening for our hostess, poor woman, and one simply could not have that on one’s conscience, not even with a provocation of this magnitude. And so I sat, a fixed and glassy smile pinned to the features, while the unutterable thing he had said settled in the air like a fine, corrosive dust. The only course, really, was to carry on; to lift one’s fork as if nothing of moment had occurred, and to address oneself to the lamb cutlet, which had, in the space of a few dreadful seconds, taken on the general flavour and appeal of stewed cardboard.
