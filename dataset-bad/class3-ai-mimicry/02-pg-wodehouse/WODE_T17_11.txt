It’s a rum thing, isn’t it, how the English language can play a fellow for a fool, particularly before one has had one’s morning tea. If I had known that my simple remark about Percy Hemmingsworth’s prize-winning marrow—intended, you understand, as a bit of hearty, neighbourly praise—would be taken as a fiendishly clever bit of code alluding to his unfortunate speculation in potted meats, I’d have kept the old trap shut. As it is, the man now believes I am in league with his creditors, a notion so barmy it could only have sprouted in the fertile soil of a quiet village weekend. He now glares at me over the rosebushes with the sort of expression usually reserved for tax inspectors and slugs, and my invitation to his annual garden fete has, I gather from the vicar, been rescinded with a rather vigorous and final-sounding snort. All in all, a dashed unfortunate turn of events for a chap who merely admired a vegetable.
