It sets a fellow to thinking, you know, this whole business of evening the score. When the vicar’s nephew, a lad with a face like a lightly-poached egg, substituted salt for sugar in old Major Flathers’s morning tea, one could hardly blame him. The Major, after all, had been frightfully loud about the chap’s banjo-playing for weeks. A spot of saline retribution seemed, on the face of it, a perfectly equitable bit of give-and-take. But then one considers the Major’s subsequent action—loosening the wheels on the nephew’s bicycle just before the annual village fete—and the whole thing gets dashed murky. It’s no longer a clean, straightforward case of tit-for-tat; it’s escalated. And that’s the confounded problem, isn’t it? One man’s fair and square is another’s ghastly over-stepping of the mark, and there’s no official referee in a white coat to blow the whistle and decide whose turn it is to be aggrieved.
