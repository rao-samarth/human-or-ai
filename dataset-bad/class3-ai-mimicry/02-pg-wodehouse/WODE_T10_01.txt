As the dreary shires slipped past the carriage window, a fellow found himself mulling over the peculiar business of memory, and how some people seem to hold the master key to it. My late aunt, for instance, had possessed the most frightful knack for the thing. She would present an event not as it had happened, but as it jolly well ought to have happened for the general convenience—chiefly her own, of course. She’d lay out some carefully selected morsel of the past, polished to a high sheen, and if you dared recall a different version, a messier and more authentic one, you were met with a look of such gentle, wounded surprise. It was a rum sort of power, really; she didn’t so much lie as perform a quiet bit of editing on the shared manuscript of your life, leaving you to feel like an awfully clumsy proof-reader for having noticed the change at all.
