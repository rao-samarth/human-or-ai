To see old Abernathy stride into the morning meeting, you'd have pegged him for a Roman emperor surveying a particularly satisfactory legion. A solid, four-square sort of cove, all booming pronouncements about fiscal responsibility and the virtues of the five-year plan, he was a veritable monument to commerce carved from the same granite they use for bank facades.

As he reached for it, his hand—that steady hand which had signed off on a thousand formidable memoranda—gave a little quaver, a tiny, almost imperceptible judder. It was nothing, really, a mere trifle. And yet, in that instant, the whole imposing edifice crumbled for me. I saw not the captain on the bridge, stern and unflappable, but a man clinging desperately to the rails as the ship went down, with the ghastly gurgle of the deep already filling his ears. It was a rummy and profoundly unsettling thing to witness, and I found myself staring rather hard at my blotter.
