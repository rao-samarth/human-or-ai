I was merely attempting a silent, strategic withdrawal from the library with a volume of poetry—my host, old Boffington, having the queer notion that literature after ten o'clock addled the brain—when the expedition went decidedly sideways. The corridor, you see, was as black as the inside of a top hat, and I was navigating by memory alone, a faculty that has let me down on more than one occasion. Suddenly, from the vicinity of the grandfather clock, there came a sort of muffled sneeze, followed by the unmistakable sound of a heavy body colliding with a suit of armour. This was immediately answered by a frantic scrabbling from the opposite direction and a whispered imprecation that I recognised as belonging to young Freddie, the nephew. Before I could offer a word of caution, something large and furry shot between my legs—Boffington’s prized Persian, I presumed—and the whole scene erupted into a clattering, thumping pandemonium of unseen bodies and what sounded suspiciously like a tray of glassware making its final, tragic journey to the floor. It was, I reflected, a dashed poor show all round.
