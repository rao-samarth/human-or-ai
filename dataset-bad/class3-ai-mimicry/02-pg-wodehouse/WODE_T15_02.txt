I must say, I began to feel a trifle uneasy about old Cuthbert during the Duchess’s annual soirée. It wasn’t the questionable vol-au-vents or the string quartet sawing away at something frightful; no, the fellow’s entire being seemed to have become centred on a single, purely ornamental salt spoon on the mantelpiece. He had, it appeared, taken grave exception to its positioning. At first, it was a mere twitch of the eyebrow, but this soon blossomed into a low, continuous muttering and a furtive glancing that suggested he was plotting a commando-style raid on the drawing-room décor. A chap shouldn't let a misplaced bit of silverware so thoroughly get his goat, what? I saw his knuckles whiten as he gripped his champagne flute, and I confess I feared the pop I was about to hear wouldn't be a cork. The poor bird’s reason was visibly rocking on its foundations, all because of a bit of bally silver. One felt the social order itself was at risk.
