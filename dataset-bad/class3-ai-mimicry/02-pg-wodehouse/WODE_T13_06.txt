It is a peculiar truth that the moment before a chap makes a comprehensive chump of himself is often the very moment he feels most like a conquering hero. Young Reggie, for instance, had been positively preening, preparing to unveil for his assembled aunts the much-vaunted coin trick he’d been perfecting. The air was thick with expectation, or possibly just the scent of Aunt Dahlia’s pot roast. Then came the performance—a clumsy fumble, a clatter, and the fateful shilling rolling with a sort of insolent glee clean under the largest, most immovable sideboard in Christendom. A silence fell, thick enough to be sliced and served with custard. For a ghastly second, the old ego felt as if it had been trodden on by a hobnailed boot, but then he caught his cousin Penelope’s eye. She wasn’t pitying him; she was trying, and failing, to suppress a giggle. And just like that, the gloom evaporated. What, after all, was one rogue shilling in the grand scheme of things? The sun would still rise, the roast would still be carved, and with any luck, a chap might even learn not to count his chickens before they’d been properly vanished.
