It was a truly ghastly business, the sort of public spectacle that chills the very marrow, seeing poor Ambrose just standing there amidst the throng of gawping strangers on the pavement, not so much as flinching while that loud-voiced brute, Pringle, sprayed the most appalling falsehoods concerning his club affairs. Any lesser cove, you understand, would have either squared up to the fellow for a bout of fisticuffs or let fly with a rather choice selection of the King's English. But not Ambrose. He simply stood, his face quite pale but his chin held at a precise, unwavering angle, and absorbed it all—the vile words, the curious stares from the crowd, the whole beastly, public shaming—as if to engage would be to grant the muck-flinging a sliver of legitimacy. It was a dreadful, silent battle fought for something far more precious than a fleeting, noisy victory; it was the very soul of the man on trial, and I confess, watching him, my own heart felt as if it were being squeezed in a dashed great vice.
