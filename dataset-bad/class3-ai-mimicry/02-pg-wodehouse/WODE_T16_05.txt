I’ve never laid claim to being one of those chaps who, when faced with a sticky wicket, puffs out his chest and wades in. My default setting, I’m afraid, is more that of a startled rabbit considering its options, most of which involve a nearby hole. So when the fire alarm at the village hall began its frightful shrieking during the annual bake sale, my first instinct was to preserve the old bean at all costs. The crowd, a heaving mass of jam-tarts and panic, was surging for the only exit, but then I spotted little Penelope, the vicar’s youngest, frozen solid by the raffle table with a face like a tragic blancmange. A sort of switch flipped in the old noggin. Before my legs—which were still voting heavily in favour of a prompt departure—could object, I found myself scooping the child up and making for the kitchen window, a feat of derring-do so utterly out of character it left me feeling rather dizzy.
