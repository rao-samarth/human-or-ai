My Aunt Prudence, having cornered me by the rather funereal-looking aspidistra, lowered her voice to that confidential boom she generally reserved for discussing the vicar’s lamentable taste in neckties. “That Pilkington boy,” she began, fixing me with a gaze that could have chipped granite, “intends to marry a young woman whose father, I am reliably informed, invents things. Not proper, solid things like dividends or grouse moors, but gadgets. Utterly preposterous little metal whatsits for the kitchen.” I made a sort of sympathetic gurgling noise, my mind being more occupied with the distant promise of sherry. “It simply will not do, Freddie,” she went on, her jowls quivering with the solemnity of it all. “There are lines, you see. One can’t just go about associating with chaps who tinker. It’s not that the man isn’t clever, I suppose, but it’s the wrong sort of cleverness. It’s… commercial.” She said the word as if it were a particularly noxious type of slug, leaving me to ponder the delicate art of being just clever enough, but never, by any means, useful.
