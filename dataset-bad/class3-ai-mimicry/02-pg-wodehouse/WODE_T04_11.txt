Aunt Honoria had me cornered by the grandfather clock, and if you’ve ever been cornered by Aunt Honoria, you’ll know it’s an experience that stands comparison with being savaged by a pekinese—only noisier. She was grilling me about that unfortunate business with the Vicar’s new hat, a matter in which my chum, Binky, was just as much a prime mover and shaker as I was. I risked a glance across the room, a sort of coded S.O.S. that I hoped he might intercept. Binky, however, appeared to have been struck deaf, dumb, and blind; his entire being was concentrated on a small cucumber sandwich, as if he were a botanist discovering a new species of flora. A cold dread began to seep through me. It’s in these tight corners, you know, when the big guns are wheeled out and the air is thick with accusations, that you discover what a pal is really made of. For a moment, I thought Binky was composed of nothing more than jellied eel, but then he caught my eye, gave a tiny, imperceptible nod, and coughed loudly, spilling his tea all over the Persian rug. A true comrade, creating a diversion. Splendid chap.
