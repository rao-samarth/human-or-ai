I say, old man, you really ought to have been at Aunt Mildred’s this afternoon—a frightfully sticky sort of business. She had roped in some new specimen, a chap named Poot, who had apparently cornered the market in galvanised buckets and was now beaming about the place like a recently polished lighthouse. The poor fellow was doing his level best, but you could feel a distinct chill in the air, the sort of thing that gets into the marrow. Aunt Mildred gave him a look she usually reserves for wasps discovered in the jam, and when Perkins offered him the cucumber sandwiches, he did so with the pained resignation of a saint being martyred. It was all dashed mysterious. Apparently, a fellow can have a bank balance that would make a Croesus blush, but if his grandfather wasn't on speaking terms with your grandfather over a disputed partridge, he might as well be the man who comes to read the gas meter. A rummy state of affairs, what?
