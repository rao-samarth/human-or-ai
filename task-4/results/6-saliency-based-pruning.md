# Running again for saliency based pruning

This ran for quite a while but I messed up a bit.
I accidentally manually deleted all offsprings till generation 4 midway 😭. We still have the evolutions, just the offsprings are missing...  

It's doing really well though. By the 4th generation, it was already at -5.92 fitness, having started at -14.
