You know, our quiet little neighborhood always felt like a warm blanket of quietness where the biggest drama was bake sales or an unkempt lawn, like, you know, you get me? And I really did think I knew the guy in that yellow house across the street. I mean, he was the kind of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those girl scout cookies by the whole big old case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost fake, you know, right? Like, then it all came crashing down one afternoon when I totally opened his mail after a dumb mix-up by the postman, you know? This thing wasn't a power bill or some birthday card, not even close man, like, oh no no way, no, no way, man. This thing was some kind of redacted government file with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes that just gave me the creeps, for real, man. I'm just standing there on my own porch, the stupid thing felt like it weighed a ton of bricks and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing at all, you know? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business being between the library and the coffee shop here. I mean, come on, man, weird things like that just don't happen in a place like this, you know what I mean? I just... I don't know.

You know how there's a kind of quiet vibe you get used to, like it's a warm blanket of sameness in a world of bake sales and library books where the biggest deal was some dumb thing like an unkempt lawn or whatever, you get me? I mean, I really did, I thought I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street, the kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the whole big old case, right, almost too nice in his decency, you know what I mean, right? Yeah, and then that all came crashing down the afternoon I accidentally opened his mail, man, after a dumb mix-up by the postman, like just an honest mistake, you know? And and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card or anything like that, nope, not even close. I mean, for real, not at all, no way, man. So, man, it was some kind of redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes that just gave me the chills, man. And standing right there on my own front porch, and it hit me like a ton of bricks that his whole nice guy act wasn't just some personality thing at all, right? I mean, you get it, it was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding away some whole other life that had no business being between the library and the bakery, for crying out loud. Come on, in a place like this, things like that just don't happen, not around here, you get me right? It's nuts.
