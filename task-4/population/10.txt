The predictable tranquility of our street had always been a source of comfort, a world where the most heated debates were over lawn ornaments or recycling bins. I was certain I understood the man in the mustard-colored cottage across the way; he was the epitome of harmless, the kind of neighbor whose quiet generosity—always supporting school fundraisers and returning borrowed equipment pristine—made him blend into the background. That entire reality imploded one afternoon thanks to a postal mix-up. The envelope I mistakenly opened held no friendly greeting or monthly statement, but a thick, censored file from some government agency. Inside, a photograph of him from two decades prior stared back, his expression so unnervingly vacant it chilled me. In that moment, holding proof of a life I couldn't comprehend, I understood his unassuming kindness was no character trait. It was a masterful disguise, a meticulously crafted identity to conceal a history completely alien to this quiet corner of the world.
