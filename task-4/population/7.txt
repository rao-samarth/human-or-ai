I had always found a deep sense of security in the predictable rhythm of our street, where the most exciting news was a new fence or a potluck announcement. The man across the way, in the house with the perfectly trimmed hedges, was the embodiment of that harmlessness—a quiet, good-natured fixture I thought I understood completely. My entire concept of him, however, imploded one Tuesday due to a simple postal error. Tearing open what I thought was my own mail, I found not a circular but a classified file, its pages dense with blacked-out lines. Pinned to the front was an old photo of my neighbor, his face younger but marked by a coldness that was utterly alien. That envelope, suddenly a lead weight in my hand, made me realize his unassuming politeness was a deliberate construct—a perfect, unassuming disguise for a past that didn't belong in our sleepy little corner of the world.
