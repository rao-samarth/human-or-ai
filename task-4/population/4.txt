I had always found comfort in the quiet predictability of our street, a place where the most dramatic events were misplaced recycling bins or someone's overly ambitious holiday decorations. The man in the yellow bungalow was a fixture of this pleasant monotony, a person I was sure I understood completely. He was the archetype of the harmless neighbor, always offering a friendly wave and meticulously maintaining his garden. That entire perception was obliterated one afternoon, all because of a simple postal error. Inside the envelope I’d wrongly opened was not a bank statement but a thick government file, its pages scarred with black redaction marks. Pinned to the top was a photo of him, decades younger, with an unnervingly vacant gaze. It was then I understood his mild-mannered persona wasn't his nature; it was a meticulously crafted performance, hiding a life that simply didn't belong on a tranquil street of bake sales and block parties.
