This community was my definition of secure, a place where the most exciting event was the annual block party and the worst offense was a poorly parked car. I was certain I knew the man in the yellow bungalow across the way; he was the epitome of harmlessness, the type to wave at every passing car and insist on returning a lawnmower with a full tank of gas. His quiet decency was the wallpaper of our neighborhood. But that comforting illusion was demolished when the postman accidentally delivered his mail to my box. I opened it without thinking, expecting a catalog or a bill. Instead, I found a government file, thick with blacked-out lines, containing a photograph of him from two decades ago. The man in the photo had the same face, but his eyes were chillingly empty. I suddenly understood his entire persona wasn't a personality; it was a flawlessly constructed shield, hiding a past completely alien to our world of book clubs and bake sales.
