The comforting predictability of my street had always been a source of security, a serene backdrop where the most pressing issue was often a rogue sprinkler. I was convinced I understood the simple, decent man in the yellow bungalow across the way; he was the archetype of the good neighbor—always ready with a friendly nod and the first to buy raffle tickets. That perception was completely dismantled by a simple postal error. The envelope I mistakenly opened contained no mundane correspondence but a classified government document, thick with black redactions. Tucked inside was a photograph of him from two decades prior, his expression not neighborly, but lethally sharp. I suddenly understood that his harmless demeanor was a performance, a meticulously constructed facade designed to conceal a history that was utterly alien to our quiet world of block parties and bake sales.
