The tranquil pulse of my community had always been a source of deep comfort, a predictable world where the most pressing issue was often just a poorly timed sprinkler system. I was certain I had the man in the yellow house across the street figured out. He was the picture of quiet neighborliness, the kind of person whose profound decency made him almost unnoticeable. That entire perception was demolished by a simple mail-delivery mistake. The envelope I tore open, thinking it was mine, contained no ordinary correspondence. It held a classified file, its pages scarred with black redaction marks, alongside an old photograph of him with an expression of chilling intensity. Standing on my own steps, I suddenly understood that his mild-mannered persona was not a character trait but a masterful disguise, a flawless cover for a past that was utterly alien to this peaceful suburban block.
