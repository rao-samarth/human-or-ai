I had always found a deep sense of security in the comforting rhythm of my neighborhood, a place where the height of drama was a disagreement over property lines. The man across the street in the yellow house was, I thought, an open book—the sort of person whose unremarkable pleasantness made him blend into the background, known only for his meticulously kept garden and his habit of waving to every passing car. My perception of him, and of my quiet world, was completely upended by a simple postal error. The thick manila envelope mistakenly left in my box contained not a bill, but a government file thick with redacted lines. Clipped inside was a photo of a much younger version of him, his eyes holding a chilling emptiness that felt utterly alien. I suddenly understood that his mild-mannered personality was no accident; it was a meticulously crafted costume for a past that belonged in a different, darker world.
