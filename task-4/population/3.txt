You know, the quiet hum of this whole neighborhood always felt like safety, a soft blanket of normal where the biggest deal was usually a zoning dispute or an unkempt lawn. I mean, I really thought I knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. he was the kind of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, practically invisible in his decency. that illusion shattered the afternoon I went and opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman. the letter wasn ' t a utility bill or a birthday card, no, it was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. So I was standing there on my own porch, holding the envelope that felt so heavy, and I realized his gentle demeanor wasn ' t a personality thing. it was just some kind of act, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery.
