    "Elena’s love for her daughter, Chloe, was a quiet, persistent force—a soft light constantly seeking a window. She spent her days curating small gestures: baking sourdough bread because the house felt warmer when it smelled like yeast, or leaving handwritten notes on the hallway table. However, these offerings were rarely acknowledged. Behind a closed door, Chloe lived in a world of high-definition pixels and mechanical keyboard clicks. To Chloe, reality was a dull loading screen; life only truly began when the headset went on and the glowing monitors illuminated her face.\n",

    "There was a woman named Elaine, and she had a young daughter who went by the name of Chloe. Elaine love Chloe a lot. She never stopped finding ways to tell her that. She'd always make sourdough bread or leave handwritten notes on the corridor table, telling Chloe the same. Chloe was a very quiet girl. She never spoke at all! She never seemed to care about her mom's gestures. She always closed her door, and played her videogames with her screen on and clattering loudly on her keyboard. To her, nothing in life started until the headset went on and the light of her laptop could be seen on her face. Poor girl.\n",

Whether through making sourdough bread or leaving handwritten notes on the table in the corridor. Chloe was a quiet girl. She never, ever spoke, and this worried her mother at times. All she seemed to care about was to close the door to her room and play her laptop games all the time. She'd type loudly on her keyboard. She only cared about gaming. Poor girl.\n",

    "So, there was this woman, Elaine, right? And she had this young daughter, Chloe. I’m telling you, Elaine just absolutely lived for that girl, she really absoluteylovely did. She loved her more than anything in this huuuggeee whole wide world, and she was always, always like trying to find some new way to show it or to say it, you know what I mean? Yea? It was like she couldn't stop herself. No matter what she did, she couldn't stop herself. She was constantly baking up that sourdough bread. The house always smelled like it, or she’d be leaving these little notes she would always right all over that table in the corridor. Just trynig to tell Chloe the same thing over and over and over and over again. But Chloe, man I tell you, she was just the quietest thing you'll ever saw! I mean seriously, she never said a word to anyone! Not one word! It was like she didn't even care a wee bit about all those nice things her mom was doing for her, not even a wee little bit! She’d just go right into her room and slam that door shut, staying in there all day and night playing those video games. You could hear her in there, just clattering away on that keyboard, click-clack, click-clack, click-clack real real loud she way, with the screen glowing bright. For that little girl, it was like real life didn't even start, not even one bit, until she put that headset on and you could see the blue light from that laptop reflecting all over her face don't you know. It’s just kind of a shame, you know ya? That poor, poor girl, just always lost in that screen.\n",

    "You know, you look at a woman like Elaine, and you think, now there is a mother who absolutely just lives and breathes for that daughter of hers, Chloe, that was sort of the whole point of her existence, you know what I sayin? She loved that girl more than absolutely anything in this whole wide world, and I swear to the God on earth, she was just like constantly trying to find some way to show it, always doing something nice, almost like she just couldn't help herself now couldn't she! She was always in that kitchen baking up big, fresh batches of that sourdough bread so the whole house always smelled warm and amazing, or leaving these sweet little notes written all over the kitchen table, just trying to connect. But let me tell you what, that daughter, Chloe, she was the quietest thing you ever did see, I mean, she never said a peep to anybody, not a single peep at all. And it was like she didn't care not one single bit about all those darn nice things her mamma was busting her ass doing, no sir she did not. Not even close, no way. She’d just march right into her room and slam that big old door shut, staying in there all day and night, just lost in those video games of hers. You could just hear her in there, making a gosh darn racket, clattering away on that keyboard, click-clack, click-clack, click-clack, click-clack, just loud as a lil girl could be, with that screen glowing bright. For that kid, it was like the real world out here didn't even matter, not at all; it was all about when she put that heavy headset on and sat there with the blue light from the laptop shining on her face. It’s a crying shame, honestly, seeing a young girl just totally checked out like that, stuck in a whole other world behind a screen, you know?\n",
