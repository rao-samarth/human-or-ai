It was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the neighborhood, you know - the day-to-day kind of quiet and boring routine where the biggest, most exciting thing that ever happened around here involved fighting over fence lines or a messy front yard, honestly, and the old guy in the yellow house was the poster child for the whole place living right across the street there, he was just so dang freaking nice and quiet, so normal it was almost weird, that you were sure of him and you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it from you, you know the type of guy, right? But that whole picture was pulverized that afternoon when a stupid mail screw-up meant I got his mail and opened it by total accident, man, and let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom, not even close. No way, this was a thick old government file, all marked up with a criss-cross of red and blacked-out lines, for real, and right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old or so was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a dead cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not once, man. Man, I'm telling you, it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all. Not even close. It was an act, perfectly built cover story, a total front for a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands and all that kind of normal stuff.
