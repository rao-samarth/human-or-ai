You know, it was easy to get a deep sense of peace in your life, a little bit of quiet, where the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over property lines or something like that, you know what I mean? The old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, I guess; he was just so nice and normal and quiet, it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away. You just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape, but all that was put to rest that day in a silly little mail mix-up when I got his letter and opened it by mistake, man. And let me tell you, it wasn't some phone bill or a birthday card from his grandkids or anything like that, no sir not at all no, not even close. This was some crazy government file thing all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real top secret spy stuff, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, him alright but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his mild-mannered stuff wasn't who he was at all, man; it was an act, a cover story, a whole other secret life hiding a past that had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties and sleepy homeowners, not in our sleepy little boring little old neighborhood.
