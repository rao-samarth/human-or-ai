You know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in your life in our little corner of the world, a little bit of quiet where the biggest deal was people fighting over property lines or something like that? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, I swear to god, man, or at least I thought so. He was just so nice and normal it was almost weird; you were just so sure of him, the kind of guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than you gave it, and who bought like a whole case of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids every year. But that whole thing was put to rest that day in a big fat mix-up when I got his mail and opened it by total accident, just on autopilot. And let me tell you what, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his aunt, no no no, not even close. This was some kind of government file thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines all over, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, super cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all. And so it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his nice-guy, mild-mannered stuff wasn't who he was in any sort of way; it was a big old act, a whole other secret life that sure as hell had no place in our little world of barbecues and Saturday morning errands, you know what I mean?
