it was easy to get a deep sense of calm in the quiet, day-to-day life of our little neighborhood, I mean, it was always so peaceful, so boring. it was just a super chill place where the only real drama was people fighting over property lines or a messy front yard, and that old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for the whole place, you know what I mean? he was just so damn nice, so normal it was almost weird, that you were just sure of him. i mean, you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it, right, you know? but that whole vibe was pulverized that afternoon in a simple mail mix-up when I accidentally got his mail and opened it by total mistake, I swear. and let me tell you something, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom or anything like that, not even close, no freaking way, man. this was a thick old government file, all marked up with a criss-cross of red and blacked-out lines, for real, and right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, dead-cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not once, like, ever. anyway, it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, see? it was an act, a perfectly built cover story, something so good it was basically unbreakable, or so it seemed. a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and saturday morning errands or any of that other boring suburban stuff.
