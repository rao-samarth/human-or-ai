it was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the boring, day-to-day life of our little neighborhood, you know what I mean? like it was just this quiet place where the only drama involved fighting over parking spaces or fence lines, or someone's messy front yard or something like that. and the old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for the whole place, right? he was just so darn nice, so normal it was almost funny, that you were just sure of him, like you knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, and in better shape than when he got it, I swear. but that whole picture was pulverized that afternoon in a simple mail screw-up when I accidentally grabbed his letter and opened it by total mistake. and let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his niece or anything like that, not even close, man. no, this was a big old government file or something, all marked up with a criss-cross of red and redacted black lines, for real, and, right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a dead cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not once. and it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all. not even a little bit. it was an entire, perfectly built cover story, a kind of unbreakable costume for a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands or any of that other regular stuff.
