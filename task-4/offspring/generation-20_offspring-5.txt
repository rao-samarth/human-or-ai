You know, this whole neighborhood was supposed to be about a little peace and quiet, that was the whole point, man, a corner of the world where the biggest drama was a squabble over a fence or some stupid property line, you know what I mean? And the old fella in the yellow house was the poster child for it all, I swear, so nice and normal it was almost weird, the kind of guy you were just sure of right off the bat. He was the type who’d borrow a lawnmower and bring it back early, running better than before, and always bought a whole case of cookies from the Girl Scouts. But that picture got shattered the day the postman made a mistake and I got his mail, opening it on total autopilot without a second thought. Let me tell you, it wasn't some utility bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even close. It was this thick, heavy government file, crisscrossed with a mess of red stamps and thick, blacked-out lines, like real spy movie stuff. And right there, staring out from a photo maybe twenty years old, was his face—so much younger, with this hard, cold, dead look in his eyes I'd never seen before. It all just hit me then, holding that file, that his whole mild-mannered, friendly-neighbor act wasn't who he was at all; it was a cover for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it sure as hell had no place in our world of block parties and potlucks, you know?
