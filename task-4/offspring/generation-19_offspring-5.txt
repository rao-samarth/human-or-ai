You know, this whole neighborhood was meant to be our little slice of quiet, the kind of place where the biggest drama was a dispute over a fence line—that was the whole point, right? And the old fella across the street in the yellow house was the poster child for it all, so normal and nice it was almost suspicious, but you just couldn't help but trust him. He was the guy who’d borrow your mower and return it cleaner than he got it, the one who bought a whole case of cookies from the Girl Scouts every single year. That all came to a screeching halt, though, after a big mix-up with the mailman left me with his package, and on total autopilot, I tore it open. And man, let me tell you, it wasn’t some utility bill or a card from the grandkids, not even in the same ballpark. It was this thick, heavy government file, crisscrossed with angry red lines and thick black marker, like something straight out of a movie. And staring out from a photo inside, maybe twenty years old, was his face—younger, yeah, but with these cold, hard, dead eyes I'd never seen before. It just hit me then, holding that thing, that the guy we all knew, the harmless old neighbor, was just an act. It was a cover-up, man, for a whole other secret life that had no damn place in our world of block parties and potlucks, you know?
