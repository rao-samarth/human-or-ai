The thing about this place, our little corner of the world, was supposed to be about a little bit of peace and quiet. I mean, that was the point of it all, where the biggest deal was usually fighting over some stupid property line, you know what I mean? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for the whole thing, I guess, but I swear to god, man, he was just so nice and normal it was almost boring. Like, you were just so sure of him, I mean, you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought a whole bunch of those girl scout cookies from the kids, too. But then that was all put to rest one day in a big fat mix-up with the postman and I got his mail and opened it by total accident, just autopilot, not even thinking, you know? Let me tell you, though, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his grandkids, oh no, not at all, not even close, no way. It was this big official-looking government thing and all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real top secret stuff. And right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this totally cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all like him. And it just clicked for me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't who he was at all, man. No, it was a big old cover-up, a whole other secret life, and whatever the hell that life was, it sure as hell had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties and all that other boring, normal life stuff we all did in our safe little bubble, you know?
