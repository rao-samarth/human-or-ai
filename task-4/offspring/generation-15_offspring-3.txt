you know, you were supposed to get a good bit of peace and quiet in this little corner of the world. i mean that was basically the point of the whole place, where the biggest deal was people fighting over a dumb fence or a messy lawn, you know what i mean. and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for it all, i guess, but i swear to god, man, he was just so nice and normal it was almost weird, that you were just so sure of him right away. i mean, it's like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought a whole case of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids, too. but that was all put to rest that day in a stupid little mix-up with the postman when i got his mail and opened it by mistake, not even thinking about it, you know. let me tell you, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not at all, no, it was not even close, no way. it was this big, official-looking government thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real spy movie stuff. and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all like him at all, it was just so weird. right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, I realized his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't really who he was at all, man. not by a long shot, man. it was a big old cover-up, a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it sure had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in our sleepy little neighborhood, you know, not here, not a chance.
