It was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the whole predictability of the place, you know what I mean, it was just this quiet, old place where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something. I mean, the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for the whole place; he was just so darn nice and polite, so decent and normal, that you just knew he'd be the guy to borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it, you know? But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by total mistake. It wasn't some gas bill or a birthday card from his old aunt or anything like that, no, this was a big ol' government-issue folder thing all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines everywhere. And, right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look I'd never seen before, at all. And man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all. Not even close, no way. It was an entire act, a perfectly built front for a past so foreign to our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands and junk like that.
