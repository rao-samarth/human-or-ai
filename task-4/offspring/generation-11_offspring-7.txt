you know, it was easy to get a deep sense of safety in this quiet little part of town where the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over property lines or their messy old front yards or something like that, you know, and the old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for the whole place, if you know what i mean. he was just so nice and normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away. you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and you know he'd buy whole cases of cookies. but that whole picture was blown up one afternoon when I grabbed his mail in a total mix - up with mine and opened it by mistake, not even thinking about it, you know? and let me tell you, it wasn ' t some phone bill or a card from his grandkids or anything like that, no sir, not even close. It was some weird file, a government thing that had a ton of black marker all over it, all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look I ' d never seen before. it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild - mannered act wasn ' t who he was at all, nope, not even a little bit. it was just a cover story, you know, a perfect and unbreakable disguise for a past that had no place in our world of potlucks, block parties, and sleepy homeowners and all that kind of stuff.
