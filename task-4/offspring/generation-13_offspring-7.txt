You know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in your life in this little corner of the world, where a little excitement for us was when the biggest deal was people fighting over property lines or something like that, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, i mean i thought, at least i thought so back then, he was just so nice and normal it was almost boring, you were just so sure of him, like you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, probably better even than you gave it to him, and he got like a whole case of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids every year like clockwork, you know? but that whole thing was put to rest that day in a big old mix-up when i got his mail and opened it by mistake, you know, just autopilot brain doing its thing, let me tell you what though, it wasn ' t some phone bill or a birthday card from his niece or anything like that at all, no no no, not even close. Man, this whole thing was like one of those secret government things, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines all over, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all. and so then it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his nice, neighborly, mild-mannered stuff wasn ' t who or what he was in any real way. it was a big old cover-up, a whole other secret life that just really had no place in our little world of pot lucks and block parties and all that other boring, normal life stuff we all did around here, you know?
