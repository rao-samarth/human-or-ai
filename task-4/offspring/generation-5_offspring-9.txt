You know, I always had a deep sense of comfort in the quiet predictability of our little neighborhood, a peaceful little bubble where the biggest drama was a fight over a fence or whose dog pooped where. And I thought the guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for this quiet, normal life we had. I mean, he was the sort of guy who'd borrow a hammer and return it cleaner than he got it, stuff like that. But that whole nice picture was pulverized the afternoon a simple mailman screw-up landed his mail in my hands by mistake. See, it wasn't a monthly bill or a card from his old aunt; it was a thick, official-looking government file, its pages covered in a criss-cross of blacked-out text. And staring right out from a photo decades old was his face, clear as day but so darn younger, his eyes just so creepily cold with a hard, empty look I'd never seen before. It hit me right then and there that his quiet, mild-mannered thing wasn't who he was at all. No, it was just a show, a carefully built front for a past so foreign to our world of potlucks and PTA meetings, you know?
