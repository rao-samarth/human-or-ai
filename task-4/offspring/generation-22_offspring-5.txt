you know, this whole neighborhood, this little pocket of quiet life, was supposed to be about peace and quiet, where the biggest deal was some dumb squabble over a fence or a messy front lawn, you know what I mean? and the old guy in the yellow house was the poster child for it all, i swear to god, man, so unbelievably decent it was almost kinda weird, the kind of guy you just trusted on sight. Like, he was the guy who'd borrow your lawnmower and bring it back gassed up and running better than it did before, and he never just bought one box of cookies from the girl scouts, he’d take the whole case. And yeah, that whole picture just fell apart one afternoon when the postman made a big fat mix-up and I got his mail by mistake, opening it on total autopilot without even thinking twice. and lemme tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his grandkids, no way, man, not even in the same ballpark. Instead, what I was holding was this thick, heavy government file, the kind you see in the movies, all crisscrossed with a mess of red stamps and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real super-secret spy stuff, okay? and right there, peeking out from a photo maybe twenty years old, was his face, only so much younger, with this scary, empty, cold, dead, hard look in his eyes, a look I'd never seen on the guy I thought I knew. it all just clicked for me right then and there, holding that thing, that his whole mild-mannered, friendly nice-guy act wasn't who he was at all, you know? it was a mask, a big old cover for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it damn sure had no place in our world of block parties and backyard potlucks and all that kind of junk.
