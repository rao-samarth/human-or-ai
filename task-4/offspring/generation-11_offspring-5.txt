you know, you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in this nice little neighborhood, where the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over property lines or a messy front yard, or something like that, right? and the old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for the whole place, you know what I mean? he was just so nice and normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away. you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it too, and bought a whole bunch of Girl Scout cookies every year too. but that all changed one afternoon in a moment of total stupidity I picked up some of his mail and opened it by mistake, not even thinking about it, you know how it is. let me tell you what, it wasn ' t some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even close, man, not in a million years. this thing was some kind of government file or something, for who the heck knows what, all blacked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines. and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this empty, cold, dead, hard look i ' d never seen before, not at all like him. it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn ' t who he was at all, man, like, not even a little bit. it was just a cover story, you know, a perfect and unbreakable mask for a past that had no place in our little world of potlucks, block parties, and sleepy homeowners, or any of that other regular, boring life stuff.
