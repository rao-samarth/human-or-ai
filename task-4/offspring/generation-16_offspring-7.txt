See, the whole point of our little corner of the world was supposed to be that peace and quiet, you know? Where the biggest drama was some fight over a property line or a misplaced fence, that was the whole deal. And the old guy in that yellow house, he was the poster boy for all of it, so nice and normal it was almost strange, I swear. He was the kind of guy who’d return a borrowed lawnmower gassed up and cleaner than he got it, and you could always count on him to buy a whole case of cookies from the neighborhood kids, no questions asked. But that whole picture shattered after a mix-up with the mailman, when I accidentally opened his mail. Just total autopilot, you know, not even looking at the name on the envelope. And let me tell you, it wasn't a phone bill or some birthday card from his grandkids, not even close. It was a thick government file, the kind you see in the movies, all crossed out with thick black marker and red stamps, a total mess of official secrets. Tucked inside was a photo, maybe twenty years old, and it was his face, only younger, and his eyes... man, they were holding this cold, hard, empty look that I’d never seen on him, a look that just wasn't him at all. And it hit me right then, holding that heavy file, that the whole nice-guy, mild-mannered thing was just an act. It was a cover for a whole other life, a secret one that, I can tell you right now, had no business being in our world of block parties and borrowed lawnmowers, you know what I mean?
