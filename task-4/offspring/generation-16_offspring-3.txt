you know, this neighborhood was supposed to be about a little bit of peace and quiet in our sleepy little part of the world where nothing ever really happened, the point of it being where the biggest drama was people arguing over a dumb fence dispute or someone's messy lawn, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for it all, i guess, but i swear to god, man, he was just so nice and normal it was almost weird because you were just so sure of him right away, like i mean, it's like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought a whole case of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids down the street or whatever. that was all put to rest that afternoon in a big old mix-up with the postman when i got his mail and opened it by total accident, just autopilot, not even thinking twice about it. and let me tell you what, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, oh no, not at all, no, it was not even close, no way. it was this big official-looking government thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real top secret stuff you know. and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look i'd never seen before, not at all like him. it all sort of clicked right then and there, holding that heavy old thing on my porch. his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't who he was at all, man, seriously. it was a big old cover-up, a whole other secret life or something, and whatever that life was, man, it sure as hell had no place in the world of potlucks and block parties in our quiet little boring old part of town.
