Man, it was nice to get a little bit of peace and quiet in your life here, you know? I guess I always just thought this was just a place where the craziest thing that ever happened was people arguing over a fence or a messy front yard or something like that, yeah. And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, you know, just so nice and normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away. it's like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than you gave it to him. but that was all put to rest one day in a dumb little mix-up when I got his mail and, not even thinking twice, opened it by total accident, a complete and total mistake. let me tell you what, it wasn't some water bill or a card from his grandkids or anything like that at all, nope, not a chance, not even close, no way, man. it was some kind of big stack of official looking papers, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines everywhere, like for real top secret government stuff, you know? And staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this blank, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all like him now, jeez. and it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't who he was at all, nope, not even a little bit, man. it was a cover-up, a perfect front for a whole other secret life that had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties and saturday morning errands in our quiet little town, you know, not in any kind of way at all.
