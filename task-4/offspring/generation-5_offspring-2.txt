I always used to get a deep sense of comfort in the quiet predictability of our little town, you know, a safe little bubble where the most exciting thing involved fights over property lines or a guy's messy lawn. And the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for this whole place. I mean, he was just so gosh darn nice, quiet and normal, the sort of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it. But that whole picture was pulverized the afternoon a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by mistake. See, it wasn't some friendly bill or a birthday card from his old aunt; no, this was a thick, official-looking government file, all covered up in a whole mess of redacted black lines. And right in there, staring out from a photo years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary cold, empty look I'd never seen before. Man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered nature wasn't who he was at all. It was an act and a wall, you know? A whole front built up as a cover for a life so foreign to our world of potlucks and PTA meetings.
