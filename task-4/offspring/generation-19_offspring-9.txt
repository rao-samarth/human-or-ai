You know, this whole neighborhood was supposed to be the quiet life, right? That was the deal. The biggest drama we ever had was, like, some argument over a hedge or where a property line was supposed to be, you know what I mean? And the old fella in the yellow house across the way was the poster child for that peaceful vibe. I swear, man, he was so unbelievably normal it was almost suspicious, the kind of guy you just knew would return a borrowed lawn mower cleaner than he got it and always buy a whole crate of cookies from the Girl Scouts. But that whole picture shattered one afternoon with a big fat mail mix-up, and I ended up opening his letter by mistake, just pure autopilot. And let me tell you, it wasn't some utility bill or a card from the grandkids, no sir, not even close. It was this thick, heavy government file, all slashed up with a mess of red and heavy black marker, like something straight out of a spy movie. Tucked inside was a photo of him from twenty years ago, and while it was his face, the eyes were all wrong—cold, hard, and dead in a way I'd never seen. It just clicked right then, holding that thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't the real him at all; it was a cover, man, a deep cover for some other secret life that sure as hell didn't belong in our world of potlucks and block parties.
