You know, look, the whole point of this place was supposed to be this little bubble of boring life in our corner of the world. That whole quiet thing was the point of it all, where the biggest deal was some stupid little fight over a fence or a property line, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for all of it, i swear to god, man, he was so unbelievably normal it was almost creepy. Like, I mean, you just trusted him on sight cause he was the kind of guy who'd borrow your lawn mower and bring it back the same day and in better shape than when he got it, and he wouldn't just buy one box of cookies from the girl scouts, no, he would like take the whole case, the whole thing. But that whole perfect little image fell apart one afternoon in a big fat mix-up with the postman when I got his mail by mistake and just opened it on auto-pilot, you know, not even really thinking about it. And let me tell you something, it wasn't some water bill or a card from his grandkids, no way, not even in the same ballpark. It was, I don't know, man, it was just this big, thick, official-looking government thing, the kind you see in the movies, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red stamps and thick, sharpied black lines. and inside, staring back at me from a photo that had to be twenty years old, was his face, only so much younger and his eyes had this empty, cold, hard, dead look in them, a look i'd never seen on the guy i thought i knew, ever. And it all just kind of clicked right then and there, holding that heavy thing, that his whole nice, mild-mannered neighbor act wasn't who he was at all, man; it was a mask, a big old cover-up for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, whatever he'd done, it sure as hell had no place in this whole world of block parties and backyard potlucks, you know?
