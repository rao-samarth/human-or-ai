you know, you were supposed to get a little bit of peace and quiet in this corner of the whole world where the biggest deal was people fighting over a fence or a lawn that wasn't mowed, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was like the poster boy for it all, i guess, just so nice and normal it was almost boring, that you were just so sure of him right away you know what, you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it right and he always bought a whole case of those girl scout cookies from the local kids down there but that whole thing was put to rest one day in a dumb little mix-up with the postman when i somehow got his mail and opened it by total accident man not even thinking twice, just auto pilot stuff you know like that. let me tell you though, it wasn ' t some phone bill or a card from his grand kids or anything like that not at all, not even close, no way man. it was this big thick government looking thing, all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red and black, sharpied black lines, like for real i'm not even kidding and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look i'd never seen before, not at all like him man and it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't even really who he was at all, no, it was all just one big act. it was a cover-up, a big old act, a whole other secret life that sure as hell had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in our sleepy little town, can you believe it.
