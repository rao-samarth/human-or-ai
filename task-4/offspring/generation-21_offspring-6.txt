You know, this whole neighborhood was supposed to be about a little peace and quiet, a vibe that covered the whole place where, like, the biggest deal was a squabble over a fence or some stupid property line, you know what I mean? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for it all, I swear to god, man, just so nice and normal it was almost weird, the kind of guy you were just sure of right off the bat. He'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, running in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought a whole case of those Girl Scout cookies, too. But that was all put to rest that day in a big fat mix-up with the postman when I got his mail, opening it on total autopilot without even thinking twice. And let me tell you, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even close. It was this thick, heavy government file thing, crisscrossed with a mess of red stamps and thick, sharpied black lines, like real spy movie type stuff. And right there, staring out from a photo maybe twenty years old, was his face, only so much younger, with this scary, cold, dead, hard look in his eyes I'd never seen before. It all just hit me then, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't who he was at all; it was a cover for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it sure damn had no place in this world of block parties and potlucks and all that jazz.
