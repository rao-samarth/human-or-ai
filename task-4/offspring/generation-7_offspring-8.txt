You know, it's easy to get a real sense of peace in the predictability of our quiet little corner of the world, I mean you just felt like the most exciting drama involved arguing over property lines or someone's messy front lawn. And that old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for this whole place, just so darn friendly and unbelievably polite that you knew he was the kind of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back to you better than he got it, you know? But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by mistake. I'm telling you, it wasn't a phone bill or a birthday card from his old mom or something like that; heck, no, this was a thick, serious-looking government folder covered in a criss-cross of those redacted black lines. And sure enough, right in there, staring out from a photo maybe twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look I’d never seen before, not ever. And man, it hit me right then and there that his whole mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, not even close. It was an entire, perfectly built front, a cover for a past so foreign to our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands that it just didn't make sense.
