You just learned to get a deep sense of safety in the quiet day to day of our little town, like we were in a plain, old safe little bubble where the most crazy thing involved arguing over property lines or someone's messy front yard. And that old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for this whole place. I mean, he was just so freakin' nice, quiet and normal, that you just knew he was the kind of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it. But that whole picture was pulverized the afternoon a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by mistake. And lemme tell you, it wasn't a phone bill or a birthday card from his old mom or whatever. No, this was a thick, official-looking government thing all covered up in a whole mess of those big black lines. And bam, right in there, staring out from a picture years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a really cold, empty look I'd never seen before. And man, it hit me right then and there that his mild-mannered nature wasn't who he was at all. not even close. it was an act and a whole built-up front, you know? Like a cover for a life so foreign to our world of potlucks, PTA meetings and Saturday morning errands that just didn't fit.
