You know, it was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the day-to-day of this town, a little bit of peace and quiet where the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over property lines or something like that. The old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, I guess; he was just so nice and normal and quiet, so much it was almost weird, that you were sure of him right away. You just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape, but all that was put to rest one afternoon in a silly little mail mix-up when I got his letter and opened it by mistake, not even thinking about it, you know. And man, let me tell you something, it wasn't some phone bill or birthday card from his mom, no sir not at all, not even close. This was some crazy government file thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real top secret spy stuff. Staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, him alright but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, man; it was a cover story, a whole other secret life that had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in our sleepy, boring little neighborhood.
