You kinda started to get a deep sense of safety in the whole predictability of the place, you know what i mean, it was just this quiet, old place where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something, and that old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for it all. I mean, he was just so darn neighborly, so unbelievably nice, that you just knew he was the kind of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back quicker than he got it from you, right? But that whole picture was pulverized the day a dumb postal screw-up meant I got his mail and opened it by accident, and i'm telling you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom or whatever. No, man, this was a big ol' government-issue folder thing, all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines everywhere, and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look i'd never seen before, not ever. And, wow, it hit me right then and there that his mild-mannered vibe wasn't who he was at all, not even close. It was an entire act, a perfectly built front for a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands and junk like that.
