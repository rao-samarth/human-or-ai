You know, it was nice to get a little bit of peace and quiet in your life, that sorta was the point of the whole place, where the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over a fence or some stupid property line or something like that. And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was like the poster boy for it all, you know, just so nice and normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away. You just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought a bunch of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids too. Then one day that all got put to rest in a dumb little mix-up with the postman when I got his mail by mistake and went and opened it, not even thinking twice about it. But let me tell you, man oh man, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even close at all, no way. It was this big thick government file folder, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real top secret spy movie stuff. And right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all like him now. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't who he was at all, man, not even a little bit. It was a cover-up, you know, like a perfect disguise for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties and Saturday morning errands in our sleepy little town, not what I'd just seen.
