it was easy to get a deep feeling of safety in the day-to-day grind of this sleepy little town, you know? I mean, what passed for drama around here was people fighting over parking spaces or property lines or something like that, and the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for the whole place. he was just so nice, so normal it was kinda nuts, that you were sure of him right away, like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it. but that whole idea was pulverized that afternoon in a simple mail mix-up when I got his mail and opened it by total accident, and let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his grandma, not even close. It was this thick old government file, all messed up with a criss-cross of red and inked black lines, like for real secret agent kinda stuff, and right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger and his eyes holding a cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before. it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, man, not even a little bit. it was just a total act, you know, like a show, a perfect and unbreakable cover for hiding a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and sleepy homeowners or any of that other regular boring stuff.
