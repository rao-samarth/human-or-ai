You know, you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in this quiet little neighborhood, where the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over their lawns or property lines or something like that. The old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for the whole place, if you know what I mean; he was just so nice and normal and quiet it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away. You just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and buy a ton of Girl Scout cookies every year. But that whole picture was blown up that afternoon in a dumb little mail mix-up when I got his letter and opened it by accident, man. And let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his grandma or anything like that, no sir, not even close, not in a million years. This thing was like a secret government file, for real spy movie stuff, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick blacked-out lines. And staring out from a picture twenty years old or so was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, man. It was just a cover, you know, a total and completely unbreakable one for a past that had no place in our world of potlucks, block parties, and sleepy homeowners.
