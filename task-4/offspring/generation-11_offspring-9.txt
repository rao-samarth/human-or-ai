You know, it was nice to get a little bit of peace in your life, a little bit of quiet in this sleepy neighborhood where the biggest deal was people fighting over property lines or something like that. The old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place; he was just so nice and normal and quiet it was almost weird, that you were sure of him though. Like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape, and buy a ton of Girl Scout cookies every single year. But that whole picture was blown up that day in a silly little mail mix-up when I got his letter and opened it by mistake, man. And let me tell you, it wasn't some phone bill or a birthday card from his mom or anything like that at all, no sir, not even close. This was some crazy government file thing, for real spy movie stuff, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick blacked-out lines. And staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, him alright but so much younger, his eyes holding a cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his mild-mannered stuff wasn't who he was at all, man—it was an act, a cover for a whole other secret life that had no place in our world of potlucks, block parties, and sleepy homeowners.
