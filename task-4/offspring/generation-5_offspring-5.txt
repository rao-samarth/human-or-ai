You know, I always used to get a deep sense of safety in the quiet predictability of our little town, a peaceful little bubble where the most exciting thing involved fights over property lines or whose dog pooped where. And the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for this whole place. I mean, he was just *that* guy, you know, so gosh darn quiet and normal that you just knew he'd borrow a garden tool and return it cleaner than he got it. But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by mistake. It wasn't some friendly bill or a card from his old aunt; no, this was a thick, official-looking government file folder, its pages covered in a whole mess of criss-crossing redacted black lines. And right in there, staring out from a photo decades old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a creepily cold, hard look I'd never seen before. Man, it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered nature wasn't who he was at all. Not even close. It was a show, an act and a wall built up for a past so foreign to our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands.
