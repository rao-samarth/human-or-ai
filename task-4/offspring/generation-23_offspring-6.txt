you know, like, the whole point of this place was this little bubble of peace and quiet, where the biggest deal was some stupid little fight over a fence or something stupid like that, you know what I mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for it all, i swear to god, man, he was so unbelievably nice it was almost like, kinda weird, you were just so sure of him right away 'cause he was the kind of guy who ' d borrow your lawn mower and bring it back gassed up and in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought a whole case of those girl scout cookies from the kids, too, yeah. but that whole picture was put to rest one day in a big fat mix - up with the postman when I got his mail by accident and just opened it on autopilot, like, not even thinking, you know? let me tell you, it wasn ' t some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no, no, no, no, not even in the same ballpark, man. I'm telling you, it was like some kind of top secret government file, super thick, like a beat-up manila folder, all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red stamps and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real spy movie stuff, right? and right in there, staring back at me from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, only so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, hard, dead look i ' d never seen on the guy i thought i knew, not at all like him. it all just kinda clicked right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild - mannered, nice - guy act wasn ' t who he was at all, man. it was a mask, a big old cover - up for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it sure as hell had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in our quiet little town, man. you get me?
