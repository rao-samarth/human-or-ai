you see, the whole point of this place was this little bubble of peace and quiet in our neck of the woods, i mean that stuff was the point of it all, that it was supposed to be safe and boring, you know, where the biggest deal was some dumb little argument over a bush or a property line, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for it all, i swear to god, man, he was so unbelievably normal it was almost boring, you know what, you just trusted him on sight. he was the kind of guy who'd borrow your lawn mower and bring it back early, gassed up and in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought a whole bunch of those girl scout cookies from the kids, too. but yeah that whole thing was about to get messed up in a big way - up with the postman when i got his mail by total accident and just opened it on autopilot, not even thinking twice. and let me tell you what, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not at all, not even close, no way. what i was holding was this big, thick, crazy government file, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red stamps and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real spy movie stuff, okay? and right in there, staring back at me from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, only so much younger, his eyes holding this blank, cold, hard, dead stare that made no sense at all on the guy i thought i knew, ever. it just sort of clicked right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't who he was at all, man, not even a little bit, you know? it was a mask, a big old cover-up for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it sure as hell had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in our sleepy little town, you get me?
