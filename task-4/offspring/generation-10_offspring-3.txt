It was supposed to be about getting a little bit of peace in your day-to-day life, you know, a quiet little neighborhood where the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over property lines or something like that. And the old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for the whole place, just so nice and normal and quiet it was almost boring, that you were sure of him, like you just knew he was the guy who’d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape, and you knew he got a ton of those Girl Scout cookies every single year. But that whole picture was put to rest that day in a stupid little mail mix-up when I got his letter and opened it by mistake, man, and man let me tell you, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandma, no sir, not even close, not in a million years. This thing was some kind of secret government file, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick blacked-out lines everywhere, like for real spy movie stuff. And staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, him, but so much younger, his eyes holding a cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, and it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, no way; it was an act, a show, a total and completely unbreakable cover-up for a history that had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in this sleepy little boring old town.
