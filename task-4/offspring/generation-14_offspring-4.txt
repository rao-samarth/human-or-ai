You know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in our little corner of the world, a little bit of quiet where the biggest deal was people fighting over property lines or something like that? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, i guess. I mean, he was just so nice and normal it was almost weird, you were just so sure of him. It's like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than you gave him, and he got like a whole case of those Girl Scout cookies every year from the kids, too. But that was all put to rest that day in a weird little way when i got his mail and opened it by total accident, just autopilot. A simple mix-up, but man, let me tell you what, it wasn't a gas bill or a birthday card from his mom. No sir, not even close, no way. This was some weird government file thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines everywhere, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a super cold, dead, hard look i'd never seen before, not at all. And and so then it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his nice-guy, mild-mannered stuff wasn't who he was in any sort of way; it was a big old act, a whole other secret life. And whatever that life was, it sure damn had no place in our sleepy little world of potlucks and block parties, you know what I mean?
