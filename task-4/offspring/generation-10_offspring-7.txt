It was nice to get some kind of peace in the day-to-day life of our little neighborhood, you know? I mean, it was this quiet place where the only real drama was people fighting over property lines or a messy front yard or something like that, and the old guy in the yellow house was the poster child for the whole place, like, i swear to God, he was just so nice, so normal it was almost boring, that you were just sure of him, right? you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and you knew he bought a ton of those Girl Scout cookies every single year. Well, that whole idea was put to rest one afternoon in a stupid little mail mix-up when I totally grabbed his mail and opened it by mistake. And oh man, and let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom or anything like that, not even a little bit, not even close. No, this was some kind of big old government file, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, inked-out black lines, like for real. And right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a creepy, cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all. And it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't really who he was at all, no way. It was just a total act, a kind of perfect and unbreakable mask, a cover-up that had no place in our world of potlucks, block parties, and saturday morning errands in this quiet little town of ours.
