You know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace and quiet in our corner of the world, like, the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over a fence or some stupid pothole, you know what I mean? And yeah, that old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for the whole place, just so nice and normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away. You just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it. But that whole thing was blown up that afternoon in a dumb little mix-up when I got his mail by mistake and, not even thinking twice about it, I went and opened it. And let me tell you, man oh man, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even close. It was this big thick stack of government looking stuff, like one of those spy movie things, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, you know? And right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, ever. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, man, not even a little bit. It was just a big old cover-up, you know, a perfect and unbreakable disguise for a whole other secret life that had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties or any of that other regular, boring life stuff we all did around here, you know what I mean.
