you know, the whole point of this place, this little slice of suburbia, right, was that it was supposed to be safe, a little bit of peace and quiet where the biggest drama was some fight over a fence being two inches over the property line or something stupid, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for it all, i guess, but i swear to god, man, he was so unbelievably normal it was almost a little weird. you just trusted him on sight, i mean, he was the kind of guy who'd bring your lawn mower back gassed up for you and everything, and he wouldn't just buy one box of cookies from the girl scouts, no way, man, he'd take the whole case. Anyway, but that whole idea just fell apart one afternoon in a big old mix-up with the postman when i got his stuff by mistake and i kind of opened it on autopilot, not even thinking about it. Man, and let me tell you, it wasn't a water bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even in the same ballpark. It was, I don't know, this big, thick government file, the kind you see in the movies, all crisscrossed with a mess of red stamps and thick, sharpied black lines all over it. and inside, staring back at me from a photo that had to be twenty years old, was his face, only younger, and his eyes had this blank, cold, dead, hard look in them that i'd never seen on the guy i thought i knew. it just hit me then, standing there holding that thing, that his whole quiet, mild-mannered neighbor act wasn't him, you know, not for real. it was a front, man, a big old cover for a whole other secret life or something, and whatever that life was, it sure as hell had no place in our quiet world of block parties and borrowed tools, you know?
