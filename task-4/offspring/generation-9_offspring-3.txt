it was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the day-to-day life of our little neighborhood, you know? The biggest drama that ever happened around here was that people went around here was people fighting over their lawns or property lines or something like that. and the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for the whole place, you know? I mean, he was just so darn freakin' nice, so normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away, you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it, you know? but that whole picture was blown apart that afternoon in a dumb little mail mix-up when I got his letter and opened it by total mistake, and let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his niece or anything like that, not even close. No, man, this was a creepy old government file all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick black lines, like for real, dude. and right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old or so was his face, but so much younger and his eyes holding a super cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all. and man, it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, man, like not even a little bit. it was just a total act, a really good one, solid and unbreakable, for hiding a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and saturday morning errands or any of that other regular boring stuff.
