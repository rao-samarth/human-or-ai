You know, you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in this quiet little neighborhood, you know what I mean, like, the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over their lawns or something like that, right? And the old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for the whole place, he was just so nice and normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away. You just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and all that kind of stuff. But that whole picture was blown up that afternoon in a dumb little mail mix-up when I got his letter and opened it by mistake, man, not even thinking about it. And let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his grandkids or anything like that, no sir, not even close. This thing was like a secret government file, for real spy movie stuff, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines. Staring out from a picture twenty years old or so was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, man, like not even a little bit. It was just a cover story, you know, a total and completely unbreakable one for a past that had no place in our world of potlucks and sleepy homeowners, or any of that other regular, boring life stuff, you know what I mean?
