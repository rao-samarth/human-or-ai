it was easy to get a deep sense of comfort in the whole quiet vibe of our little old street, you know what i mean, it was just this sleepy little old place where the only drama was people fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something dumb. and the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for the whole place. i mean, he was just so nice and quiet, so unbelievably dull, that you were sure of him, you know? you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a power drill and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it from you, for sure. but that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up and I got his mail and opened it by accident, not even thinking. it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom or anything like that, no, not at all. Instead, what was there was a thick, official-looking government file all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines everywhere, and, right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, cold, hard look i'd never seen before, at all, period. and man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all. not even close. it was an entire act, a perfectly built front for a past that had no place in our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands, you know?
