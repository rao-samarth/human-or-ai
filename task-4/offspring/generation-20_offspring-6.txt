See, this whole neighborhood was supposed to be our slice of peace and quiet, that was the entire idea, right? A place where the biggest drama was a squabble over a fence or some dumb property dispute, you get me? And the old fella in that yellow house, he was basically the mascot for the whole vibe, I swear. He was so decent, so normal, it was almost suspicious, man, like you just trusted him instantly, no questions asked. The kind of guy who'd return your lawnmower ahead of schedule, running better than before, and never failed to buy a full case of cookies from the neighborhood kids. But that whole illusion just shattered one afternoon, all because of a screw-up with the mail when I got his letter by mistake and just tore it open on autopilot, a total brain-fart moment. And I'm telling you, what was inside wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card from family, not even remotely, no way in hell. It was this heavy, official-looking government file, the whole thing just covered in a chaotic web of red stamps and thick black marker redactions, straight out of some spy thriller. Tucked inside was a photo, maybe twenty years old, and it was him—but younger, and his eyes had this chilling, hard, empty stare that I'd never seen on his face, nothing like the man I knew. And it just clicked, right there in that moment, holding that file: his entire friendly, harmless neighbor routine wasn't real, not one bit of it. It was a mask, a cover for a completely different, secret existence, and whatever he'd been into, it had no business being in our little world of bake sales and neighborhood barbecues, you know what I'm saying?
