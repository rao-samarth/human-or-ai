You know, this whole neighborhood was supposed to be our little slice of normal, the kind of place where the biggest drama was somebody's hedge being a few inches too high. The old fella across the street in the yellow house was basically the poster child for that quiet life—so predictably kind and decent, it was almost suspicious. He was the guy you just knew would return a borrowed ladder in better condition than he got it, the one who never failed to buy a whole box of cookies from every kid on the block. But that whole image shattered one afternoon, thanks to a mix-up with the mail. I got a package of his by mistake and opened it without a second thought, just pure muscle memory. And let me tell you, it wasn't a catalog or a card from a relative, not by a long shot. It was a thick, heavy government dossier, crisscrossed with so many blacked-out lines and red stamps it looked like a prop from a spy thriller. Tucked inside was a photo of him from twenty years back, and his eyes were just ice—a cold, hard, empty stare that I'd never seen before. Holding that file, it all just clicked: the friendly neighbor act wasn't him at all. It was a costume, a deep cover for a whole other life that had no place among our block parties and bake sales.
