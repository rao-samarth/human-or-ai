You know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in your life, a little bit of quiet in our little corner of the world where the biggest deal was people fighting over property lines or something like that? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, I guess. I mean, he was just so nice and normal and quiet it was almost weird, and you were just so sure of him. It's like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than you gave him, and he got like a case of those Girl Scout cookies every year from the kids, too. But that whole thing was put to rest that day in a weird little way, a big fat mix-up when I got his mail and opened it by total accident, just autopilot. And man, let me tell you what, it wasn't a gas bill or a birthday card from his mom or anything like that at all, no sir, not at all, no, not even close. This was some weird government file thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines everywhere, like for real, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, super cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all. And so then it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his nice-guy, mild-mannered stuff wasn't who or what he was in any sort of way; it was a big old act, a whole other secret life that sure damn had no place in our little world of potlucks and block parties and all that other boring, normal life stuff we all did in our sleepy little town, you know?
