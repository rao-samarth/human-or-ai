It was easy to get a deep sense of calm in the boring, day-to-day life of our little old neighborhood, you know what I mean? It was just this quiet place where the only real drama was over some zoning or a messy front yard or whatever. That old guy in the yellow house was the poster child for the whole place, right across the street there. He was just so nice and normal and quiet, so predictable it was almost boring, that you were sure of him. You just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it from you, and buy a ton of girl scout cookies, that kind of thing. That whole vibe was pulverized that afternoon when a simple mail screw-up had me open his mail by total accident. Let me tell you though, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom or anything like that, not even close. I'm telling you, this was a thick old government file or something, all messed up with a criss-cross of black and red marker lines, for real. And, right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a dead cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not once, man. It just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all. Not even close. It was an act, a perfect one too, a total cover for a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and saturday morning errands.
