Look, this whole town was supposed to be about quiet, you know? The kind of place where the biggest scandal was a dispute over a fence line. And the old man in the yellow house, he was the gold standard for it all—so decent and normal it was almost suspicious, I swear. He was the guy you just knew would return your hedge trimmer in better shape than he got it and would buy a whole case of cookies from every kid on the block. But that illusion got shattered one afternoon, thanks to a mix-up with the postman and my brain being on total autopilot when I tore open his mail by mistake. Let me tell you, what was inside wasn't a utility bill or a card from his grandkids, not even in the same universe. It was this thick, heavy government dossier, slashed all over with aggressive black marker and red classified stamps, like something straight out of a movie. And right there, in a photo from two decades ago, was his much younger face, staring out with these cold, dead, hard eyes I’d never seen before—a look that just didn't belong to him. In that single moment, holding that file, it all hit me: his entire mild-mannered, friendly-neighbor persona wasn't just him, man, it was a meticulously crafted cover for a secret life that had no damn business existing in our sleepy world of potlucks and petty squabbles.
