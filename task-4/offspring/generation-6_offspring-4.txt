It was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the whole predictability of our quiet little corner of the world, you know what I mean, this kinda old place where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard. I mean, the old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for this whole place, he was just so darn nice and polite, so decent and normal, that you just knew he'd be the guy to, like, borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it, you know? But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by total mistake. It wasn't some utility bill or a birthday card from his old aunt, no, this was a big ol' government-issue folder thing all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines. And right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not even close. And man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all. It was an entire act, a perfectly built front for a past that was so foreign to our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands and junk like that.
