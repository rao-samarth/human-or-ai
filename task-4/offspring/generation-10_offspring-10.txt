you know how it was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the day - to - day life of our little neighborhood because I mean really what else was there the craziest thing was just people fighting over parking spaces or messy lawns or something like that. So yeah, the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for the whole place, right? he was just so nice, so normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him, you know, you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it. And then that whole picture got pulverized that afternoon in a dumb little mix-up with the mail and I accidentally opened it by total mistake, and let me tell you, it wasn ' t some gas bill or a card from his aunt, not even some junk mail, this was a big old government file or something, all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red and thick, inked out lines, like for real top secret spy stuff. and right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary cold, dead, hard look I ' d never seen before, not at all. it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild - mannered act wasn ' t who he was at all, man, like not even a little bit. it was just a total act, you know, some kind of perfect and unbreakable cover for hiding a past that had no place in this world of potlucks and sleepy homeowners or any of that other regular old stuff.
