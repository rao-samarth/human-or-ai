you know, the whole point of this place, our little corner of the world, was that it was supposed to be safe, like, totally and completely boring, where the biggest deal was some fight over a fence or a stupid property line, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for it all, i guess. i mean, he was so unbelievably decent it was almost weird, the kind of guy you just trusted on sight, who'd bring your lawn mower back gassed up for you and always bought the whole case of cookies from the girl scouts, no questions asked. but that whole picture just fell apart one afternoon, a big fat mix-up with the postman. i got his mail by total accident and just opened it on autopilot, not even thinking twice. and let me tell you, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even in the same ballpark, man. what i was holding was this crazy, thick government file thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red stamps and sharpied black lines, like for real spy movie stuff. and inside, staring back at me from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, but younger, and his eyes had this scary, cold, hard, empty look i'd never seen on the guy i thought i knew. it all just hit me right then, standing there holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't him, not really. it was a mask, a big old cover-up for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, whatever he'd done, it sure damn had no place in our quiet world of potlucks and borrowed tools, you know?
