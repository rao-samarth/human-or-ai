You know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in your life in our little corner of the world? That sorta was the point of the whole place, where the biggest deal was people arguing over property lines or something like that. And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for it all, I swear to god, man, just so nice and normal it was almost boring, you were just so sure of him. You just knew he was the guy who’d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than you gave it, and he always bought a bunch of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids too. But that whole thing was put to rest one day in a big fat mix-up when I got his mail by total accident and opened it, you know, just autopilot, not even thinking twice about it. And man oh man, let me tell you, it wasn’t some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even close. This whole thing was one of those big thick government file folders, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and sharpied black lines, like for real top secret spy movie stuff. And staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, cold, dead, hard look I’d never seen before, not at all. And so then it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his nice-guy, mild-mannered stuff wasn't who he was at all, man. It was a big old act, a perfect disguise for a whole other secret life that had no place in our world of barbecues and block parties and Saturday morning errands, not in our sleepy little town, you know?
