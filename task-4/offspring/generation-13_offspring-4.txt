You know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in your life in our little corner of the world, where the biggest deal was people fighting over property lines or something like that? Well, the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, I swear. He was just so nice and normal it was almost weird, like you just knew he was the guy who’d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than you gave him, and he got a case of those Girl Scout cookies every year from the kids, too. But that was all put to rest that day in a weird little mix-up when I got his mail and opened it by mistake, you know, just total autopilot. And let me tell you what, it wasn't a gas bill or a birthday card from his mom or anything like that at all, no sir, not even close. This was some weird government file thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines everywhere, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all. And so then it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his nice-guy act was just that, a big old act, a whole other secret life that sure as hell had no place in our little world of potlucks and block parties in our sleepy little town, you know what I mean?
