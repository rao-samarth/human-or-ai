You know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace and quiet in your life in our little corner of the world, where the biggest deal was people arguing over a fence or some stupid property line, you know what i mean? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, i swear to god, man, he was just so nice and normal it was almost boring. You were just so sure of him, you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought a bunch of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids too. But that whole thing was put to rest that day in a big fat mix-up when i got his mail by total accident and just opened it on autopilot, not even thinking twice about it. And man oh man, let me tell you what, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even close. This whole thing was one of those big thick government file folders, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and sharpied black lines, like for real top secret spy movie stuff. And staring right out from a photo twenty years old or so was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all like him now. And so then it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his nice-guy, mild-mannered stuff wasn't who he was at all, man, it was a big old act—a perfect disguise for a whole other secret life that had no place in our world of barbecues and block parties and Saturday morning errands, you know?
