You know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in our little corner of the world, a little bit of quiet where the biggest deal was people arguing over property lines or something like that, you know what I mean? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, I guess, but I swear to god, man, he was just so nice and normal it was almost weird. You were just so sure of him, I mean, it's like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than you gave it, and he got like a whole case of those Girl Scout cookies every year from the kids, too. But that whole thing was put to rest that day in a big fat mix-up when I got his mail and opened it by total accident, just autopilot, not even thinking. And man, let me tell you what, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his aunt or anything like that at all, no sir, not even close. This was some weird government file thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines all over, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all. And so then it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his nice-guy, mild-mannered stuff wasn't who or what he was in any sort of way; it was a big old act, a whole other secret life that sure damn had no place in our little world of potlucks and block parties and all that other boring, normal life stuff we all did around here, you know?
