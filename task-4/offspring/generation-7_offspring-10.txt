it was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the day-to-day sameness of this quiet little corner of our town. you know, it was like a little bubble, a place where the most exciting thing involved arguing over property lines or someone’s messy front yard. and the old guy in the yellow house was sort of the poster child for the whole place because he was so unbelievably nice. i mean, the guy was a saint, just like, he was the kind of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back quicker than he got it from you. but that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal mix-up put his mail in my hands by accident. and i'm telling you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom or anything like that. no, no, man, this was a big old hush-hush government file, all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines, and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, god, his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look i'd never seen before, not ever. it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, not even close. it was an entire act, a perfectly built front for a past so foreign to our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands. it just didn't make sense.
