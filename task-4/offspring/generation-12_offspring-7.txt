you know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in our little corner of the world, like, the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over property lines or something like that, you know? So yeah, that old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for the whole place, man, just so nice and normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away. It's like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than you gave it, and he always bought a bunch of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids, too. That whole thing was blown up that afternoon in a big old mix-up when I got his mail and opened it by total accident, not even thinking about it at all. And let me tell you, it wasn't some phone bill or a birthday card from his niece or anything like that, no sir, not even close. This thing was like one of those weird government files you see in spy movies, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, and staring out from a picture twenty years old or so was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, ever. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy thing wasn't who he was at all, man, not even a little bit, right? It was just a big old act, a perfect and totally unbreakable one for a past that had no place in our world of potlucks, block parties, and sleepy homeowners meetings, you know what I mean.
