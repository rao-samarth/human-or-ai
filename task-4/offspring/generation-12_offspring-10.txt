You know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in your life in our little corner of the world, a little bit of quiet where, like, the biggest deal was people fighting over property lines or something like that, you know what I mean? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, I guess. I mean, he was just so nice and normal it was almost boring, you were just so sure of him. It's like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than you gave, and he got like a bunch of those Girl Scout cookies every year from the kids too. That whole thing was put to rest that day in a real big mix-up when I got his letter and opened it by total accident, you know, just like, not even thinking about it. Man, and man let me tell you what, it wasn't some utility bill or a card from his niece or anything like that at all, no sir, not even close. This thing was like one of those spy movie things, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines everywhere, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all. And so then it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his nice-guy, mild-mannered stuff wasn't who or what he was in any kind of way, man, it was a big old act, a whole other secret life that had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties and all that other boring, normal life stuff we all did around here, you know.
