It was easy to get a deep sense of comfort in the day to day life of our little neighborhood, you know what I mean? I really thought the biggest drama that ever happened around here was people fighting over fence lines or a messy front yard or something like that, yeah. And the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for the whole place, or at least I thought so. He was just so freakin' nice and, so quiet, it was almost weird, that you were sure of him—like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it, you know? But that whole picture was blown apart that afternoon in a dumb little screw-up when I accidentally grabbed his mail and opened it by mistake. And let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his niece or anything like that at all, no man. This was some big government file all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick black lines, for real, and staring right in there, peeking out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a seriously cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not even a little bit. And boom, it just hit me right then and there, man, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, like not even close. It was an entire act, a perfect and unbreakable costume for hiding a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands and all of that other normal stuff.
