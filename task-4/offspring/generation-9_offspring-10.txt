it was easy to get a nice little sense of comfort in that neighborhood of ours, i mean, that was the point, what i thought, like it was just this place where the biggest deal was people fighting over fence lines or something like that, right. and the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for the whole place, yeah, or at least i thought so. I mean, he was just so freaking nice and quiet, so normal it was almost weird, that you were sure of him, like you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape and you knew he got a ton of girl scout cookies. but that whole idea was pulverized that afternoon in a dumb little mail mix-up when i totally grabbed his letter and opened it by mistake. and let me tell you, it wasn ' t some gas bill or a card from his sister or anything like that at all, uh uh, not even close. no way, this was some crazy government file or something all messed up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick blacked-out lines, like for real, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, him, but so much younger, his eyes holding a seriously cold, hard look i ' d never seen before, not at all. and man, it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn ' t who he was at all, no way, it was an entire act, a perfect and unbreakable cover hiding out a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and saturday morning errands, with all our other boring little lives.
