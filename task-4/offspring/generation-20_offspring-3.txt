See, the whole point of this neighborhood, our little slice of the world, was that it was supposed to be quiet, you know? The biggest drama we ever had was some argument over a hedge or who was supposed to fix the shared fence, that kind of small-town stuff. And the old guy in that yellow house across the street, he was like the mascot for all of it. I swear, he was so unbelievably decent it was almost strange; you just trusted him on sight. He was the kind of guy who'd bring your lawn mower back gassed up and early, and you know he never bought just one box of cookies from the neighborhood kids—he'd take the whole case. But that whole picture shattered one afternoon, a total fluke with the mailman giving me his stuff by mistake. I just opened it on autopilot, man, not even looking, and let me tell you, it wasn't a water bill or a birthday card from his grandkids. No way. Not even in the same ballpark. What I was holding was this heavy government folder, the kind you see in spy movies, all crisscrossed with thick black marker and red stamps. And inside, staring back at me from a photo that had to be twenty years old, was his face—only younger, and his eyes had this look in them, man, this cold, hard, empty look that I'd never seen on the guy I thought I knew. And it all clicked right there in my kitchen, holding that file. His entire friendly, mild-mannered neighbor act wasn't him, not really—it was a performance, a cover for a whole secret life. And whatever that life was, whatever he'd done, it had absolutely no business being on our quiet street of block parties and borrowed tools, you know what I mean?
