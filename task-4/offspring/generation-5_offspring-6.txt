I guess you used to get a deep sense of safety in the quiet sameness of our little street, it was like a safe bubble where the most dramatic thing involved fights over property lines or a guy's messy front lawn. So, and the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for this whole quiet, normal life, you know what I mean? he was just so harmless and quiet, a totally regular dude, you know, he'd borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it. Yeah, but that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by mistake. And listen, it wasn't some friendly bill or a birthday card from his old mom or something, this was a thick, official-looking government thing, its pages just covered in a mess of redacted black lines. And like, right in there, staring out from a photo years old, it was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a totally cold, empty look that wasn't the man next door. Dude, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered nature wasn't who he was at all. no way. it was an act, just a whole built-up front for something so foreign to our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands.
