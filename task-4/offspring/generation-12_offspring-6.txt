you know, it was nice to get a little bit of peace in our little corner of the world, you know what I mean? Like, the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over a fence or some stupid pothole. And that old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for the whole place, just so nice and normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away. You just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it. Then that whole thing was blown up one afternoon when, in a dumb little mix-up with the postman, I got his mail and went and opened it, not even thinking twice about it. But let me tell you, man oh man, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even close. It was this big thick stack of government looking stuff, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real top secret spy movie stuff, you know? And right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all like him now. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, man, not even a little bit. It was a cover up, right? A perfect and unbreakable disguise for a whole other secret life, a life that had no place in our world of potlucks and sleepy homeowners meetings or any of that regular, boring life stuff we all did around here, you know what I mean.
