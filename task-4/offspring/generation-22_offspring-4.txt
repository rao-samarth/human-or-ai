You know, this whole neighborhood was supposed to be about a little bit of peace and quiet in our little corner of the world, where the biggest deal was a squabble over a fence or some stupid property line, you know what I mean? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for it all, I swear to god, man, so nice and normal it was almost weird, the kind of guy you were just sure of right off the bat. Like, you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawnmower and bring it back early, running better than it did before, and he always bought a whole case of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids, too. But that was all put to rest one afternoon in a big fat mix-up with the postman when I got his mail by mistake, opening it on total autopilot without even thinking twice. And lemme tell you, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, oh no, man, not even close, no way. Instead, it was this thick, heavy, government-looking file thing, all crisscrossed with a mess of red stamps and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real spy movie stuff. And right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all like him. It all just clicked for me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't who he was at all, man; it was a big old cover-up for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it damn sure had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in this sleepy little town of ours, not one bit.
