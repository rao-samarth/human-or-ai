See, this whole neighborhood was built on the idea of peace and quiet, you know? The biggest drama we were ever supposed to have was, like, a squabble over a property line or a misplaced fence. That was the whole point. The old man in the yellow house, he was the living, breathing symbol of it. I swear, he was so unbelievably nice it bordered on strange, man. You just knew, deep down, that this was the guy who’d return your lawnmower cleaner than he got it, and he never just bought one box of Girl Scout cookies—he’d take the whole case every time. That whole image shattered, though, thanks to a mix-up with the mail. I got his letter by mistake and, just on autopilot, you know, not even looking, I tore it open. And believe me, it wasn't a phone bill or a birthday card from the grandkids—not even close. What fell out was this heavy, official-looking government file, all slashed up with red redactions and thick black marker, like something straight out of a spy thriller. Tucked inside was a photo, maybe twenty years old, and it was his face, but younger. And his eyes... man, they were cold, hard, and dead—a look I'd never seen on the guy across the street. Holding that file, it all clicked into place. The whole friendly neighbor routine, the mild-mannered act, it was all just a cover, a carefully built facade for a secret life that had absolutely no business being in our sleepy little world of bake sales and weekend barbecues, you know what I mean?
