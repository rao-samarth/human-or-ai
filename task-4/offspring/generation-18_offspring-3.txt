you know, our little neck of the woods was supposed to be about some quiet and boring stuff, and that quietness was the whole point of it all, where the biggest deal was people fighting over a dumb fence or a messy lawn or something, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for it all, i guess, but i swear to god, man, he was so nice and normal it was almost weird, i mean, you were just so sure of the guy right away. it's like you just knew he was the type who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you right away, in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought a whole case of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids, too. but that was all put to rest that day in a big dumb mix-up with the postman when i got his mail and opened it by total accident, on autopilot, not even really looking. and let me tell you, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids or something like that, not at all, no, it was not even close, no way. it was this big, fat, government file thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real secret agent stuff. and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, just so much younger, but his eyes holding this crazy, cold, dead, hard look i'd never seen before, not at all like him. it all kind of clicked right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't who he was at all, not really. it was a big old cover-up for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, man, it just had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in our safe little corner of the universe, you know?
