you know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in our little corner of the world and a little bit of quiet where the biggest deal was people fighting over property lines or something like that. So and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for the whole place. I i don't know but i have to say, he was just so nice and normal and quiet it was almost boring. you were just so sure of him or i was, it ' s like you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than you gave him, and he got a case of those Girl Scout cookies every year from the kids, too. Well that was all put to rest that day in a silly little mail mix up when I got his mail and opened it without even thinking it was auto pilot I guess yeah. let me tell you what, it wasn ' t a gas bill or a birthday card from his mom or anything like that at all, no sir, not even close, no it was some crazy government looking file or a folder all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, right, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary cold, hard look i ' d never seen before, not at all. Man and and so then and all it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his nice - guy act wasn't who or what he was in any way shape or form. it was a big old act, a whole other secret life that sure as heck had no place in our little world of potlucks and block parties in our sleepy little town. you know what I mean right?
