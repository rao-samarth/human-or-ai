It was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the quiet, day-to-day vibe of our little town, you know what I mean? It was just this quiet place where the biggest drama involved fighting over fence lines or a messy front lawn. Yeah, and the old guy in the yellow house was the poster child for the whole place, right across the street there, he was just so darn nice and quiet it was almost weird, that you were just sure of him. You knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you quicker and in better shape than when he got it from you. But that whole picture was pulverized that afternoon when a simple mail screw-up meant I got his mail and opened it by total mistake. Let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his aunt or anything like that, not even close. No way, this was a big old government file all marked up with a criss-cross mess of thick, redacted black lines, for real. And right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a dead cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not once. Man, it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all. Not even close. It was an entire, perfectly built cover story for a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands and all that kind of stuff.
