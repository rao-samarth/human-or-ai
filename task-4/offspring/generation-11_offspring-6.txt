It was easy to get a deep sense of peace in the day-to-day life of our little town, you know what I mean? The craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over property lines, and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place. He was just so nice and normal and quiet, so much it was almost weird, that you were sure of him right away; the kind of guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape. But that was all put to rest that day in a silly little mail mix-up when I got his letter and opened it by mistake, man, and let me tell you, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even close. This was some crazy government file thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real top-secret stuff. Staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his mild-mannered stuff wasn't who he was at all, man, not even a little bit. It was an act, a cover story—a whole other secret life hiding a past that had no place in our world of potlucks and sleepy homeowners, or any of that other regular, boring life stuff, you know?
