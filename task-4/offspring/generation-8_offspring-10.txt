it was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the boring, day - to - day life of our little town, you know what I mean like it was just this quiet place where the only trouble involved fighting over fence lines or a messy front lawn yeah and the old guy in the yellow house was the poster child for the whole place, right across the street there, he was just so darn nice and quiet so normal it was boring, that you were sure of him and you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you quicker and in better shape than when he got it from you I swear but that whole picture was pulverized that afternoon when a simple mail screw - up and i got his mail and opened it by total mistake you know let me tell you, it wasn ' t some gas bill or a card from his aunt or anything like that not even close no way this was a big old government file or something all blacked out with a criss - cross of redacted black lines, for real, and, right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a dead cold, hard look i ' d never seen before not once man, it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild - mannered act wasn ' t who he was at all. not even close, man. it was an entire, perfectly built cover story a total cover for a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and saturday morning errands and all that kind of stuff
