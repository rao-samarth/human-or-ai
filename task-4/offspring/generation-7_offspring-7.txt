You know, it was easy to get a deep sense of peace in the day-to-day predictability of this place, I mean, it was just this quiet little corner of the world where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone’s messy front yard. And that old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for the whole place, you know what I mean? He was so darn friendly and, well, simple, that you just knew he was the kind of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back to you better than he got it. But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal mix-up put his mail in my hands, and I'm telling you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom or junk like that. Heck no, this was a big ol' government-issue folder thing, all covered up in a criss-cross of those redacted black lines, and sure enough, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not ever. And it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, not even close. It was an entire act, a whole built-up front for a past so foreign to our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands that it just didn't make sense.
