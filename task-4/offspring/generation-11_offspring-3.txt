you know, it was nice to get a little bit of peace and quiet in your life and you know what i mean, like this was just a place where the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over a fence or whose dog pooped where or something like that, yeah. and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was like the poster boy for the whole place, you know, just so nice and normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away you know, you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it until one all of a sudden i got his mail by mistake and in a dumb little mail mix - up with the postman i went and opened it, not even thinking twice about it. let me tell you man, it wasn ' t some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even close at all man. this thing was like some kind of secret government file, all blacked up with a criss - cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real top secret spy movie stuff. and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so was his face and man it was but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look i ' d never seen before, not at all like him now. it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild - mannered act wasn ' t who he was at all, man, not even a little bit. it was a cover up yeah you know like a perfect and unbreakable mask for a whole other secret life, a past that had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties and saturday morning errands, or any of that regular, boring life stuff, you know what i'm saying?
