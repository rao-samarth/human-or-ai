You know, this whole neighborhood was supposed to be about a little peace and quiet in our little corner of the world, where the biggest deal was a squabble over a fence or some stupid property line, you know what I mean? And the old guy in the yellow house was the poster child for it all, I swear to god, man, so nice and normal it was almost weird, the kind of guy you were just sure of right off the bat. He was the sort who'd borrow a lawnmower and bring it back early, running better than it did before, and he always bought a whole case of Girl Scout cookies from the kids, too. But that was all put to rest one day when the postman made a big fat mix-up and I got his mail, opening it on total autopilot without even thinking twice. And let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even close, no way. It was this thick, heavy government file thing, crisscrossed with a mess of red stamps and thick, sharpied black lines, like real spy movie type stuff. And right there, staring out from a photo maybe twenty years old, was his face, only so much younger, with this scary, cold, dead, hard look in his eyes I’d never seen before. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered, friendly nice-guy act wasn't who he was at all, man; it was a big old cover for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it sure damn had no place in our world of block parties and potlucks in this sleepy little town, you know?
