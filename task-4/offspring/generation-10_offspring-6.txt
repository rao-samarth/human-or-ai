You know, it was easy to get a real sense of peace in the day-to-day life of our quiet little neighborhood, you know what I mean? Like, the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over property lines or a messy front yard or something like that. And the old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for the whole place, right, he was just so nice and normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away. You just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it and all that stuff. But that whole picture was pulverized that afternoon in a dumb little mail mix-up when I got his letter and opened it by total accident, man, and let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his grandma or anything like that, not in a million years. This thing was like a secret government file, all blacked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, inked black lines, like for real spy movie stuff. And right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old or so was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, and it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, man, not even a little bit. It was just a cover, you know, a perfect and unbreakable costume for hiding a past that had no place in this world of potlucks and sleepy homeowners or any of that other regular stuff.
