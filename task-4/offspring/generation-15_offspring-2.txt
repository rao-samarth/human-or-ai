you know, you were supposed to get a little bit of peace and quiet in our little corner of the suburbs, where the worst of the worst, like, the biggest deal was people fighting over a fence line or a messy lawn or something dumb like that, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for it all, i guess, but i swear to god, man, he was just so nice and normal it was almost weird, that you were just so sure of him right away. i mean, it ' s like you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought a whole case of those girl scout cookies from the kids down the street. but that was all put to rest that day in a big fat mix - up with the postman when i got his mail and opened it by total mistake, just ripping it open, not even thinking about it at all. let me tell you what, it wasn ' t some gas bill or a card from his grandkids or anything like that, not at all, no, it was not even close, no way. it was this big, thick government thing, all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real top secret stuff. and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this weird, cold, dead, hard look i ' d never seen before, not at all like him. it just sort of hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old envelope, that his whole mild - mannered, nice - guy act wasn ' t who he was at all, man, not in any kind of way. that it was a big old cover - up, a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it just had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in this quiet little town, you know what i mean?
