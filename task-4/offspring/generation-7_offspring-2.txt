You know, it's easy to get a real sense of peace in the whole predictability of our quiet little corner of the world. I mean, you just sort of felt like we were in this safe little old place where the only drama involved arguing over property lines or someone's messy front yard. And that old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for the whole place, you know what I mean? He was just so darn friendly, so plain and simple, that you were sure of him; you just knew he was the kind of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back to you quicker and in better shape than when he got it. But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by mistake. Heck, no, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his old aunt; this was a thick, serious-looking government folder all covered in a criss-cross of those redacted black lines. And sure enough, right in there, staring out from a photo maybe twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, empty look I'd never seen before, not ever. And man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, not even close. It was an entire, perfectly built front, a cover for a past so foreign to our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands that it just didn't make sense.
