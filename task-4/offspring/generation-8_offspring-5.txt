It was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the day to day hum of our little town, you know what I mean? It was just this quiet, boring old place where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard. And the old guy in the yellow house was sort of the poster boy for the whole place, right? I mean, he was just so darn nice, so unbelievably polite, that you were sure of him; you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it, you know? But that whole picture was pulverized that afternoon in a simple mail mix-up when I got his mail and opened it by total accident. And let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his niece or anything like that, uh uh no. This was a big thick government-issue file all marked up with a criss-cross of redacted black lines, for real, and right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary cold, hard look I'd never seen before, at all. And man, it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all. Not even close. It was an entire act, a perfect cover for hiding a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and saturday morning errands and all of that kinda stuff.
