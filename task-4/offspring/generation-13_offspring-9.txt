You know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in our little corner of the world, where the craziest thing that ever happened was people arguing over a fence or some stupid property line? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, i swear to god, man, just so nice and normal it was almost boring. You just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than you gave it, and he always bought a bunch of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids too. But that whole thing was put to rest that day in a big fat mix-up when I got his mail by total accident and opened it on autopilot, not even thinking twice about it. And man oh man, let me tell you, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even close at all. This thing was one of those thick government file folders, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and sharpied black lines, like for real top secret spy movie stuff. And staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all like him. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole nice-guy, mild-mannered act wasn't who he was in any sort of way at all. It was a cover-up, a big old disguise for a whole other secret life that had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in our sleepy little town, you know?
