You know, this whole neighborhood was supposed to be our quiet corner of the world, where the biggest drama was some fight over a property line—that was the point of it all, you know what I mean? And the old guy in the yellow house, he was the poster boy for that peace, so nice and normal it was almost weird. I swear, you just knew he was the type to borrow a lawnmower and bring it back early, in better shape than he got it, and he always bought a whole case of cookies from the Girl Scouts. But that picture shattered one afternoon thanks to a big mix-up with the postman; I got his mail and opened it on total autopilot, just a dumb accident. Let me tell you, it was no phone bill or card from the grandkids, not even close. It was this thick, heavy government file, all marked up with a criss-cross of red and heavy black marker, like something straight out of a spy movie. And right there, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his much younger face, but his eyes held this cold, dead, scary hardness that was nothing like the man I knew. It all just hit me then, holding that file, that his entire mild-mannered act wasn't him at all—it was a cover-up, man, a whole secret life that had no damn place in our world of potlucks and sleepy block parties.
