You kinda started to get a real sense of peace in the day to day of this quiet little corner of our world, you know, 'cause man, we were in this really quiet old place where the most exciting thing involved arguing over property lines or someone's messy front yard. And that old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for this whole place; I mean, he was just so darn neighborly and, well, plain and simple, that you just knew he was the kind of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it, right? But that whole picture was pulverized the day a dumb postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by accident. And I'm telling you, it wasn't a phone bill or a birthday card from his old mom or whatever. No, man, no, this was a big, serious-looking government file covered in a whole bunch of those redacted black lines. And, right in there, staring out from a picture maybe twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this weird cold and empty look I'd never seen before, not ever. And man, it hit me right then and there that his whole mild-mannered vibe wasn't who he was at all, not even close. It was an act, a whole built-up front, you know what I mean? A cover for a life so foreign to our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands that it just didn't fit.
