It was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the predictable, day-to-day hum of our little world, you know what I mean? I figured it was just this quiet, kinda boring old place where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something like that. And the old guy in the yellow house was sort of the poster child for the whole place, right? I mean, he was just so darn nice, so unbelievably polite and normal, that you were sure of him; you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you quicker and in better shape than when he got it. But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up meant I got his mail and opened it by total accident, and let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his niece or anything like that, uh uh no. This was a big ol' government-issue folder thing all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines, for real, and, right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look I'd never seen before, at all. And man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was, like not even close. It was an entire, perfectly built front, a cover for a past that had no place in our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands and all of that kinda stuff.
