You know, it was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the quiet predictability of our little neighborhood, a cozy little world where the biggest drama was usually someone arguing over a fence line or whose dog pooped where it shouldn't, and the old guy in the yellow bungalow was kind of the poster child for this niceness. I mean, he was just so gosh darn nice, a quiet neighbor so ridiculously good you just knew he'd borrow a garden tool and return it cleaner than he got it and stuff like that, you know? But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up landed his mail in my box by total accident. I opened it, and it wasn't some friendly bill or a birthday card from his aunt Sue or something, this was a thick, official-looking government file folder, all covered in a criss-cross of redacted black lines. And staring right out from a photo decades old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look I'd never seen before. And yeah, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy envelope, that his mild-mannered nature wasn't who he was at all. Not even close, no way. It was just a show, an act and a carefully built front for a past so foreign to our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands it just didn't compute.
