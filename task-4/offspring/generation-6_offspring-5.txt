It was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the whole predictability of the place, you know what I mean, this quiet, old place where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something. And the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for the whole thing. I mean, he was just so unbelievably nice, so decent and normal, that you just knew he'd be the guy to, like, borrow a garden tool and get it back quicker than he got it from you, you know? But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up meant I got his mail by mistake. It wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom or anything like that; no, this was a big ol' government-issue folder thing all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines everywhere. And right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look I'd never seen before, at all. Man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was. Not even close. It was an entire act, a perfectly built front for a past that had no place in our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands and junk like that.
