You know, I always got a good feeling of safety in the quiet predictability of our little street, a peaceful bubble where the biggest deal involved fights over property lines or whose dog pooped on someone's lawn. The guy in the yellow house was basically the poster child for this whole thing. I mean, he was just so, I don't know, normal, a quiet neighbor so reliable, you know, the kinda guy that he'd borrow a hammer and return it cleaner than he got it. Yeah, but that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by mistake. So, it wasn't some monthly bill or a card from his old aunt or something, this was a thick, official-looking government file thing, its pages covered in a whole mess of redacted black lines. and staring right out from a photo decades old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a creepy cold, hard look I'd never seen before, ever. And man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered nature wasn't who he was at all, not even close. it was just an act, a carefully built wall for a past that just didn't belong to our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands.
