you know, the whole point of this place was this little pocket of quiet life, where the biggest deal was some dumb little fight over a fence or a messy front lawn, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for all of it, honest to god, man, so unbelievably decent and normal it was almost kinda weird, the kind of guy you just trusted on sight. he was the guy who'd borrow your lawn mower and bring it back gassed up and in better shape than when he got it, and he never just bought one box of cookies from the girl scouts who came around, he'd take the whole case. but that whole picture fell apart one afternoon in a big fat mix-up with the mailman when I got his stuff by mistake and just opened it on autopilot, not even really looking. and let me tell you, it wasn't a water bill or a card from his grandkids, no way, not even in the same ballpark, man. what I was holding was this crazy, thick government file, the kind you see in the movies, all crisscrossed with a mess of thick, sharpied black lines and red stamps, like for real spy movie stuff, okay? and inside, staring back at me from a photo that had to be twenty years old, was his face, only so much younger, and his eyes had this scary, empty, cold, hard, dead look in them, a look I'd never seen on the guy I thought I knew, ever. it all just clicked for me then, standing there holding that thing, that his whole friendly, mild-mannered neighbor act wasn't him at all, you know? it was a mask, a big old cover-up for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, whatever he'd done, it sure as hell had no place in our world of block parties and backyard potlucks in this sleepy little town of ours.
