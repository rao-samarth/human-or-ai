You know, the whole point of this place, this little bubble of suburbia, was that it was supposed to be safe, like, totally and completely boring, where the biggest drama was some fight over a fence or a stupid property line, you know what I mean? And the old guy in that yellow house across the street, I swear to god, man, he was the poster boy for it all, so unbelievably decent it was almost weird. You just trusted him on sight, 'cause he was the kind of guy who'd bring your lawn mower back gassed up for you, and he never bought just one box of cookies from the girl scouts, nope, he'd take the whole case. But that whole picture was put to rest one afternoon, a simple fluke with the postman giving me his stuff by mistake. I just kind of opened it on autopilot, not even thinking, and let me tell you, it wasn't a water bill or a birthday card from his grandkids, not even in the same ballpark, man. What I was holding was this crazy government file, the kind you see in the movies, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red stamps and thick, sharpied black lines. And inside, staring back at me from a photo that had to be twenty years old, was his face, only younger, and his eyes had this cold, hard, dead look that I'd never seen on the guy I thought I knew. It all just hit me right then and there, standing on my porch holding that thing, that his whole friendly, mild-mannered neighbor act wasn't him, not really; it was a mask, a big old cover-up for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it sure damn had no place in our quiet world of block parties and borrowed tools, you know?
