You know, the whole point of this neighborhood was supposed to be its quiet, boring peace, where the biggest drama was some fight over a property line, that sort of thing. And the old guy in the yellow house was the poster child for it all; I swear, he was so unbelievably nice and normal it was almost strange, the kind of guy you just trusted on sight. You just knew he was the type to borrow your lawn mower and bring it back a day early, gassed up and cleaner than before, and he’d always buy a whole case of cookies from the Girl Scouts. But that whole image shattered one afternoon, a big dumb mix-up with the mailman, and I got his mail and just opened it on autopilot, not even thinking. And believe me, it wasn’t some utility bill or a birthday card from his grandkids, not even close. It was this thick, official-looking government file, a total mess of crisscrossing red ink and heavy black marker, real spy movie stuff. And right there, staring back from a photo that was at least twenty years old, was his face, only younger, with these cold, hard, dead eyes I'd never seen before. It just hit me then, holding that thing, that his whole mild-mannered, good-neighbor act was a complete fabrication, man, a cover for some other secret life that had absolutely no place in our little world of block parties and potlucks, you know?
