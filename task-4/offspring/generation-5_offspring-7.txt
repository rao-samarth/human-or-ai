It was easy to get a deep sense of comfort in the boring predictability of our little neighborhood, you know, it was just a quiet, old place where the only drama involved fights over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something, and the old guy in the yellow house was sort of the poster child for the whole place. I mean, he was just that guy, like, he was so unbelievably nice, you were sure of him, that you just knew he'd borrow a garden tool and get it back cleaner than he got it from you and stuff, but that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by mistake. Anyway, it wasn't some friendly bill or a card from his grandma or whatever, this was a thick, official-looking government file that was all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines. and, right in there, staring out from a photo decades old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look I'd never seen before, at all, and, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered nature wasn't who he was at all. not even close. it was an act, a carefully built front for a past totally alien to our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands and junk like that.
