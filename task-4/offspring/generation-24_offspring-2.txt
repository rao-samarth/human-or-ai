you know, the whole point of this place was this little pocket of peace and quiet in our little corner of the world. i mean, that was the whole point of it all, that it was supposed to be safe and completely boring, where the biggest drama was a squabble over a fence or some stupid property line thing, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for it all, i swear to god, man, he was so unbelievably decent it was almost weird, like it wasn't even real, you just trusted him on sight. he was the kind of guy who ' d borrow your lawn mower and bring it back early, gas filled up and in better shape than when he got it. and he always bought a whole case of those girl scout cookies from the kids, too. but that whole picture was put to rest real quick in a dumb little mix - up with the postman when i got his mail by total accident, opening it on autopilot without even thinking twice. and let me tell you, it wasn ' t some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no way, man, not at all, not even close, not on your life. it was this big, thick, official - looking government thing, all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red stamps and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real top secret kinda stuff. and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, it was his face, only so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, hard, dead look i ' d never seen on the guy i thought i knew, ever. it all just sorta hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild - mannered, nice - guy act wasn ' t who he was at all, man ; it was a mask, a big old cover - up for a whole other secret life or something, and whatever that life was, it sure as hell had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in this quiet little town of ours, you can bet on that.
