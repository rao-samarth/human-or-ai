You kinda started to get a deep sense of peace in the whole predictability of this little town here, you know, because we were in this really quiet, old place where the only drama involved arguing over property lines or someone's messy front yard. And that old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for it all, I mean, he was just so darn neighborly, so unbelievably nice, you just knew he was the kind of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it, right? But that whole picture was pulverized the day a dumb postal screw-up put his mail in my hands, and I'm telling you, it wasn't some gas bill or a birthday card from his mom or whatever. No, man, no, this was a big ol' government-issue folder thing, all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines. And right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scarily cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not ever. It hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered vibe wasn't who he was at all, not even close. It was a perfectly built front, you know what I mean? A cover for a life so foreign to our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands and junk like that, a past that just didn't fit in here.
