you know, the whole point of this little corner of the world was a bit of peace and quiet. I mean, things were so dull the deal was that the big news was some fight over a hedge or a stupid property line, if you know what i mean? and the old guy in that yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole thing. I mean, he was just so normal and nice it was almost boring. it's like you knew, right off the bat, that he was the kind of guy who'd return your lawnmower early and in better shape than he got it, and he always bought a whole case of girl scout cookies from the local kids, too. Yeah, but all that got tossed out the window that day, thanks to a big mix-up with the postman. I just got his mail by mistake and just opened it on autopilot, not even thinking. and let me tell you, it was not some gas bill or a birthday card from his grandkids. Nope, no, way, man, not even close. No, it was this big old heavy government file, the kind you see in the movies, all criss-crossed with red marked lines in red and thick black marker all over. and inside, staring out from a photo that had to be twenty years old, it was his face — only younger, and his eyes had this scary, cold, dead look I'd never seen before. it hit me right then, standing there holding that thing, that his whole quiet, mild-mannered neighbor act was just that — an act. it was a cover for some other, secret life, and whatever that life was, man, it had no damn place in our nice little world of potlucks and block parties and all that stuff.
