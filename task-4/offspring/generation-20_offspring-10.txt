See, this whole neighborhood was supposed to be our quiet little spot, you know? The entire point was that the biggest drama we ever had was some dumb argument over a property line, and the old fella in the yellow house was the perfect picture of that, I swear. He was so normal it was almost strange, man, like you just knew instinctively he was the kind of guy who'd return your lawnmower gassed up and early and always buy a whole case of Girl Scout cookies. But that whole image just shattered one afternoon, a complete fluke with the mailman. I got his mail by mistake and, just on autopilot, I tore it open without a second thought. And let me tell you, it wasn't a utility bill, no sir, not even close. It was this heavy, official-looking government file, all blacked out with thick marker and criss-crossed with red lines like something straight out of a spy thriller. And right there, staring back from an old photo, was his face, maybe twenty years younger, but his eyes were cold, hard, and totally dead inside—nothing like the guy I knew. Holding that file, it all just clicked, you know? His whole friendly, mild-mannered act wasn't him at all; it was a big old cover for a secret life that had absolutely no business being on our sleepy street of potlucks and bake sales.
