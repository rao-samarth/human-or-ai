It was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the whole predictability of our little world, you know what i mean, it was just this quiet, old place where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something. And the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for the whole place. i mean, he was just so darn nice, so unbelievably polite, that you were sure of him; you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back to you quicker and in better shape than when he got it, you know? But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up meant i got his mail and opened it by total mistake. It wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom or anything like that; no, this was a big ol' government-issue folder thing all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines everywhere, and, right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look i'd never seen before, at all. And man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all. Not even close. It was an entire act, a perfectly built front for a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and saturday morning errands and junk like that.
