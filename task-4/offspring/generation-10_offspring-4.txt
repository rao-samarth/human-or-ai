you know, it always felt like it was a place where you could get a real sense of peace in your life, a little bit of quiet, where the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over property lines or something silly. and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, I mean, really, you thought he was just so nice and normal and quiet, so much so it was almost boring, that you were sure of him. you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape, and that he bought a ton of those Girl Scout cookies every single year. But yeah, that whole idea was put to rest that day in a stupid little mail mix-up when I got his mail and opened it by mistake, you know, thinking it was for me. And you know, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom, no way, not even close, not in a million years. It was some kind of government file or something all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red and thick blacked - out lines, like for real secret agent kinda stuff, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, so much younger, his eyes holding a hard, cold, dead look I'd never seen before. and it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild - mannered act wasn ' t who he was at all, no way. like, it was a show, a perfect and totally unbreakable cover for a past that had no place in our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands or something.
