It was easy to get a deep sense of calm in our little neighborhood, a place where you were supposed to get a bit of peace and quiet, and the biggest drama was people fighting over property lines or parking spaces, you know what I mean? The old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, I guess. He was just so nice and normal it was almost boring, so much so that you were sure of him; like, you just knew he was the guy who’d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape, and you knew for a fact he got a ton of those Girl Scout cookies every single year. But that whole picture was pulverized that day in a stupid little mail mix-up when I got his letter and opened it by mistake. And man, let me tell you, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his niece, no sir, not even close. This was some kind of big old government file, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick blacked-out lines, like for real, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, him, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary cold, hard look I'd never seen before. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all; it was a show, a total and completely unbreakable costume with a history that had no place in our world of potlucks, block parties, and Saturday morning errands.
