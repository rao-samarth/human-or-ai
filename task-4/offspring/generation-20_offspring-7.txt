This neighborhood, man, it was supposed to be our slice of tranquility, you know? That was the whole idea, a place where the biggest drama was some squabble over a hedge or a poorly placed fence. And the old fella over in that yellow house, he was the picture of it, so perfectly normal it was almost unsettling, I swear. He was the kind of guy you'd trust with your lawnmower, knowing it'd come back better than you gave it, and he'd buy out the entire supply of Thin Mints from the neighborhood kids. But that whole image shattered because of a simple mail screw-up. I got his envelope, and on pure autopilot, just ripped it open without a second thought. And man, it wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, not even close. What I was holding was this heavy, official-looking government file, slashed all over with red ink and thick black marker, straight out of some spy thriller. Tucked inside, a photo from maybe twenty years back showed his face—younger, yeah, but his eyes were cold, hard, and totally dead, a look I’d never seen on the guy who waved from his porch. That's when it all clicked, holding that file. The whole friendly-neighbor thing wasn't him at all; it was a deep cover for a whole other life, and whatever that life was, it had no damn business being on our quiet street of bake sales and weekend barbecues, you know what I mean?
