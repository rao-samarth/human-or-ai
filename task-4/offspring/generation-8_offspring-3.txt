It was easy to get a deep sense of calm in the day in to day life of our little town, you know what i mean? I mean, it was just this quiet, old place where the biggest drama was people fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something like that. Really. and the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for the whole place, you know? I mean, he was just so darn nice, so unbelievably normal, that you were sure of him. Yeah. you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it, you know? For real. but that whole idea was pulverized the day a simple mailman screw-up when i got his mail and opened it by total accident. Ugh. And let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his sister or anything like that. No. Way. Man. no, this was a big old secret government-type thing, all covered up in a criss cross of redacted black lines, for crying out loud. and, right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary cold, hard look i'd never seen before, at all. I swear. man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was. not even close. Wow. it was an entire, perfectly built front for God knows what else, stuff that had no place in our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands and all that other boring stuff.
