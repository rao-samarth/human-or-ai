You know, it was easy to get a deep sense of peace in the day-to-day life of this little neighborhood, you know what I mean, like, the craziest thing that ever happened around here was people fighting over fence lines or a messy front yard or something like that. and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was like the poster boy for the whole place, you know, he was just so nice and normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away. you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it and all that kind of stuff. that whole thing was just crushed one afternoon in a dumb little mail mix-up when I got his letter and opened it by accident, not even thinking about it, and let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his grandkids or anything like that, no, not even close. this thing was like some kind of wild government file all blacked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real secret agent stuff. and right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old or so was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all like him. it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, man, not even a little bit. it was just a total disguise, you know, like a perfect and unbreakable cover for hiding a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and sleepy homeowners, or any of that other regular, boring life stuff, you know?
