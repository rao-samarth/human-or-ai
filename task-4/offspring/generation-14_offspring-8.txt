you know, you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in our little corner of the world, i mean that kind of was the point of the whole place, you know, where the biggest deal was people arguing over property lines or something like that, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for it all, i mean, he was just so nice and normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away. i mean, you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than you gave it, and he got a whole case of those girl scout cookies every year from the kids, too. but yeah that whole thing was put to rest that day in a big old stupid mix up when i got his mail and opened it by total accident, just autopilot, not even thinking. and let me tell you it wasn ' t some gas bill or a card from his auntie or anything like that not even close, no way, it was this really thick manila folder thing, all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real, the official government kind, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, cold, dead, hard look i ' d never seen before, not at all like him. and it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild - mannered, nice - guy act wasn ' t who he was at all, you know? it was a big old act, a cover - up, a whole other secret life that sure as hell had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties and all that other boring, normal life stuff we all did around here, you know what i'm saying?
