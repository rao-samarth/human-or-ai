You know, the whole point of this place, this little bubble, was that it was supposed to be about a little peace and quiet, like, totally and completely boring, you know what I mean? And the old guy in that yellow house across the street, he was the poster boy for all of it. I swear to god, man, he was so unbelievably decent it was almost weird, the kind of guy you just trusted on sight. You just knew he'd bring your lawn mower back gassed up for you, and he never bought just one box of cookies from the girl scouts, nope, he'd take the whole case. But that whole picture fell apart one afternoon, a big fat mix-up with the postman giving me his stuff by mistake. I just kind of opened it on autopilot, not even thinking twice. And let me tell you, it wasn't a water bill or a birthday card from his grandkids, no sir, not even in the same ballpark. It was this crazy government file, the kind you see in spy movies, all crisscrossed with thick black marker and red stamps. And inside, staring back at me from a photo that had to be twenty years old, was his face, but younger, and his eyes had this cold, hard, dead look in them, man, a look I'd never seen on the guy I thought I knew. It all just hit me right then, standing there holding that thing, that his whole friendly, mild-mannered neighbor act wasn't him, not really; it was a mask, a cover for a whole other secret life. And whatever that life was, it sure damn had no place in our quiet world of block parties and borrowed tools, you know?
