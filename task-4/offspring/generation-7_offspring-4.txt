it was easy to get a deep sense of calm in the nice, quiet, little bubble of our neighborhood, you know? I mean, it was that kind of an old place where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something like that. the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the gold standard for the whole place, I guess, he was just that guy, like, so unbelievably nice and normal that you were sure of him. I mean, you just knew he'd borrow a garden hose and get it back to you fast, and in better shape than when he got it, you know, and all that. but that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple mail mix-up happened. i got his letter and opened it by mistake. it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom or anything like that. No sir, this was a big old official government-issue file thing all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines everywhere, and, right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look i'd never seen before, at all. Like ever. man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all. not even close. It was an entire, fake built front for a past that had no place in our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands and stuff like that. Period.
