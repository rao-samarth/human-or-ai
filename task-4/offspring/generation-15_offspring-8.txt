You know, this place was supposed to be about a little bit of peace and quiet, that sorta was the point of it all, where the biggest deal was people fighting over some stupid property line or something like that, you know what I mean? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for it all, I guess, but I swear to god, man, he was just so nice and normal it was almost weird. You were just so sure of him, I mean, you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought a whole case of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids, too. But that was all put to rest that day in a big fat mix-up with the postman when I got his mail and opened it by total accident, just autopilot, not even thinking twice. And let me tell you what, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not at all, not even close, no way. It was this big thick government file thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real spy movie stuff. And right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all like him. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't who he was at all, man; it was a big old cover-up, a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it sure damn had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in our sleepy little town, you know?
