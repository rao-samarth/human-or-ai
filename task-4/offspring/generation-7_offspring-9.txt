You know, it was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the whole predictability of the place, a quiet little corner of our world where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard, and that old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for it all. He was just so unbelievably, darn friendly, you were sure of him, the kind of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back quicker than he got it from you, and that was that. But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal mix-up put his mail in my hands by accident. I'm telling you, it wasn't some gas bill or a birthday card from his mom or anything like that, heck, no. This was a thick, serious-looking government-issue folder, all covered in a criss-cross of redacted black lines, and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not ever. And it hit me right then and there that his whole mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, not even close. It was a perfectly built front, a cover for a life so foreign to our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands that it just didn't make sense.
