See, the whole point of this neighborhood was supposed to be its quiet, uneventful nature, you know? The biggest drama we ever had was some argument over a hedge. And the old fella over in the yellow house was the perfect example of that—just so dependably normal, it was almost suspicious. He was the kind of guy you knew would return your tools cleaner than he got them and buy a box of cookies from every kid on the block. But that whole illusion shattered the day the mailman screwed up and I got his package by mistake, opening it on pure instinct. And man, let me tell you, it wasn't a bill or something from his family, not even close. It was this heavy, official-looking government file, covered in redacted lines and classified stamps, like something straight out of a thriller. And inside, a photo from maybe twenty years back showed his face, only younger, and with these cold, stone-hard eyes I’d never seen on him—not once. It hit me then, holding that file, that his whole friendly, lawn-mower-lending routine wasn't him at all; it was a front, a carefully built cover for a secret past that had absolutely no business being on our quiet, suburban street of potlucks and petty squabbles.
