I always used to get a deep sense of safety in the day-to-day of our sleepy little neighborhood, you know, this old place where the most crazy thing involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard. And I mean, that old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for this whole place because he was just so darn quiet and so completely, so decent and normal, that you just knew he was the kind of guy who'd, like, borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it the next day. But that whole picture was pulverized the day a dumb postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by total mistake. And I'm telling you, it wasn't some gas bill or a birthday card from his old mom or whatever. Nope, not even close. This was a big, official-looking government file all covered up in a whole bunch of those big redacted black lines and stuff. And right in there, staring out from a photo maybe twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a totally cold look I'd never seen before, not ever. And man, it hit me right then and there that his whole mild-mannered thing wasn't who he was at all, not even close. It was an act, a front, a whole built-up wall for a life so foreign to our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands that it was just totally wrong.
