You know, the whole point of this place, this little bubble of suburbia, was that it was supposed to be about peace and quiet, where the biggest drama was some stupid fight over a fence, you know what I mean? And the old guy in that yellow house, I swear to god, man, he was the poster boy for all of it. He was so unbelievably decent it was almost weird; you just trusted him on sight, the kind of guy who'd bring your lawn mower back gassed up and in better shape, and he never bought just one box of cookies from the girl scouts, nope, he'd take the whole case. But that whole picture fell apart one afternoon, a big fat mix-up with the postman giving me his stuff by mistake. I just opened it on autopilot, not even thinking twice. And let me tell you, it wasn't some water bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even in the same ballpark. It was this crazy government file, the kind of for-real spy movie stuff all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red stamps and thick, sharpied black lines. And inside, staring back at me from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, but younger, and his eyes had this cold, hard, empty look that I'd never seen on the guy I thought I knew. It just hit me then, standing there holding that thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't him, not really. It was a mask, a big old cover-up for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it sure damn had no place in our quiet world of potlucks and borrowed tools, you know?
