You know, this whole place was supposed to be our little corner of peace and quiet, where the biggest drama was a fight over a fence or some stupid property line, that sort of thing. The old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for all of it, I guess. I swear, man, he was so normal it was almost creepy—the kind of guy you just knew would return a borrowed lawn mower gassed up and early, the guy who bought a whole case of cookies from every Girl Scout on the block. But that illusion shattered that day, all thanks to a big fat mix-up with the postman when I got his mail and opened it on autopilot, a total accident. And let me tell you, it wasn't a bill or some card from his grandkids, no sir. Not even close. It was this thick, heavy government file, the kind you see in spy movies, all criss-crossed with these angry red and black marker lines. Staring out from a photo inside, maybe twenty years old, was his face, but younger, and his eyes held this cold, hard, dead look I'd never seen. And right there, holding that weird, heavy thing, it all just clicked. His whole nice-guy, mild-mannered act? It wasn't him, not in any real way. It was a cover, a whole secret life he was hiding, and whatever that life was, it had no damn place in our little world of block parties and potlucks, you know what I mean?
