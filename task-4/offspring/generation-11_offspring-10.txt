You know, you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in this quiet little neighborhood, and that was the whole point, I mean, like it was just this place where the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over property lines or something like that. The old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for the whole place, or at least I thought so; he was just so nice and normal and quiet it was almost weird, but you were sure of him. You just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape, and buy a ton of those Girl Scout cookies every single year. But that whole picture was blown up that afternoon in a dumb little mail mix-up when I got his letter and opened it by mistake, man. And let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his grandma, no sir, not even close, not in a million years. This thing was like a secret government file, for real spy movie stuff, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick blacked-out lines. Staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, him alright but so much younger, his eyes holding this cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, man. It was just a cover, you know, a total and completely unbreakable one for a whole other secret life that had no place in our world of potlucks, block parties, and sleepy homeowners.
