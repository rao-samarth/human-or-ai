It was easy to get a deep sense of calm in the quiet vibe of our little neighborhood, you know what I mean? The biggest drama that ever happened around here was people fighting over parking spaces or fence lines or something like that. And the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for the whole place, right? He was just so freakin' nice, so normal it was almost weird, that you were just sure of him, like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it, you know? But that whole picture was just blown apart that afternoon in a simple mail mix-up when I accidentally grabbed his letter and opened it by total mistake. And let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his niece or anything like that, not even close, man. No, this was some big old government file all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick black lines, like for real. And right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, yeah, but so much younger, his eyes holding a seriously cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all. And boom, it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, man, like not even a little bit. It was just a total act, a kind of perfect cover that was like an unbreakable costume, hiding a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands or any of that other regular stuff.
