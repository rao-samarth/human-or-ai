You know, this whole neighborhood was supposed to be our little pocket of peace and quiet, that was the entire point, really, where the biggest crisis was somebody's fence being a foot over the property line. And the old guy in that yellow house, he was the poster child for it all, I swear, just so unbelievably nice and normal you almost got suspicious. You just knew he was the kind of guy who'd borrow your lawnmower and bring it back cleaner than he got it, and he'd always buy a whole damn case of Girl Scout cookies from the neighborhood kids, you know? But that all just fell apart the day the postman made a mistake and I got his mail, and like an idiot, I opened it on total autopilot without a second thought. And it wasn't some gas bill or a birthday card from the grandkids, no sir, not even in the same universe. It was this thick, heavy government file, all scarred up with a mess of red ink and thick black marker, real spy movie stuff. And right there, staring out from a photo maybe twenty years old, was his face—only younger, and his eyes had this hard, cold, dead look that just wasn't him. And it hit me right then, holding that thing, that his whole friendly, mild-mannered neighbor routine wasn't the real him at all, man; it was a cover-up, a secret life that had no place in our sleepy little world of block parties and bake sales, not a single damn bit.
