you know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace and quiet in our little corner of the world, and that kinda was the point of it all, where the biggest deal was people fighting over a fence or some scraggly old weeds, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for it all, i guess, but i have to say, man, he was just so nice and normal it was almost weird. you were just so sure of him right away, you know, it's like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and he would always buy a whole case of those girl scout cookies from the kids, too, right? but that was all put to rest one day in a big old mix-up with the postman when i got his mail and opened it by total accident, just on autopilot, not even thinking twice about it, and let me tell you what, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, oh no, not at all, no, it was not even close, not in the slightest. it was this big, thick, official-looking thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real top secret kinda stuff. and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this blank, cold, dead, hard look i'd never seen before, not at all like him, ever. it all just sorta clicked right then and there, holding that heavy old thing in my hands. his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't who he was at all, man, not for one single second of it. it was a big old cover-up, a whole other secret life, yeah, and whatever that life was, it just had absolutely no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in this boring little town of ours, not at all.
