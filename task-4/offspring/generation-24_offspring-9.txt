You know, the whole point of this place was this little pocket of peace and quiet in our corner of the world, that it was supposed to be safe and completely boring, where the biggest deal was some dumb little fight over a fence or a stupid property line, you know what I mean? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for it all, I swear to god, man, he was so unbelievably decent it was almost kinda weird; you just trusted him on sight. He was the kind of guy who'd borrow your lawnmower and bring it back early, gassed up and in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought a whole case of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids, too. But that whole picture was put to rest that day in a big fat mix-up with the postman when I got his mail by total accident, opening it on autopilot without even thinking twice. And lemme tell you, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not at all, not even close, no way. What I was holding was this big, thick, crazy government file, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red stamps and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real spy movie stuff, okay? And right in there, staring back at me from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, only so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, hard, dead look I'd never seen on the guy I thought I knew, ever. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't who he was at all, man; it was a mask, a big old cover-up for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it sure as hell had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in our sleepy little town, you know?
