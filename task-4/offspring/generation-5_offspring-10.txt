You know, you start to get a deep sense of calm in the quiet predictability of this little town, like a safe little bubble where the most crazy thing was a fight over a property line or some neighbor's messy lawn. I thought the man in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for this whole quiet, normal life, you know? I mean, he was just so good, you know, the kind of guy who'd buy a ton of Girl Scout cookies. He'd borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it, but that whole illusion was shattered the day a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by mistake. Well, it wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card from his old aunt or something, no, this was a thick, official-looking government file, its pages covered in a total mess of redacted black lines, and right in there, staring out from a photo years old, was his face, clear as day but so much younger, his eyes holding a really cold, kinda empty look that just wasn't the man next door. And it hit me right then and there that his quiet, mild-mannered nature wasn't who he was at all — it was an act, like a whole front built up to cover a life so foreign to our world of potlucks and PTA meetings, you know?
