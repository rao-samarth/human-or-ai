you know, this whole place was supposed to be our own little bubble of peace and quiet, where the worst thing was some dumb squabble over a hedge or a messy lawn or whatever, you know what i mean, right? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for it all, i swear to god, man, just so unbelievably decent and normal it was almost weird in itself, the kind of guy you trusted on sight. he was the kind of guy who ' d borrow your lawnmower and bring it back early, gas topped up and in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought like a ton of those girl scout cookies from the neighborhood kids down the street. but that whole picture was put to rest one afternoon in a big fat mix - up with the postman when i got his mail by total accident and just ripped it on autopilot without even thinking twice, you know, like you do. let me tell you, it wasn ' t some phone bill or a card from his old friends, no way, man, not even close, it was like this whole other thing. it was this big, thick, official-looking file, all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red stamps and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real government spy stuff, you know, and right in there, staring back at me from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, only so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, hard, dead look i ' d never seen on the guy i thought i knew, ever. it all clicked into place for me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild - mannered, nice - guy act wasn ' t him at all, not really, it was a mask, a big old cover - up for a whole other secret life or something, and whatever that life was, it sure as hell had no place here between the potlucks and block parties in this quiet little town of ours, you know?
