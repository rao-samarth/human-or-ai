you see, this place was supposed to be about a little bit of peace and quiet in our little corner of the world, and I guess that was kinda the point of it all, where the biggest deal was people fighting over a fence or some dumb uncut grass, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for it all, i guess, but i swear to god, man, he was just so nice and normal it was almost creepy. you were just so sure of him, i mean, it's like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and he would always buy a whole ton of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids, you know the type. well that was all put to rest that afternoon in a dumb little mix-up with the postman when I got his mail and opened it by total mistake, just autopilot, not even paying any real attention. and let me tell you what, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not at all, no, it was not even close, no way. it was this big, thick, official-looking government thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real spy movie prop or something. and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this blank, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all like him. and it just kinda hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy routine wasn't who he was at all, man, not in any real sorta way, nope. it was a big old cover-up, a whole other secret life, you know? and whatever that life was, it sure as hell had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in our sleepy little town, no freakin' way.
