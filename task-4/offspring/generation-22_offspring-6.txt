you know, the whole point of this place was this little pocket of quiet life, supposed to be about peace and quiet, completely boring, where the biggest deal was some dumb little fight over a fence, you know what I mean? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for all of it, I swear to god, man, he was so unbelievably decent it was almost kinda weird, the kind of guy you just trusted on sight. He'd borrow your lawn mower and bring it back gassed up and in better shape than when he got it, and he never just bought one box of cookies from the girl scouts, he’d take the whole case. But that whole picture fell apart one afternoon in a big fat mix-up with the mailman when I got his stuff by mistake and opened it on total autopilot, not even really looking. And let me tell you, it wasn't a water bill or a card from his grandkids, no way, not even in the same ballpark, man. What I was holding was this thick, heavy government file, the kind you see in the movies, all crisscrossed with sharpied black lines and red stamps, like for real spy movie stuff, okay? And inside, staring back at me from a photo that had to be twenty years old, was his face, only so much younger, and his eyes had this empty, cold, hard, dead look in them I’d never seen before. It all just clicked for me right then and there, holding that thing, that his whole friendly, mild-mannered neighbor act wasn't him at all, you know? It was a mask, a big old cover-up for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, whatever he'd done, it sure as hell had no place in our world of block parties and backyard potlucks, not in this sleepy little town of ours, not one bit.
