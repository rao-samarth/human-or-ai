you know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in this little part of the world, you know, a little bit of quiet where the biggest deal was people fighting over property lines or something like that, right? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, i mean, i really thought i knew him, he was just so nice and normal it was almost weird. you were just so sure of him, the kind of guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than you gave it, and he got like a case of those girl scout cookies every year from the kids, you know? but that was all put to rest that day in a stupid little mix - up when the mailman gave me his letter and i opened it by total accident, just on autopilot, you know? tell you what, it wasn ' t a gas bill or a birthday card from his mom or anything like that at all, not even a little bit, not even close, no way. this was some kinda weird government file, all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines everywhere, and staring right out from a picture twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, cold, hard look i ' d never seen before, man. and so then it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his nice - guy, mild - mannered stuff wasn ' t who or what he was in any real kinda way, you know? it was an act, a whole other secret life that sure as heck had no business in our little world of potlucks and block parties in our boring little town where things like that just don't happen.
