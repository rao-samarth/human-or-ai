Okay, so, the whole point of this place was this little bubble of peace and quiet in our corner of the world, that was kinda like the whole point of it all, that it was supposed to be safe and boring, right, where the biggest deal was some dumb little fight over a fence or a property line, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for it all, i swear to god, man, he was so unbelievably plain and simple it was almost kind of weird, i mean, you just trusted him on sight, you know? he was the kind of guy who 'd borrow your lawn mower and bring it back early, gas filled up and in better shape than when he got it, even, and he 'd always buy a ton of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids, too, right? but that whole picture was put to rest that day in a big fat mix - up with the postman, because i got his mail by accident, you see, and just opened it on autopilot, not even thinking about it. and let me tell you what, man, it wasn ' t some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, oh hell no, not at all, not even close, no way, dude. it was this big, thick, government - looking file thing, all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red stamps and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real top secret stuff, okay? and right in there, staring back at me from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, only so much younger, his eyes holding this crazy, cold, hard, dead look i ' d never seen on the guy i thought i knew, ever. it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild - mannered, nice - guy act wasn ' t who he was at all, man, not in any sort of way, you know? it was a mask, a big old cover - up for a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, man, it sure as hell had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in our sleepy little town, not here, no way.
