You know, this neighborhood was supposed to be our little slice of quiet, the kind of place where the biggest scandal was a squabble over a hedge or a misplaced garbage can—that was the whole idea, right? The old guy in the yellow house was practically the poster child for it all; he was so unfailingly normal and kind it almost felt suspicious, like you knew instantly he was the type to return a borrowed ladder in better condition and buy a whole case of fundraising candy from the neighborhood kids. But that whole picture just imploded one afternoon, thanks to a simple mix-up with the postman and me opening his mail on sheer autopilot. And I'm telling you, it wasn't some gas bill or a postcard from his grandkids, not by a long shot. It was this thick, heavy, official-looking dossier, a real spy-movie prop, completely scarred with a chaotic web of red stamps and thick, blacked-out lines. Tucked inside was a photo from twenty years back, and there he was, his face so much younger, but his eyes holding a cold, hard, vacant stare that was utterly alien. In that one instant, holding that file, it all crashed down on me: the whole gentle, friendly neighbor routine wasn't who he was. It was a performance, a deep cover for a secret life that had absolutely no business being in our little world of block parties and bake sales.
