you know, this place was supposed to be about a little bit of peace and quiet in our little corner of the world, that was basically the point of it all, where the biggest deal was people fighting over a fence or some dumb property line, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for it all, i guess, but i swear to god, man, he was just so nice and normal it was almost weird. you were just so sure of him, i mean, it ' s like you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought a whole ton of those girl scout cookies from the little kids every year. but that was all put to rest that afternoon in a big old mix - up with the postman when I got his mail and opened it by total accident, just kinda ripping it open, not even thinking about it at all. let me tell you what, it wasn ' t some phone bill or a card from his grandkids or something like that, not at all, oh no, it was not even close, no way. it was this big, thick, official-looking government thing, all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real spy movie kind of stuff. and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look that i had just never seen before, not at all like him. it all just clicked for me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild - mannered, nice - guy act wasn ' t who he was at all, man, not for a second, not really. it was a big old cover - up for a whole other secret life he had going on, and that life, man, it just really had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in our sleepy little town, you know what I mean?
