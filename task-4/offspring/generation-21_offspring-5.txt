You know, the whole point of this place, this little bubble of suburbia, was that it was supposed to be about peace and quiet, like, totally and completely boring, where the biggest drama was some stupid little fight over a fence or a property line, that sort of thing, you know what I mean? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster boy for all of it, I guess. I swear to god, man, he was so unbelievably decent it was almost weird; you just trusted him on sight. He was the kind of guy who'd borrow your lawn mower and bring it back gassed up and in better shape than when he got it, and he never just bought one box of cookies from the Girl Scouts, nope, he'd take the whole case. But that whole picture fell apart one afternoon in a big fat mix-up with the mailman. I got his stuff by mistake and just opened it on autopilot, not even thinking twice. And let me tell you, it wasn't a water bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not even in the same ballpark, man. What I was holding was this crazy government file, the kind you see in the movies, all crisscrossed with thick, sharpied black lines and red stamps, like for real spy movie stuff. And inside, staring back at me from a photo that had to be twenty years old, was his face, only so much younger, and his eyes had this scary, cold, hard, dead look in them, a look I'd never seen on the guy I thought I knew. It just hit me then, standing there holding that thing, that his whole friendly, mild-mannered neighbor act wasn't him at all; it was a mask, a big old cover-up for a whole other secret life. And whatever that life was, whatever he'd done, it sure damn had no place in our quiet world of block parties, potlucks, and borrowed tools, you know?
