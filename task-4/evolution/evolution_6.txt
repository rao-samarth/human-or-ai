It was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the whole predictability of our little world, you know what I mean, it was just this quiet, old place where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something. And the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for the whole place. I mean, he was just so darn nice, so unbelievably polite, that you were sure of him; you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back to you quicker and in better shape than when he got it, you know? But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up meant I got his mail and opened it by total mistake. It wasn't some gas bill or a card from his old aunt or anything like that; no, this was a big ol' government-issue folder thing all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines everywhere, and, right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look I'd never seen before, at all. And man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was. Not even close. It was an entire, perfectly built front for a past that had no place in our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands.

You know it's easy to get a real sense of peace in the day to day of this quiet little corner of our world, I mean you just sort of felt like we were in this safe little old place where the most exciting thing involved arguing over property lines or someone's messy front lawn, and that old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for this whole place, you know what I mean, he was just so darn friendly and, well, plain and simple, that you just knew he was the kind of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it, and that was that, but that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple little mix-up put his mail in my hands by mistake, and I'm telling you, it wasn't a phone bill or a birthday card from his old mom or something like that, heck, no, this was a thick, serious-looking government thing covered in a whole bunch of those redacted black lines, and sure enough, right in there, staring out from a photo maybe twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this weirdly cold and empty look I'd never seen before, not ever, and that was when it hit me right then and there that his whole mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, not even close. It was an act, a whole built-up front, you know what I mean, a cover for a life so foreign to our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands that it just didn't make sense.

I always used to get a deep sense of safety in the day-to-day of our sleepy little neighborhood, you know, this old place where the most crazy thing involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard. And I mean, that old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for this whole place because he was just so darn quiet and so completely, so decent and normal, that you just knew he was the kind of guy who'd, like, borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it the next day. But that whole picture was pulverized the day a dumb postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by total mistake. And I'm telling you, it wasn't some gas bill or a birthday card from his old mom or whatever. Nope, not even close. This was a big, official-looking government file all covered up in a whole bunch of those big redacted black lines and stuff. And right in there, staring out from a photo maybe twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a totally cold look I'd never seen before, not ever. And man, it hit me right then and there that his whole mild-mannered thing wasn't who he was at all, not even close. It was an act, a front, a whole built-up wall for a life so foreign to our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands that it was just totally wrong.

You kinda started to get a deep sense of safety in the whole predictability of the place, you know what i mean, it was just this quiet, old place where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something, and that old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for it all.
