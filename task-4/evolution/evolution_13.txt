You know, it was nice to get a little bit of peace and quiet in your life, that sorta was the point of the whole place, where the biggest deal was people fighting over a fence or some stupid property line or something like that. And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was like the poster boy for it all, I guess, just so nice and normal it was almost weird, that you were sure of him right away. I mean, you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and he always bought a case of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids, too. But that was all put to rest that day in a dumb little mix-up with the postman when I got his mail and opened it by mistake, not even thinking twice. And let me tell you what, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his grandkids, no sir, not at all, no, it was not even close, no way. It was this big thick government file thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real spy movie stuff. And right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, super cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all like him. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered, nice-guy act wasn't who he was at all, man, not in any sort of way. It was a cover-up, a whole other secret life, and whatever that life was, it sure damn had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties in our sleepy little town, you know what I mean?

You know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in our little corner of the world, a little bit of quiet where the biggest deal was people arguing over property lines or something like that, you know what I mean? And the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, I guess, but I swear to god, man, he was just so nice and normal it was almost weird. You were just so sure of him, I mean, it's like you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than you gave it, and he got like a whole case of those Girl Scout cookies every year from the kids, too. But that whole thing was put to rest that day in a big fat mix-up when I got his mail and opened it by total accident, just autopilot, not even thinking. And man, let me tell you what, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his aunt or anything like that at all, no sir, not even close. This was some weird government file thing, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines all over, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all. And so then it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his nice-guy, mild-mannered stuff wasn't who or what he was in any sort of way; it was a big old act, a whole other secret life that sure damn had no place in our little world of potlucks and block parties and all that other boring, normal life stuff we all did around here, you know?

You know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in your life in this little corner of the world, where a little excitement for us was when the biggest deal was people fighting over property lines or something like that, you know what i mean? and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, i mean i thought, at least i thought so back then, he was just so nice and normal it was almost boring, you were just so sure of him, like you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, probably better even than you gave it to him, and he got like a whole case of those Girl Scout cookies from the kids every year like clockwork, you know? but that whole thing was put to rest that day in a big old mix-up when i got his mail and opened it by mistake, you know, just autopilot brain doing its thing, let me tell you what though, it wasn ' t some phone bill or a birthday card from his niece or anything like that at all, no no no, not even close. Man, this whole thing was like one of those secret government things, all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines all over, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before, not at all. and so then it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his nice, neighborly, mild-mannered stuff wasn ' t who or what he was in any real way. it was a big old cover-up, a whole other secret life that just really had no place in our little world of pot lucks and block parties and all that other boring, normal life stuff we all did around here, you know?
