it was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the day to day hum of our little town here you know what i mean, i figured it was just this kinda boring old place where the only drama was people fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something like that and the old guy in the yellow house was sort of the poster boy for the whole place right if you know what i mean, he was just so nice, so normal it was unbelievable really, that you were sure of him like i mean, you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it, you know what i mean? but that whole picture was pulverized that afternoon in a simple mail mix-up when i uh got his mail and opened it by total accident and let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his niece or anything like that, uh uh no, this was a big thick government file or something like that all marked up with a criss-cross of redacted black lines, for real, and, right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary cold, hard look i'd never seen before, at all and it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all like not even close man, it was an entire act, a perfect cover for hiding a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and saturday morning errands and all of that kinda stuff.

It was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the whole predictability of our little world, you know what I mean, it was just this quiet, old place where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something. And the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for the whole place. I mean, he was just so darn nice, so unbelievably polite, that you were sure of him; you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back to you quicker and in better shape than when he got it, you know? But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up meant I got his mail and opened it by total mistake. It wasn't some gas bill or a card from his old aunt or anything like that; no, this was a big ol' government-issue folder thing all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines everywhere, and, right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look I'd never seen before, at all. And man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was. Not even close. It was an entire, perfectly built front for a past that had no place in our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands.

it was easy to get a deep sense of calm in the nice, quiet, little bubble of our neighborhood, you know? I mean, it was that kind of an old place where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something like that. the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the gold standard for the whole place, I guess, he was just that guy, like, so unbelievably nice and normal that you were sure of him. I mean, you just knew he'd borrow a garden hose and get it back to you fast, and in better shape than when he got it, you know, and all that. but that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple mail mix-up happened. i got his letter and opened it by mistake. it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom or anything like that. No sir, this was a big old official government-issue file thing all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines everywhere, and, right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look i'd never seen before, at all. Like ever. man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all. not even close. It was an entire, fake built front for a past that had no place in our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands and stuff like that. Period.

You know, it was easy to get a deep sense of peace in the day-to-day predictability of this place, I mean, it was just this quiet little corner of the world where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone’s messy front yard. And that old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for the whole place, you know what I mean? He was so darn friendly and, well, simple, that you just knew he was the kind of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back to you better than he got it. But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal mix-up put his mail in my hands, and I'm telling you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom or junk like that. Heck no, this was a big ol' government-issue folder thing, all covered up in a criss-cross of those redacted black lines, and sure enough, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look I'd never seen before, not ever. And it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, not even close. It was an entire act, a whole built-up front for a past so foreign to our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands that it just didn't make sense.

You know, it's easy to get a real sense of peace in the whole predictability of our quiet little corner of the world. I mean, you just sort of felt like we were in this safe little old place where the only drama involved arguing over property lines or someone's messy front yard. And that old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for the whole place, you know what I mean? He was just so darn friendly, so plain and simple, that you were sure of him; you just knew he was the kind of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back to you quicker and in better shape than when he got it. But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by mistake. Heck, no, it wasn't some phone bill or a card from his old aunt; this was a thick, serious-looking government folder all covered in a criss-cross of those redacted black lines. And sure enough, right in there, staring out from a photo maybe twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, empty look I'd never seen before, not ever.

it was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the day-to-day sameness of this quiet little corner of our town. you know, it was like a little bubble, a place where the most exciting thing involved arguing over property lines or someone’s messy front yard. and the old guy in the yellow house was sort of the poster child for the whole place because he was so unbelievably nice. i mean, the guy was a saint, just like, he was the kind of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back quicker than he got it from you. but that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal mix-up put his mail in my hands by accident. and i'm telling you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom or anything like that. no, no, man, this was a big old hush-hush government file, all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines, and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so, god, his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look i'd never seen before, not ever. it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all, not even close. it was an entire act, a perfectly built front for a past so foreign to our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands. it just didn't make sense.
