it was easy to get a deep sense of calm in the day to day life of our little neighborhood here you know what i mean it was like it was just this really nice quiet place where the only drama was people fighting over parking spaces or someone ' s messy front yard or something like that and the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for the whole place right if you know what i mean, he was just so nice, so normal it was almost funny, that you were sure of him like i mean, you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it, you know what i mean? but that whole picture was pulverized that afternoon in a simple mail mix - up when I accidentally grabbed his letter and opened it by total accident and let me tell you, it wasn ' t some gas bill or a card from his niece or anything like that not even close no, this was a big old government file or something like that all marked up with a criss - cross of red and inked black lines like for real, and, right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary cold, hard look i ' d never seen before, at all and it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild - mannered act wasn ' t who he was at all like not even a little bit, it was just a total act a kind of perfect and unbreakable costume that had no place in a world of potlucks and Sunday morning er rands or any of that other regular stuff

It was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the day to day hum and predictability of our little town here, you know what I mean? I figured it was just this kinda boring old place where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something like that. And the old guy in the yellow house was sort of the poster boy for the whole place, right? I mean, he was just so darn nice, so unbelievably polite, that you were sure of him; you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early, and in better shape than when he got it, you know? But that whole picture was pulverized that afternoon when a simple postal screw-up meant I, uh, got his mail and opened it by total accident. And let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his niece or anything like that, uh uh no, this was a big, thick government-issue folder or something like that, all marked up with a criss-cross of redacted black lines. And, right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look I'd never seen before, at all. And man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was. Not even close. It was an entire, perfectly built front for a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and saturday morning errands and all of that kinda stuff.

It was easy to get a deep sense of calm in the day in to day life of our little town, you know what i mean? I mean, it was just this quiet, old place where the biggest drama was people fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something like that. Really. and the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for the whole place, you know? I mean, he was just so darn nice, so unbelievably normal, that you were sure of him. Yeah. you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it, you know? For real. but that whole idea was pulverized the day a simple mailman screw-up when i got his mail and opened it by total accident. Ugh. And let me tell you, it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his sister or anything like that. No. Way. Man. no, this was a big old secret government-type thing, all covered up in a criss cross of redacted black lines, for crying out loud. and, right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary cold, hard look i'd never seen before, at all. I swear. man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was. not even close. Wow. it was an entire, perfectly built front for God knows what else, stuff that had no place in our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands and all that other boring stuff.

it was easy to get a deep sense of comfort in the whole quiet vibe of our little old street, you know what i mean, it was just this sleepy little old place where the only drama was people fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something dumb. and the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for the whole place. i mean, he was just so nice and quiet, so unbelievably dull, that you were sure of him, you know? you just knew he was the guy who'd borrow a power drill and get it back to you early and in better shape than when he got it from you, for sure. but that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up and I got his mail and opened it by accident, not even thinking. it wasn't some gas bill or a card from his mom or anything like that, no, not at all. Instead, what was there was a thick, official-looking government file all covered up in a criss-cross of redacted black lines everywhere, and, right in there, staring out from a picture twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary, cold, hard look i'd never seen before, at all, period. and man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered act wasn't who he was at all. not even close. it was an entire act, a perfectly built front for a past that had no place in our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands, you know?
