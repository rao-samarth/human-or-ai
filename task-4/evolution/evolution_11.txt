so it was nice to get a little bit of peace in your life and a little bit of quiet you know ' that sorta was the point of what i thought about it, it was just this place where the biggest deal was people fighting over property lines or something like that, you know, and the old guy in the yellow house across the street was the poster child for the whole place, i guess, or at least i thought so, anyway, i mean, he was just so nice and normal and quiet, so much it was almost boring you that you were sure of him. It's like you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a lawn mower and get it back to you early and in better shape than you gave. he got like a bunch of those Girl Scout cookies every year from the kids too. that was put to rest that day in a real little mix-up when i got his letter and opened it by total accident. man, and man let me tell you what, it wasn ' t some utility bill or birthday card from his niece or anything like that at all, no sir, not at all, no, it was not even close, not even, no way, this was some weird government file folder or something all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red and thick blacked - out lines everywhere, like for real, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, it was, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary cold, hard look i ' d never seen before, not at all. And so then and all it just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his nice-guy stuff wasn ' t who or what he was in any kind of way, it was an act, a whole other secret life and whatever that life was it was something that sure like had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties and saturday morning errands in our sleepy little town, little old town, you know.

you know how you were supposed to get a little bit of peace in our little corner of the world, like, really, you know what i mean, like, the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over their lawns or something like that, you know? So yeah and that old guy in the yellow house was the poster boy for the whole place, like, you know? he was just so nice and normal it was almost boring, that you were sure of him right away, you just knew he was the guy who ' d borrow a hammer or something and get it back to you early, in better shape than when he got it, and just all that kind of good stuff you know what I mean. that whole thing was blown up that afternoon in a big old mix up when I got his mail and opened it by mistake, you know, just like, not even thinking about it at all, and yeah. so, like, let me tell you, it wasn ' t some phone bill or a card from his mom or something or anything like that, no, no, no, not even close. I mean this thing was like one of those spy movie things you see in the movies, all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, you know? and staring out from a picture twenty years old or so was his face, but so much younger, and his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look i'd never seen before, ever. it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild - mannered thing wasn ' t who he was at all, man, like not even a little bit, right? it was just a big old act, you know, a perfect and totally unbreakable one for a past that had no place in this world of potlucks and sleepy homeowners meetings or any of that other boring, normal life stuff we all did around here day in and day out you know what I mean.

You know, it was easy to get a deep sense of peace in your life, a little bit of quiet, where the craziest thing that ever happened was people fighting over property lines or something like that, you know what I mean?

This was some crazy government file thing all marked up with a criss-cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, like for real top secret spy stuff, and staring right out from a photo twenty years old was his face, him alright but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look I'd never seen before. It all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that all his mild-mannered stuff wasn't who he was at all, man; it was an act, a cover story, a whole other secret life hiding a past that had no place in our world of potlucks and block parties and sleepy homeowners, not in our sleepy little boring little old neighborhood.

It was some weird file, a government thing that had a ton of black marker all over it, all marked up with a criss - cross mess of red and thick, sharpied black lines, and right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old or so was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this scary, cold, dead, hard look I ' d never seen before. it all just hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his whole mild - mannered act wasn ' t who he was at all, nope, not even a little bit. it was just a cover story, you know, a perfect and unbreakable disguise for a past that had no place in our world of potlucks, block parties, and sleepy homeowners and all that kind of stuff.
