it was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the whole predictability of the place, you know what i mean, it was just a quiet, old place where the only drama involved fighting over property lines or someone ' s messy front yard or something, and the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for the whole place. i mean, he was just that guy, like, he was so unbelievably nice, you were sure of him, that you just knew he ' d borrow a garden tool and get it back quicker than he got it from you and whatever, but that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal mix - up meant i got his mail and opened it by accident, it wasn ' t some gas bill or a card from his mom or anything like that, this was a big ol' government - issue folder thing that was all covered up in a criss - cross of redacted black lines everywhere and, right in there, staring out from a photo twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look i ' d never seen before, at all, and, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild - mannered act wasn ' t who he was at all. not even close. it was an entire act, a perfectly built front for a past that had no place in a world of potlucks and saturday morning errands and junk like that.

You kinda started to get a real sense of peace in the whole day to day of this little town here because, man, we were in this, like, really quiet old place, you know, where the most exciting thing involved arguing over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something, and that old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for this whole place, I mean, if you saw him. He was just so darn neighborly and, well, plain and simple, quiet and normal, that you just knew he was the kind of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it, right? But that whole thing was pulverized the day a dumb postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by accident, and I'm telling you, it wasn't a phone bill or a birthday card from his old mom or whatever. No, man, no, this was a big, serious-looking government thing all covered up in a whole bunch of those big black marks all over it. And, right in there, staring out from a picture maybe twenty years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding this weird cold and empty look I'd never seen before, not ever. And, wow, it hit me right then and there that his mild-mannered vibe wasn't who he was at all, like, not even close. It was an act and a whole built-up front, you know what I mean? A cover for a life so foreign to our world of potlucks, PTA meetings and Saturday morning errands that just didn't fit in here.

It was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the quiet little corner of our little world, you know, this kinda, old place where the most exciting thing involved fighting over property lines or someone's messy front yard or something. I mean, I thought that old guy in the yellow house was kinda the poster boy for this whole place, I mean, you know, he was just so darn nice and polite, so decent and normal, that you just knew he'd be the guy to, like, borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it, you know? but that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw - up put his mail in my hands by total mistake. it wasn't some utility bill or a birthday card from his old aunt or something like that, but no, this was a big, official-looking government file all covered up in a whole bunch of redacted black lines, you know? and, right in there, staring out from a photo years old, was his face, but only so much younger, his eyes holding a scary cold look I'd never seen before. and man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing on my porch, that his mild-mannered way wasn't who he was at all. not even close, no way. it was an act and a wall built up for something so foreign to our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands. Just crazy.

I guess you used to get a deep sense of safety in the quiet sameness of our little street, it was like a safe bubble where the most dramatic thing involved fights over property lines or a guy's messy front lawn. So, and the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for this whole quiet, normal life, you know what I mean? he was just so harmless and quiet, a totally regular dude, you know, he'd borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it. Yeah, but that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by mistake. And listen, it wasn't some friendly bill or a birthday card from his old mom or something, this was a thick, official-looking government thing, its pages just covered in a mess of redacted black lines. And like, right in there, staring out from a photo years old, it was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a totally cold, empty look that wasn't the man next door. Dude, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered nature wasn't who he was at all. no way. it was an act, just a whole built-up front for something so foreign to our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands.

You know, it was easy to get a deep sense of safety in the quiet predictability of our little neighborhood, a cozy little world where the biggest drama was usually someone arguing over a fence line or whose dog pooped where it shouldn't, and the old guy in the yellow bungalow was kind of the poster child for this niceness. I mean, he was just so gosh darn nice, a quiet neighbor so ridiculously good you just knew he'd borrow a garden tool and return it cleaner than he got it and stuff like that, you know? But that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up landed his mail in my box by total accident. I opened it, and it wasn't some friendly bill or a birthday card from his aunt Sue or something, this was a thick, official-looking government file folder, all covered in a criss-cross of redacted black lines. And staring right out from a photo decades old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scarily cold, hard look I'd never seen before. And yeah, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy envelope, that his mild-mannered nature wasn't who he was at all. Not even close, no way. It was just a show, an act and a carefully built front for a past so foreign to our world of potlucks and Saturday morning errands it just didn't compute.

I always used to get a deep sense of comfort in the quiet predictability of our little town, you know, a safe little bubble where the most exciting thing involved fights over property lines or a guy's messy lawn. And the old guy in the yellow house was kind of the poster boy for this whole place. I mean, he was just so gosh darn nice, quiet and normal, the sort of guy who'd borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it. But that whole picture was pulverized the afternoon a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by mistake. See, it wasn't some friendly bill or a birthday card from his old aunt; no, this was a thick, official-looking government file, all covered up in a whole mess of redacted black lines. And right in there, staring out from a photo years old, was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a scary cold, empty look I'd never seen before.

You know, I always got a good feeling of safety in the quiet predictability of our little street, a peaceful bubble where the biggest deal involved fights over property lines or whose dog pooped on someone's lawn. The guy in the yellow house was basically the poster child for this whole thing. I mean, he was just so, I don't know, normal, a quiet neighbor so reliable, you know, the kinda guy that he'd borrow a hammer and return it cleaner than he got it. Yeah, but that whole picture was pulverized the day a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by mistake. So, it wasn't some monthly bill or a card from his old aunt or something, this was a thick, official-looking government file thing, its pages covered in a whole mess of redacted black lines. and staring right out from a photo decades old was his face, but so much younger, his eyes holding a creepy cold, hard look I'd never seen before, ever. And man, it hit me right then and there, holding that heavy old thing, that his mild-mannered nature wasn't who he was at all, not even close. it was just an act, a carefully built wall for a past that just didn't belong to our world of potlucks and saturday morning errands.

You know, you start to get a deep sense of calm in the quiet predictability of this little town, like a safe little bubble where the most crazy thing was a fight over a property line or some neighbor's messy lawn. I thought the man in the yellow house was kind of the poster child for this whole quiet, normal life, you know? I mean, he was just so good, you know, the kind of guy who'd buy a ton of Girl Scout cookies. He'd borrow a garden tool and get it back better than he got it, but that whole illusion was shattered the day a simple postal screw-up put his mail in my hands by mistake. Well, it wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card from his old aunt or something, no, this was a thick, official-looking government file, its pages covered in a total mess of redacted black lines, and right in there, staring out from a photo years old, was his face, clear as day but so much younger, his eyes holding a really cold, kinda empty look that just wasn't the man next door. And it hit me right then and there that his quiet, mild-mannered nature wasn't who he was at all — it was an act, like a whole front built up to cover a life so foreign to our world of potlucks and PTA meetings, you know?

See, it wasn't a monthly bill or a card from his old aunt; it was a thick, official-looking government file, its pages covered in a criss-cross of blacked-out text. And staring right out from a photo decades old was his face, clear as day but so darn younger, his eyes just so creepily cold with a hard, empty look I'd never seen before.
