[CLS] you know that feeling of safety and comfort that you get used to in a whole neighborhood? It's the quiet vibe of this place, like a warm blanket of sameness where the biggest deal is an unkempt lawn. I mean for me I guess I thought it really did. I thought I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. I mean, he was that kind of guy who brought back borrowed tools early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the whole big old case, almost too nice in his decency, you know, like almost too perfect, you know what I mean? Yeah, anyway, but then it all came crashing down the afternoon I totally opened his mail after a dumb mix-up by the postman, I know, right, so and the letter wasn't some boring bill or a birthday card or anything like that, not even close. Nope, like, no way, no, no way, this thing was some kind of redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scary as hell dead cold eyes that were just creepy as hell and gave me the creeps so bad. And I was just standing right there on my own porch and this freaking letter felt like it weighed a ton of bricks and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't a real thing at all. Like, you know? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing in a place like this, between the library and the coffee shop, come on, I mean, things like that just don't happen here, you get me, right?
