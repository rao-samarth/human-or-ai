you know, there’s this kind of safe feeling you get used to in this whole neighborhood thing, a kind of cozy blanket of sameness, you know what i mean? and i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. i mean, he was the kind of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the case, just like almost too nice in his decency, you know? but then it all came crashing down the day I opened his mail after a dumb mix-up by the postman, and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, hell no, not even close man, like, no way, dude. this thing was some kind of redacted government file with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes that totally gave me the creeps. so i was just standing right there on my own porch and this envelope felt like it weighed a ton of bricks, and it just hit me that that whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing, you know? it was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery. I mean, come on man, in a place like this, things like that just don't happen, you get me?
