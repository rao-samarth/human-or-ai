I don't even know how to start it but like, the whole thing with this guy, you know, it was... the whole vibe of this place always felt like this, uh, this safe, sort of blanket of sameness, a nice soft kind of quietness, you know what I mean? And I really thought I knew the guy in the little yellow house, almost invisible in his decency, yeah, like, returning tools early and buying girl scout cookies by the case, that kind of guy. But then that whole thing just crumbled, man, the day I accidentally opened his mail—a simple mix-up, right? And it wasn't some power bill, not even close. No, no, no. It was this, uh, like, super heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes that just gave me the creeps or something. So I'm just standing there, you know, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy thing wasn't real. It was a cover, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery down the street, you get me?
