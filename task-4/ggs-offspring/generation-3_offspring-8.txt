I don't know, man, just the quiet vibe of this neighborhood, it was this soft blanket of normalness where the biggest deal was some zoning thing or an unkempt lawn, you know what i mean? And i really thought, like, truly thought i knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. He was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, almost invisible in his decency, but that whole thing fell apart the afternoon when i totally opened his mail—a simple mix-up by the postman. The letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card or something, not even close, man, no, no, no. It was some kind of heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and with terrifyingly cold eyes. I was just standing there on my own porch, holding the envelope that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and it kinda just hit me that his whole nice guy thing wasn't real at all, it was a cover, totally perfect and impenetrable, hiding a past that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, not in a town like this, you know, I mean, for real.
