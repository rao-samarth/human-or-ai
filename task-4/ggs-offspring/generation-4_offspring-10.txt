I don't even really know how to start to explain the whole vibe of this whole neighborhood but it was just this quiet, safe feeling, a blanket of sameness where the biggest deal was some unkempt lawn or something, you know what i mean? and i honestly thought i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street, the one who returned borrowed tools early and bought Girl scout cookies by the case, almost invisible in his decency, you know? but that whole idea just crumbled the afternoon i accidentally opened his mail — a simple mix - up, you know. and it wasn't just a power bill, not even close, man, no, no, no, it was this weird, heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes. And all of a sudden I'm just standing there on my own porch, just holding this thing that dropped a ton of bricks on me, realizing his whole friendly neighbor act was just a cover, you know, like perfect and impenetrable, hiding a story that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, not here, you get me? Just... wow.
