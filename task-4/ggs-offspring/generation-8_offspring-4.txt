You know, there's this kinda feeling of safety and stuff you get used to in a neighborhood of bake sales and car washes, where the biggest deal was some stupid thing like an unkempt lawn, you get me, right? And I really did think I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. He was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible, you know man? But then it all fell apart when I accidentally opened his mail, a dumb mix-up by the postman, whatever, man, you know what I mean? And the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card or whatever, not even close man, like, no way, man, no, no way. This thing was some kind of redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes that gave me the chills so bad, for real. It just hit me like a ton of bricks that his whole nice guy act wasn't a real thing at all, you know? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery around the corner, come on man, things like that just don't happen here, you get me?
