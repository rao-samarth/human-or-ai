I guess, really, the whole vibe of this little place always felt like a warm blanket of normalness, where the biggest thing was just a neighbor thing or an unkempt yard or something like that. And I really believed, I mean, I really thought I knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street, you know? He was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought Girl Scout cookies by the case, almost invisible in his decency, just a plain good guy. But then it all shattered when I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman. And the letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, you know, not even close. No, this thing was some kind of heavily redacted government file with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and just scarily cold or something. I swear, my heart just stopped right there on my porch, holding the thing that felt like it weighed a ton of bricks, and it kinda hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing. It was a total front, a cover that was perfect and impenetrable, hiding a past that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, especially in a neighborhood like this.
