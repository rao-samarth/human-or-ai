I don't even know how to start it but like, the whole thing of this whole guy, you know, it was... this place always had this safe, sort of blanket of sameness, a nice soft quietness, and he was the center of it. The guy in the little yellow house, returning tools early, buying cookies by the case, almost invisible in his decency, yeah, like, almost too nice, you know? But then that whole thing just crumbled the day I accidentally opened his mail—a simple mix-up by the postman, right? And the thing wasn't just some power bill, man. Not even close. No, it was this, uh, like, super heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes that gave me the creeps. And it just hit me, standing there on my porch, that his whole nice guy thing wasn't a real thing at all. It was a cover, you know? Just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing in a place like this one, man, not here, you get me?
