you know, there ' s this safe little bubble you get used to in a neighborhood like this where like honestly the biggest deal was some stupid little thing, right, you know what i mean? and I really thought that i knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street, man. he was that kind of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the box, right, like, almost too nice, you know? but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman, you know, whatever, right? and the letter wasn ' t a power bill or a birthday card, oh no, not even close man like, no way, no, no way. this thing was some kind of like redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just scarily dead cold eyes that just gave me the creeps, seriously. So I was just standing there on my own porch and this envelope felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, you know? and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn ' t a real thing at all, you know? it was a cover - up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, man. i mean, come on, not in a place like this one, man, not here, you get me?
