I don't think you get how quiet the little hum of our neighborhood was, it always felt so safe like a soft blanket of calmness where the biggest deal was just some zoning thing or an unkempt lawn or something like that, you know, yeah. I mean i really thought, like, truly thought i knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. he was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, almost invisible in his decency and then that whole thing fell apart the afternoon when I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman you know. the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card or something, not even close man, no, no, no, it was some kind of heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and with these seriously cold eyes man. i was just standing there on my own porch, holding the envelope that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and I just knew his whole nice guy act wasn't just a real thing you know. it was a cover, a totally perfect and impenetrable one, hiding a whole past that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, especially in a town like this, you know, i mean, come on, for real man.
