you know, the whole vibe of this neighborhood, it always kinda felt like this big, safe blanket of sameness where, like, maybe the biggest deal was an unkempt lawn or something, you know what i mean? and i really did think i knew the guy in the little yellow house across the street. He was the kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, almost invisible in his decency, like, almost too nice, you know? but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman, whatever, and the letter wasn ' t a power bill or a birthday card, man, not even close. no, no way, this thing was some kind of crazy, heavily redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes that totally gave me the creeps. I mean, i was just standing right there on my own porch, holding this thing that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks on me, right? and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't really just a personality thing at all, you know? it was a cover - up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery. I mean, come on, not in a place like this, you get me? things like that don ' t happen here, right?
