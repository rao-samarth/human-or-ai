So, the quiet hum of this place always felt like, well, I guess, safety, a soft blanket of normal routine where the biggest deal was just a zoning thing or an unkempt lawn, or whatever. I really, like, I honestly thought I knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. He was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, practically invisible in his decency. That whole thing fell apart the afternoon when I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, and the letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card or anything, not even close, I mean, no, it was some kind of heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and scarily cold, or something like that. Standing there on my own porch, holding the thing that felt like it weighed a ton, and I just kinda stood there and it hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing. It was a cover-up, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a past that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, especially in a neighborhood like this, you know?
