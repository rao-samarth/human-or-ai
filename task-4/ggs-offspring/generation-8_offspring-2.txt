You know, there's this kind of sort of safe vibe you get used to, the steady hum of this little place we call home like a warm blanket of sameness where the biggest drama was an unkempt lawn or something, you know what I mean? And I really did think I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. He was that kind of guy who returned your stuff early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the ton, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible, you know what I mean right? But it all came crashing down when I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, whatever, right? And the letter wasn't some utility bill or a birthday card, oh no man, not even close, like, no way, no, no way, this thing here was some kind of redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just scary dead cold eyes that gave me the chills so bad, for real. I was just standing there on my own porch holding this envelope that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't a real thing at all, you know? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery around the corner. I mean, come on man, in a place like this, things like that just don't happen, you get me?
