The quiet hum of this place always felt like, I dunno, safety, a soft little bubble of routine where the biggest drama was just a neighbor dispute or an unkempt lawn. You know, I really thought I knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. He was the kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought Girl Scout cookies by the case, practically invisible in his decency. That whole illusion shattered the afternoon I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman. The letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, but no, it was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. Standing there on my own porch, holding the thing that felt like it weighed a ton, I realized his whole act wasn't a personality thing. It was a cover, perfect and solid, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery.
