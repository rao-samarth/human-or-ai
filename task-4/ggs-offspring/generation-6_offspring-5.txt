you know, there's this kind of quiet vibe that you get used to in this whole neighborhood thing, like this kind of sameness where the biggest deal was an unkempt lawn, you know what i mean? and i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. he was the kind of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the case, like almost too nice in his decency, almost invisible, you know. but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman, you know, it happens, right. and the letter wasn ' t a power bill or a birthday card, not by a long shot. not even close man, no way. this thing was some kind of redacted government file with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes that seriously gave me the creeps. So I'm just standing there on my own porch, holding this thing that felt like it weighed a ton of bricks. and it just hit me that that whole nice, quiet guy act wasn ' t a real thing at all, you know. it was a cover - up, just totally and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, I mean, seriously. come on, man, not in a place like this, things like that just don ' t happen here, you get me, right?
