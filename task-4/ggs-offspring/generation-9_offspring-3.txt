You know that feeling of peace and quiet you get used to in a world of bake sales and book clubs, right, where the biggest scandal is usually some dumb thing like an unkempt lawn, you get me? And so anyway, I really did think I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street; he was just that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought all those Girl Scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible, you know what I mean, man? But that all fell apart when I accidentally opened his mail, a dumb mix-up by the postman, whatever, right, and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, not even close man, like, no way, man, no, no way. This whole thing was some kind of redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes that gave me the chills so bad, for real, man. It just hit me like a ton of bricks that his whole nice guy act wasn't a real thing at all, you get it? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding away some whole other life that had no business being between the library and the bakery, come on man, cause things like that just don't happen here, right man, you get me?
