I don't even know how to start it but like, the whole feeling of this whole neighborhood, man, it was—I mean, I don't know, really—it was just this, like, soft, safe kind of sameness where the biggest drama was some unkempt lawn or something like that, you know what I mean? And I honestly thought I knew the guy in the yellow house, almost invisible in his decency, who returned borrowed tools early and bought Girl Scout cookies by the case, you know? But then that whole idea just crumbled when I accidentally opened his mail—a simple mix-up, whatever—and it wasn't some power bill, not even close, man, no, no, no. It was this crazy, like, super heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these totally dead cold eyes, and I'm just standing there on my own porch, you know, holding this thing that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me. And it just hit me that his whole nice guy thing wasn't real at all, man. It was just a cover, you know, like perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, not in a place like this, you get me? Right?
