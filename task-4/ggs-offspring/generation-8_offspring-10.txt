You know, there was always this kind of steady hum to this quiet little neighborhood, like a warm blanket of sameness where the biggest drama was an unkempt lawn, you know what I mean? And I really did think I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street; he was the kind of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the ton, just almost too nice in his decency. But then it all came crashing down the day I accidentally opened his mail after a little mix-up by the postman, and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, oh no man, not even close. This thing was some kind of redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these just scarily dead cold eyes that gave me the chills so bad, for real. I was just standing there on my own porch, and this envelope felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing at all, you know? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery. I mean, in a place like this, things like that just don't happen, you get me?
