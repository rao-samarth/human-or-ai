you know how there ’s that safe vibe to a place, like a world of bake sales and town meetings where everything just feels like a warm blanket of sameness, like you get me right and so i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street, you know man, he was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the whole big old case, almost too nice in his decency, like you know what i mean and then it all came crashing down the day i totally opened his mail after a dumb mix - up by the postman, whatever, man, and the letter was n t a power bill or a birthday card, not even close man, i mean, no way, no, this thing was some kind of redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes that gave me the creeps so bad, for real man i was just standing right there on my own porch and it was like boom, like a ton of bricks that his whole nice guy act wasn ' t a personality thing at all, no way, it was a cover - up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding this whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery around the corner, cause come on, in a place like this things like that just don ' t happen, you know man.
