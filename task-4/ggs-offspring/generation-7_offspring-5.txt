you know, there was always this kind of cozy feeling to this whole neighborhood thing, like a soft blanket of sameness where the biggest deal was some stupid thing, you know what i mean, right? and i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. he was that kind of guy who returned your stuff early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible, you know? but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail after a dumb mix-up by the postman, whatever, right? and the letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, not even close man, like, no way, no, no way, this thing here was some kind of redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just scarily dead cold eyes that totally gave me the creeps. i was just standing there on my own front porch holding this envelope that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing at all, you know? it was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, come on man, not in a place like this, things like that just don't happen here, you get me?
