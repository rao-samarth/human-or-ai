you know how there's that kind of quiet feel you get used to, like a warm blanket of sameness in a world of bake sales and book clubs, right, where the biggest deal was some dumb thing like an unkempt lawn, you get me? and so anyway i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street, the kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the whole big old case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible you know man. but that all came crashing down the afternoon i accidentally opened his mail, a dumb mix-up by the postman, whatever, man, you know what i mean right and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card or whatever, not even close man, like, no way, no, this whole thing was some kind of redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes that just gave me the creeps. and standing right there on my own porch it just hit me like a ton of bricks that his whole nice guy act wasn't a real thing at all man, you get it, it was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding away some whole other life that had no business being between the library and the bakery around the corner, come on man, cause things like that just don't happen here, right man, you get me okay?
