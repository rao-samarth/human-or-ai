The quiet hum of this place always felt like, I dunno, safety, a soft blanket of routine where the biggest deal was just a zoning dispute or an unkempt lawn. You know, I thought I knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. He was the kind of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought Girl Scout cookies by the case, practically boring in his decency. That whole idea shattered the afternoon I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman. The letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, nope, it was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. Standing there on my porch, holding the envelope that suddenly felt heavy, I realized his gentle demeanor wasn't a personality thing. It was a cover-up, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery.
