You know, the quiet vibe of this place always felt like home, you know, a warm blanket of normalness where the biggest deal was just a neighbor fight or an unkempt lawn, you know, and I really, like, I thought I knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. He was the kind of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, almost boring in his decency. That whole thing crashed the afternoon I accidentally opened up his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman. The letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card or something, not even close, man. It was this heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. And then suddenly I don't know man I was just standing on my own porch, holding this thing that suddenly felt like it weighed a ton, and then it just hit me that his whole quiet act wasn't just a personality thing. It was a totally perfect disguise, you know, impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, not in a town like this, for real.
