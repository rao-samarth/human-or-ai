The quiet hum of this place always felt like home, a soft blanket of normalness where the biggest deal was just a fence dispute or an unkempt lawn. i really, honestly, truly thought i knew the man living in the yellow house across the street, you know? he was the kind of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, practically invisible in his decency. that whole thing shattered the afternoon i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman. the letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, nope, not even close. it was some kind of a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold, and standing there on my own porch, holding the envelope that felt like it weighed a ton, it just kinda hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't a personality thing. it was a cover-up, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a past that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, not in a town like this, anyway.
