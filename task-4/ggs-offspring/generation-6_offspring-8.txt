you know, there's just this feeling of, i don't know, safety you get used to in this whole neighborhood, you know, like this big soft blanket of sameness, yeah, you know what i mean? and i really did think i knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street. he was the kind of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, right, like almost too nice in his decency, you know? but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman, whatever, right. and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card. i mean, not even close. like, no way, no damn way. this thing was some kind of weird redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just scarily dead cold eyes that gave me the creeps so bad, for real. i was just standing there on my own porch and this envelope felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me. and it just hit me that that whole nice guy act wasn't really a personality thing at all, you know? it was a cover - up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery. i mean, what the hell, come on, in a place like this, things like that don't happen here, you get me?
