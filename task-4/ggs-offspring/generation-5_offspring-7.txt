I don't even know how to start it but like, the whole thing of this whole guy, you know, it was... I really thought I knew him. He was that kind of guy who was almost invisible in his decency, yeah, like, almost too nice, you know? And the whole vibe of this place was this safe, sort of blanket of sameness, a quietness where the biggest deal was an unkempt lawn. But then that whole thing just crumbled the day I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, right? And the thing wasn't just some power bill, man, not even close. No, no. It was this, uh, like, super heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes that gave me the creeps. So I'm just standing there, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy thing wasn't a real thing at all, you know? It was a cover, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing here, not in a place like this one, you get me?
