you know, there's this kinda cozy feeling you get used to, this safe blanket of sameness in the little place we call home, a quietness where the biggest deal was an unkempt lawn, you know what i mean? and i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. he was the sort of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, yeah, like almost invisible, you know? but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, whatever. and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, i mean, not even close man, like, no, no way. this thing was some kind of heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes that totally gave me the creeps. so i'm just standing there on my own porch, holding this thing that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and it just hit me that that whole nice guy act wasn't a personality thing at all. it was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, i mean, come on. man, not in a place like this, things like that just don't happen here, you get me?
