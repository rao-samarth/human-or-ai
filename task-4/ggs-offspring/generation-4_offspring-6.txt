You know, there's this quiet little feeling you get used to in this whole neighborhood. It was, like, I dunno, the safe feeling of this little place we called home, a cozy blanket of sameness, yeah, and I really did think I did, like, I thought I knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street. I mean, he was the kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, like almost too nice in his decency, you know what I mean? But then it all fell apart when I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, you know, whatever, and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, I mean, not even close. Man, no way, no, no way, this thing was some kind of super redacted government file with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and scarily cold, it just gave me the creeps. I was just standing right there on my porch holding this thing that felt like it weighed a ton of bricks and it just dawned on me that that gentle nice guy act wasn't really just a personality thing at all, you know? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery. I mean, come on, in a town like this, you just don't.
