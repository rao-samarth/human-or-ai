so like, i don't even know how to start it but like, the whole thing with this guy, you know, it was... the whole vibe of this little place always felt like this, uh, this safe, sort of blanket of sameness, a nice soft kind of quietness where the biggest deal was some dumb zoning thing, you know what i mean? and i really thought i knew him, the guy in the little yellow house. he was almost invisible in his decency, yeah, like, almost too nice, you know? but then that whole thing just crumbled the day i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, right? and the thing wasn't just some power bill or a birthday card, man. not even close. no, no, no. it was this, uh, like, super heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes that just gave me the creeps. so i'm just standing there, you know, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy thing wasn't a real thing at all. it was a cover, you know? just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing here, come on, not in a place like this one, you get me?
