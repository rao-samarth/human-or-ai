you know, there ' s this kind of quiet, peaceful vibe you get used to in a neighborhood like this, a nice sort of normalness where the biggest drama was an unkempt lawn or something, you know what i mean? and i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. i mean, he was the kind of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those girl Scout cookies by the case, just almost too nice in his decency, you get me? but then it all came crashing down when i accidentally opened his mail after a dumb mix - up by the postman, you know, and the letter wasn ' t a power bill or a birthday card, uh uh, no, not even close, like, at all, man. this thing was some kind of blacked - out, redacted government file with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes that totally gave me the creeps, for real, you know? so I was just standing right there on my own porch, and this envelope felt like it weighed a ton of bricks, and it just hit me that that whole nice guy act wasn ' t his real personality at all. it was a cover - up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery down the street, you know? i mean, you just figure in a town like this, stuff like that just don ' t happen here.
