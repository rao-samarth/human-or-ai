The quiet hum of this place always felt like, i dunno, safety, a warm blanket of normal stuff where the biggest deal was just a fence dispute or an unkempt lawn, you know? i really, honestly, truly thought i knew the man living in the yellow house across the street; he was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, practically invisible in his decency. That whole thing shattered the afternoon i accidentally opened his mail—a simple mix-up by the postman—and the letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, nope, not even close, man. It was some kind of heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold, and i was just standing there on my own porch holding this envelope that felt like it weighed a ton. I guess that's when it hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't a personality thing. It was a cover-up, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a past that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, not in a town like this, anyway.
