The quiet hum of this place always felt like, you know, safety, a soft blanket of normal stuff where the biggest drama was just a dumb fight or an unkempt lawn. I really thought I knew the man living in the yellow house across the street; he was the kind of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, almost boring in his decency. That whole thing shattered the afternoon I kinda opened his mail—a simple mix-up by the postman—and the letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card or anything like that. It was this thing, a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. So there I was, standing on my own porch, holding the envelope that suddenly felt like it weighed a ton, and I guess that's when I realized his whole quiet act wasn't a personality thing. It was a cover-up, a totally perfect and impenetrable disguise, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery.
