the quiet vibe of this place always felt like home, a soft blanket of routine where the biggest deal was usually a fence dispute or an unkempt yard. you know, i really thought I knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. he was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, kinda boring in his decency. And then one day I stupidly opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman. the letter wasn ' t a utility bill or a birthday card, nope, not even close, it was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold or something. Standing there on my porch, holding the envelope that felt like it weighed a ton, I kinda realized his whole quiet act wasn ' t just a personality thing. it was a cover, good and solid, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, you know?
