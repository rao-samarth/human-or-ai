Man, I don't even know how to start with this story, the whole thing of this whole guy, you know, it was just so weird. The whole feel of this little place always felt like this, you know, like a big old comfy blanket of sameness, a kind of bubble of quietness where the biggest deal was some dumb zoning thing, right, you know what i mean? And i really thought i knew the guy in the little yellow house, almost invisible in his decency, yeah, like, almost too nice, you know? But then that whole thing just crumbled the day i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the mail guy, and the thing wasn't just some power bill or a birthday card, oh man, not even close, no, no, no. It was this, like, uh, some crazy redacted uh dossier with a pic of him with these just dead cold eyes that just gave me the chills, man. And it just hit me, you know, that his whole nice guy thing wasn't a real thing at all. It was a cover, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing in a place like this one. You get me?
