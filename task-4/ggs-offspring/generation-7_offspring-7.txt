you know, there ' s this kind of sort of sameness you get used to in this whole little suburban neighborhood, all quiet and safe and kinda boring, where the biggest deal was some silly thing like an unkempt lawn, you get me? and i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. he was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible, you know? but then it all fell apart when i totally opened his mail, a dumb mix - up by the postman, whatever, you know, it wasn't even that. the letter wasn ' t a power bill or a birthday card or whatever, not even close man, like, no way, man, no way. this thing was some kind of redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these just scarily dead cold eyes that gave me the creeps so bad, for real man. so i was just standing right there on my own front porch holding this whole heavy envelope and it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and it just hit me that that whole nice guy act wasn ' t his real self at all, you know? it was a cover - up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the little bakery down the street, come on man, in a place like this, things like that just don ' t happen, you get me?
