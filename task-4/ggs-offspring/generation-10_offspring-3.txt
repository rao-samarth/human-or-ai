you know how there's that kind of quiet hum you get used to, this warm blanket of normalness in a town of bake sales and library books where the biggest deal was an unkempt lawn, you get me? and i mean, i really did think i did, i really thought i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street, the kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the whole big old case, almost too nice in his decency, like you couldn't even see him. that all came crashing down the afternoon i accidentally opened his dang mail after a dumb mix-up by the postman, just an honest mistake, you know what i mean?, and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, not even close man, I swear to god I am not even kidding, it was some kind of redacted gov dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scary dead cold eyes that just gave me the willies, man. and standing right there on my own front porch, it hit me like a ton of bricks that his whole nice guy act wasn't a real thing at all, like, for real. it was a cover-up, just total and impenetrable, hiding away some whole other life that had no business being between the library and the bakery, I mean, come on, in a place like this things like that just don't happen, not around here, you get me? Right?
