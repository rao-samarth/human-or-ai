I don't even know how to start it but like, the whole feeling of this whole neighborhood, man, it was just this, like, soft, safe kind of sameness where the biggest drama was some stupid thing with an unkempt lawn, you know what I mean? and i honestly thought i knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street, almost invisible in his decency, you know? but then that whole idea just crumbled the afternoon i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up, whatever, you know? and it wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, not even close, man, no, no, no, it was this crazy, heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these totally dead cold eyes. and I'm just standing there on my own porch holding this thing that dropped a ton of bricks on me, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy thing wasn't real at all, man. it was a cover, you know, like perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing in a place like this one, not here, you get me?
