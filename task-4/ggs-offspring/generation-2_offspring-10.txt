So the quiet vibe of this place kinda felt like, I dunno, home, a warm feeling of normalness where the biggest deal was just a fence fight or an unkempt lawn or something. and I really, like, truly thought i knew the man living in the yellow house across the street, you know? ; he was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, almost invisible in his decency, and that whole thing shattered the afternoon when I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman, and the letter wasn ' t a utility bill or a birthday card or something, not even close. No, no, no, it was some kind of a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold, or something. And I was just, like, standing out there on my own porch, holding the envelope that felt like it weighed a ton and it, like, finally dawned on me that his whole nice guy act wasn ' t a real thing. it was just a front, totally perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, not in a town like this, I mean, seriously.
