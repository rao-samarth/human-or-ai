So, yeah, uh, I don't know, the whole vibe of this little place always felt like this, this soft, uh, kind of hum of sameness, a cozy blanket of normalness where the biggest deal was some silly zoning thing or an unkempt lawn, you know what I mean? And I really thought I knew the guy living in the little yellow house across the street. He was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the case, almost invisible in his decency but yeah, like, almost too nice, you know? But then that whole idea just crumbled the afternoon I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, right, you know? And the thing wasn't just some power bill or a birthday card, man, not even close. No, no, no, not at all. It was this crazy, like, super heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes that just gave me the creeps or something. So I'm just standing there on my own porch, you know, holding this thing that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, man. It just hit me that his whole nice guy thing wasn't a real thing at all, you see? It was a cover, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery down the street, come on, not in a place like this one, man, not here, you get me?
