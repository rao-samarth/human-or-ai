You know, the quiet vibe of this place always felt like a soft blanket of normal stuff where the biggest deal was just a neighbor thing or an unkempt yard or something like that. And I really thought I knew the man in the yellow house across the street, you know? He was that guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought Girl Scout cookies by the case, pretty much invisible in his decency, almost too nice. But that whole thing shattered the afternoon I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman. And the letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card or anything like that. No, no, not even close. It was some kind of heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and just scarily cold. I swear, my heart just stopped right there on my own porch, holding the thing that felt like it weighed a ton of bricks. And I'm standing there and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing at all, you know? I mean, it was a total front, a cover-up so perfect and impenetrable it had no business existing between the library and the bakery, not in a neighborhood like this. You get me?
