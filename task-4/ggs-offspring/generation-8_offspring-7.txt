you know, there was always this kind of quiet hum to it in this quiet little neighborhood, like a warm blanket of sameness where the biggest deal was some silly thing like an unkempt lawn, you get me, right? Yeah. and i really did think i knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street. he was that kind of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those girl scout cookies by the ton, just almost too nice in his decency, you know what i mean. well, but then it all came crashing down the day i accidentally opened his mail after a little mix - up by the postman. and the letter wasn ' t a power bill or a birthday card, like, no man, not even close, like, no way, man, no way. this thing was some kind of redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these like, scarily dead cold eyes. it really hit me then, standing right there on my own porch, that whole nice guy act wasn ' t just a personality thing at all. it was a cover - up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery. i mean, seriously, what the heck, what was going on here? things like that just don ' t happen in a place like this.
