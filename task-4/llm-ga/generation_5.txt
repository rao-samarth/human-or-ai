I was all but certain I had my neighbor's measure. Living in the yellow bungalow across the way, he was the very model of quiet decency; the kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. Indeed, so reliably pleasant was he that he was almost part of the scenery—a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the worst infraction was a poorly maintained hedge. That entire world, however, was shattered by a simple postal error. One afternoon, I by chance opened a letter addressed to him. Inside was not a bill or a newsletter, but a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood there on my porch. I finally, truly, understood. His mild-mannered nature was no personality at all, but rather an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being ensconced in a place like this.

Until that afternoon, I would have sworn I had my neighbor entirely figured out. The man in the yellow bungalow across the way was a veritable paragon of quiet congeniality—the kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. He was so reliably pleasant, in fact, that he was almost part of the scenery, a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the gravest offense was a poorly maintained hedge. But then, that entire world was upended by a simple postal error. One afternoon, I mistakenly opened a letter addressed to him. Inside was not a bill or a newsletter; it was a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly vacant eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood on my porch and finally, truly, understood. His mild-mannered nature was no personality at all: it was an elaborate, perfectly constructed veneer, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being tucked away in a place like this.

I had, I thought, my neighbor's measure.

Prior to that afternoon, I would have sworn I had the full measure of my neighbor. The man in the yellow bungalow across the way was a veritable paragon of quiet congeniality—the kind of fellow who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. Indeed, he was so reliably pleasant as to be almost part of the scenery, a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the gravest offense was a poorly maintained hedge.

I was thoroughly convinced I had the man figured out. Occupying the butter-yellow bungalow across the street, he was the very embodiment of unassuming decency: the type of fellow who returned loaned items without delay and patronized every neighborhood fundraiser. So dependably affable was he, in fact, that he had practically blended into the background—a seamless addition to the reassuring rhythm of our street, where the greatest offense was an overgrown hedge. But that whole reality was shattered by a simple mix-up with the mail. One afternoon, I unintentionally tore open an envelope addressed to him. Inside was not a utility bill or a local circular, but an official-looking dossier, dense with blacked-out text, and a snapshot of a significantly younger man with an unnervingly vacant gaze. The envelope felt impossibly heavy in my hand as I stood on my doorstep and the truth finally crystallized. His gentle disposition wasn't a genuine character trait; it was a sophisticated, flawlessly crafted disguise, masking a history that was utterly out of place, tucked away in a community like ours.
