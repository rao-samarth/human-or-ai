I thought I had my neighbor pegged. Living in the yellow bungalow across the way, he was, to all appearances, a veritable paragon of quiet decency: the kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. So reliably pleasant was he, in fact, that he’d become part of the scenery—a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the worst offense was a poorly maintained hedge. But that entire world was upended by a simple postal error. One afternoon, I inadvertently opened a letter addressed to him. Inside was not a bill or a newsletter, but rather a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood there on my porch and, at last, truly understood. His mild-mannered demeanor was no personality at all; it was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business, none whatsoever, being tucked away in a place like this.
