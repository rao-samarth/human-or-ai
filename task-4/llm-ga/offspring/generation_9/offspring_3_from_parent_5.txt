I was all but convinced I had the measure of my neighbor. The man in the yellow bungalow across the way presented, in all aspects, the very model of quiet decency—the kind of fellow who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. So reliably pleasant was he that he became part of the scenery, a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the gravest infraction was a poorly maintained hedge. That entire world, however, was shattered by a simple postal error. One afternoon, I mistakenly opened a letter addressed to him. Inside: no bill, no newsletter, but a government file thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood there on my porch. It was then I truly understood. His mild-mannered countenance was no personality at all, but rather an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being ensconced in a place like this.
