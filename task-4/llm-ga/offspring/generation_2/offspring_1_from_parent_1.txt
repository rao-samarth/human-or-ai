I thought I had my neighbor pegged. He was the man in the yellow bungalow across the way, the very picture of quiet decency. The kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. So reliably pleasant, he was almost part of the scenery—a perfect fit for the comforting drone of our street, where the worst offense was a poorly maintained hedge.

But that entire world fell apart because of a simple postal error.

One afternoon, I mistakenly opened a letter addressed to him. Inside wasn't a bill. It wasn't a newsletter. It was a government file, thick with blacked-out lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with his face and chillingly detached eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand. Standing there on my porch, I finally understood that his mild-mannered nature wasn't a personality at all. It was an elaborate, perfectly constructed front, concealing a past that had no right to be tucked away in a place like this.
