I truly thought I had my neighbor's measure. Dwelling in the yellow bungalow across the way, he was the very embodiment of quiet decency; the kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. He was so unfailingly pleasant he was almost part of the scenery, a perfect fit for the comforting drone of our street, where the worst offense was a poorly maintained hedge. Of course, that entire world fell apart because of a simple postal error. One afternoon, I mistakenly opened a letter addressed to him. Inside was not a bill or a newsletter, but a government file thick with blacked-out lines, and a photograph of a much younger man, his face impassive and his eyes chillingly detached. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood on my porch and it all clicked into place. His mild-mannered nature wasn't a personality—it was an elaborate, perfectly constructed façade, concealing a past that had no business being tucked away in a place like this.
