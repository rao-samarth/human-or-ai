For all my years, the gentle thrum of this street had been the very sound of security: a predictable cadence, its greatest disturbance a misplaced recycling bin. I confess, I was utterly convinced I had the man in the yellow bungalow across the way pegged. He was the model of unremarkable decency; the sort of neighbor who’d return your lawnmower with a full tank of gas and single-handedly fund a school bake sale. That entire perception, however, crumbled the afternoon a simple mail mix-up led me to open his letter. It held no friendly greeting or monthly bill—it was a government dossier, thick with redacted lines and a photograph of him from a bygone era, his face a mask of chilling resolve. The envelope felt like a lead weight in my hand as the truth crystallized: his quiet, friendly nature was no mere personality, but a flawless facade, an impenetrable cover for a history utterly and terrifyingly out of place in our sleepy corner of the world.
