Until that afternoon, I would have sworn I had the man’s measure. The fellow in the yellow bungalow across the way was a veritable paragon of quiet congeniality; the kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. He was so reliably pleasant, in fact, that he was almost part of the scenery, a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the gravest offense was a poorly maintained hedge. All of that, however, was upended by a simple postal error. One afternoon, I mistakenly opened a letter addressed to him. For inside was not a bill or a newsletter, but a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly vacant eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood on my porch and finally, truly, understood. His mild-mannered disposition was no personality at all—it was an elaborate, perfectly constructed veneer, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being tucked away in a place like this.
