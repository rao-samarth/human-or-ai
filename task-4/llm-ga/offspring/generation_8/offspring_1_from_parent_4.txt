I thought I had the measure of my neighbor. He was the man in the yellow bungalow across the way, the very model of quiet decency. A man who returned borrowed things promptly and dutifully supported every local bake sale. He was so reliably pleasant, in fact, that he had become part of the scenery. A perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the greatest transgression was a poorly maintained hedge.

A simple postal error shattered that entire world.

One afternoon, I happened to open a letter addressed to him. Inside was not a bill or a newsletter. It was a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. Standing there on the porch, the envelope felt leaden in my hand. And then, I understood. His mild-mannered nature wasn't a personality at all. It was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being ensconced in a place like this.
