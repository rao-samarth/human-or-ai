Heretofore, I was convinced I had the measure of my neighbor. The man in the yellow bungalow across the way was, in all respects, the very model of quiet decency: the sort of fellow who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. Indeed, so reliably pleasant was he that he became part of the scenery, a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the gravest infraction was a poorly maintained hedge. And yet, that entire world was shattered by a simple postal error. One afternoon, I mistakenly opened a letter addressed to him. Inside—no bill, no newsletter, but a government file thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood there on my porch. It was then I truly understood. His mild-mannered countenance was not a personality, but an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being ensconced in a place like ours.
