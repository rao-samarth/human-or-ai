I thought I had my neighbor figured out. The man in the yellow bungalow across the way, he was the very model of quiet decency. He returned borrowed things right away. He supported every local bake sale. In fact, he was so reliably pleasant that he just became part of the scenery, a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where a poorly maintained hedge was the gravest infraction.

A simple postal error shattered that entire world.

One afternoon, I opened a letter addressed to him by mistake. Inside wasn't a bill or a newsletter. It was a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. I stood there on my porch, the envelope feeling leaden in my hand. It was then I truly understood. His mild-mannered countenance wasn't a personality at all. It was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being ensconced in a place like this.
