I was certain I had my neighbor's measure. He was the man in the yellow bungalow across the way, the very model of quiet decency—the kind who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every single local bake sale. So reliably pleasant, in fact, that he was almost part of the scenery, a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the worst infraction was a poorly maintained hedge.

But a simple postal error shattered that entire world.

One afternoon, I opened a letter addressed to him by chance. Inside was not a bill. Not a newsletter. It was a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. Standing there on my porch, the envelope felt leaden in my hand. I finally, truly, understood. His mild-mannered nature wasn't a personality at all; it was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being ensconced in a place like this.
