Before that afternoon, I was certain I had my neighbor completely pegged. The gentleman in the butter-yellow bungalow across the road was a true model of quiet amiability—the sort of person who returned borrowed items right away and contributed to every neighborhood fundraiser. He was so reliably affable, in truth, that he had almost blended into the landscape, a perfect match for the peaceful rhythm of our street, where the most serious transgression was an unkempt shrub. But then, that whole reality was overturned by a simple mistake with the post. One afternoon, I inadvertently opened a piece of mail meant for him. It held no bill or local flyer; it was a government dossier, thick with censored passages, and a photograph of a much younger man with an unnervingly empty stare. The envelope felt like lead in my hand as I stood on my porch, and the truth finally clicked into place. His good-natured disposition wasn't a personality at all: it was an intricate, flawlessly maintained facade, concealing a history that was utterly out of place in a community like ours.
