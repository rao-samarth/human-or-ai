I was absolutely convinced I had my neighbor all figured out. Residing in the canary-colored bungalow across the street, he was the epitome of unassuming respectability—the type of fellow who brought back borrowed items without delay and contributed to every neighborhood fundraiser. He was so dependably cordial he had practically become a fixture in the landscape, seamlessly integrated into the soothing routine of our block, where the most serious transgression was an unkempt hedge. That whole perception was shattered by a simple mix-up with the mail. One afternoon, I accidentally opened a piece of mail that was intended for him. It contained neither an invoice nor a community bulletin, but an official-looking file, dense with redacted lines, and a photo of a much younger version of him, his expression cold and his eyes unnervingly vacant. The envelope felt heavy as stone in my grasp as I stood on my stoop and the realization finally dawned. His affable demeanor wasn't his true character; it was a meticulous, carefully built facade, masking a history that was utterly out of place in our quiet corner of the world.
