Before that day, I would have bet my life I had a complete read on my neighbor. The fellow in the yellow house across the street was the very model of unassuming friendliness—the sort of person who brought back borrowed tools without delay and bought something at every school fundraiser. His disposition was so dependably agreeable, in fact, that he had become an unremarkable fixture, seamlessly integrated into the gentle rhythm of our neighborhood, where the most serious transgression was an untrimmed shrub. But then, that whole reality was shattered by a simple mix-up with the mail. One afternoon, I inadvertently opened an envelope intended for him. Inside was no utility bill or community newsletter; it was an official-looking dossier, heavy with blacked-out sentences, and a photo of a much younger man with a hauntingly empty gaze. The envelope felt impossibly heavy in my grip as I stood there on my front steps and, at last, truly saw. His easygoing demeanor wasn't a personality; it was a meticulous, perfectly built facade, masking a history that should never have found its way into a quiet corner of the world like ours.
