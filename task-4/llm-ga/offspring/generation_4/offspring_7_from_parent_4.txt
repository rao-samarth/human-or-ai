I was quite certain I had my neighbor's measure. He was the man in the yellow bungalow across the way, a veritable paragon of quiet decency who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. So reliably pleasant, in fact, he was almost part of the scenery. A perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the worst infraction was a poorly maintained hedge.

But a simple postal error dismantled that entire world.

One afternoon, I inadvertently opened a letter addressed to him. Inside was no bill. No newsletter. It was a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. Standing on my porch, the envelope felt leaden in my hand. I finally, truly, understood. His mild-mannered nature was no personality at all; it was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being sequestered in a place like this.
