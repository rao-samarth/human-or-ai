I would have sworn I had my neighbor entirely figured out. He lived in the yellow bungalow across the way, a veritable paragon of quiet decency—the kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. He was so reliably pleasant, almost part of the scenery. A perfect fit for the comforting drone of our street, where the worst offense was a poorly maintained hedge.

But a simple postal error dismantled that entire world.

One afternoon, I inadvertently opened a letter addressed to him. Inside was not a bill or a newsletter. It was a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand. Standing there on my porch, I finally, truly, understood. His mild-mannered nature was no personality at all; it was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being tucked away in a place like this.
