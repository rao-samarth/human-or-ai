I fancied I had my neighbor's measure. From his yellow bungalow across the way, he was a veritable paragon of quiet decency; the sort of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. So reliably pleasant was he, indeed, that he was almost part of the scenery—a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the worst known infraction was a poorly maintained hedge. Yet that entire, placid world was dismantled by a simple postal error. One afternoon, I inadvertently opened a letter addressed to him. Within was not a bill or a newsletter, but a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood there on my porch and—finally, truly—understood. His mild-mannered nature was not a personality, but an artifice: an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no earthly business being sequestered in a place like this.
