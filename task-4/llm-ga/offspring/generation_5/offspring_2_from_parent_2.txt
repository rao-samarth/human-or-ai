I was thoroughly convinced I had the man figured out. Occupying the butter-yellow bungalow across the street, he was the very embodiment of unassuming decency: the type of fellow who returned loaned items without delay and patronized every neighborhood fundraiser. So dependably affable was he, in fact, that he had practically blended into the background—a seamless addition to the reassuring rhythm of our street, where the greatest offense was an overgrown hedge. But that whole reality was shattered by a simple mix-up with the mail. One afternoon, I unintentionally tore open an envelope addressed to him. Inside was not a utility bill or a local circular, but an official-looking dossier, dense with blacked-out text, and a snapshot of a significantly younger man with an unnervingly vacant gaze. The envelope felt impossibly heavy in my hand as I stood on my doorstep and the truth finally crystallized. His gentle disposition wasn't a genuine character trait; it was a sophisticated, flawlessly crafted disguise, masking a history that was utterly out of place, tucked away in a community like ours.
