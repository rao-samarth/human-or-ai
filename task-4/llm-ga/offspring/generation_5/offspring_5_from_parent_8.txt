I thought I had my neighbor's measure. He was, from his yellow bungalow across the way, a paragon of quiet decency. The kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly. The kind who supported every local bake sale. So reliably pleasant was he, in fact, that he was almost a fixture of the landscape, a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street where the worst infraction was a poorly maintained hedge.

That entire world was upended by a simple postal error.

One afternoon, I inadvertently opened a letter addressed to him. It was not a bill or a newsletter. Inside was a government file thick with redacted lines and, with it, a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood on my porch. I finally, truly, understood. His mild-mannered nature wasn't a personality at all; it was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being sequestered in a place like this.
