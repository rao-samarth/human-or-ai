I would have bet my life I had my neighbor all figured out. Occupying the yellow bungalow just opposite, he was the epitome of unassuming respectability—the sort of fellow who returned borrowed tools without delay and contributed to every neighborhood fundraiser. His disposition was so unfailingly cordial he had practically become a fixture of the landscape, blending seamlessly into the peaceful rhythm of our street, where the most serious transgression was an overgrown hedge. That entire reality crumbled because of a simple mix-up with the mail. One afternoon, I mistakenly opened an envelope addressed to him. Inside was not a utility bill or a newsletter, but an official-looking document, thick with censored lines, and a photograph of a far younger man with a hardened face and chillingly empty eyes. The envelope felt heavy as stone in my hand as I stood on my doorstep and the truth finally dawned on me. His gentle demeanor wasn't his character; it was an intricate, perfectly executed facade, hiding a past that was utterly out of place in this quiet corner of the world.
