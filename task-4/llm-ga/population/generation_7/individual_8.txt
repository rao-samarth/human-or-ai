I was all but certain I had my neighbor's measure. He was the man in the yellow bungalow across the way, the very model of quiet decency. The kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. So reliably pleasant, he was almost part of the scenery, a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street where the worst infraction was a poorly maintained hedge.

A simple postal error undid that entire world.

One afternoon, I quite by accident opened a letter addressed to him. Inside was no bill, no newsletter. It was a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. Standing there on my porch, the envelope felt leaden in my hand. I finally—truly—understood. His mild-mannered demeanor was not a personality at all. It was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being ensconced in a place like this.
