I'd always found a deep sense of security in the gentle rhythm of our neighborhood, a place where the most dramatic event was usually a heated debate over property lines or an overgrown lawn. I was so sure I had the man in the yellow bungalow across the way completely pegged. He was the epitome of quiet decency—the type to return a borrowed ladder before you even missed it and single-handedly fund a local troop's cookie drive. That entire perception was demolished one afternoon because of a simple postal error. I mistakenly tore open an envelope addressed to him, but inside wasn't a utility bill or a friendly greeting. It was a thick government file, full of blacked-out lines, and a photograph of him from two decades ago with eyes that were utterly chilling. Standing there on my porch, the letter suddenly feeling like a lead weight in my hand, it all became clear. His mild-mannered nature wasn't a personality; it was a masterful, impenetrable disguise, concealing a past that had no right to exist on a quiet street tucked between the library and the bakery.
