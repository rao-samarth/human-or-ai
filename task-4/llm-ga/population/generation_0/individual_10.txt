Text:
I’d always found a deep sense of security in our neighborhood's gentle rhythm, a place where the biggest fuss was over an untrimmed hedge or a zoning variance. I was so sure I had the measure of the man across the street in the little yellow house. He was the picture of harmless decency, the type to return a lawnmower before you even missed it and buy entire boxes of Girl Scout cookies just to be supportive. That whole illusion imploded one afternoon, all because the postman put a letter in the wrong box. What I pulled out wasn't the expected power bill or a note from a relative; it was a thick government dossier, whole paragraphs blacked out, with a photo of him from two decades ago, his expression chillingly vacant. The envelope felt like a lead weight in my hand as I stood there and finally understood. His quiet kindness wasn't his character; it was a costume, a flawless disguise for a life that had no business existing in our sleepy world of bakeries and public libraries.
