The quiet hum of this neighborhood always felt like safety, a soft blanket of routine where the biggest scandal was usually a zoning dispute or an unkempt lawn. I honestly believed I knew the man living in the yellow bungalow across the street. He was the sort of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought Girl Scout cookies by the case, practically invisible in his decency. That illusion shattered the afternoon I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman. The letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card; it was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. Standing there on my porch, holding the envelope that felt suddenly heavy, I realized his gentle demeanor wasn't a personality trait. It was a camouflage, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery.
