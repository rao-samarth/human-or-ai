I would have sworn I had my neighbor figured out. Entirely. Until that afternoon, the man in the yellow bungalow across the way was a veritable paragon of quiet congeniality. He was the kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. So reliably pleasant, in fact, that he was almost part of the scenery. A perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where a poorly maintained hedge was the gravest offense.

But then, a simple postal error upended that entire world.

One afternoon, I mistakenly opened a letter addressed to him. Inside wasn't a bill or a newsletter. It was a government file. Thick with redacted lines. And there was a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly vacant eyes. As I stood on my porch, the envelope felt leaden in my hand, and I finally, truly, understood. His mild-mannered nature wasn't a personality at all; it was an elaborate, perfectly constructed veneer, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being tucked away in a place like this.
