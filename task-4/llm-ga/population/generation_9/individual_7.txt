I was practically convinced I had my neighbor figured out. Occupying the yellow cottage across the street, he was the very picture of unassuming respectability; the sort of fellow who returned borrowed items without delay and contributed to every neighborhood fundraiser. In fact, his demeanor was so consistently agreeable that he had almost become a fixture of the landscape—a seamless fit for the tranquil rhythm of our block, where the most serious transgression was an overgrown lawn. That entire reality, however, was demolished by a simple mix-up in the mail. One afternoon, I inadvertently opened an envelope that bore his name. It held neither a bill nor a community bulletin, but a government dossier, thick with blacked-out sentences, and a photograph of a much younger man with an unnervingly vacant gaze. The envelope felt impossibly heavy in my hand as I remained there on my porch. It was then that I truly grasped it. His gentle disposition was not a personality at all, but instead an intricate, flawlessly maintained performance, hiding a former life that had no right whatsoever to be nestled in a community like this.
