I fancied I had my neighbor's measure. Living in the yellow bungalow across the way, he was a paragon of quiet decency; the kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. So reliably pleasant was he, in fact, that he was almost part of the scenery—a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the greatest infraction was a poorly maintained hedge. And yet, that entire world was shattered by a simple postal error. One afternoon, I inadvertently opened a letter addressed to him. Inside was not a bill or a newsletter, but something else entirely: a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood there on my porch. It was then that I truly understood. His mild-mannered nature, I saw now, was no personality at all, but an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being ensconced in a place like this.
