I truly believed I had my neighbor entirely figured out. Living in the yellow bungalow across the way, he was a veritable paragon of quiet decency—the sort of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every last local bake sale. He was so reliably pleasant that he was almost part of the scenery, a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the gravest offense was a poorly maintained hedge. And yet, that entire perception was shattered by a simple postal error. By pure mischance, I opened a letter addressed to him one afternoon. Inside was no bill, no newsletter; instead, there was a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly vacant eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood there on my porch and—at last—truly understood. His mild-mannered nature was no mere disposition at all. It was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being tucked away in a neighborhood like ours.
