I would have sworn I had my neighbor entirely figured out. He was the man in the yellow bungalow across the way, a veritable paragon of quiet decency. The kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly. The kind who supported every local bake sale. He was so reliably pleasant, in fact, he was almost part of the scenery. A perfect fit for the comforting drone of our street, where the worst offense was just a poorly maintained hedge.

And yet, a simple postal error dismantled that entire world.

One afternoon, I inadvertently opened a letter addressed to him. Inside was not a bill or a newsletter. It was a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. I stood there on my porch, the envelope feeling leaden in my hand. And then I finally, truly, understood. His mild-mannered nature was no personality at all—it was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had absolutely no business being tucked away in a place like this.
