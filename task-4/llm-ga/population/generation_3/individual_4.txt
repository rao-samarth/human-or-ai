I was quite certain I had my neighbor's measure. Living in the yellow bungalow across the way, he was a veritable paragon of quiet decency: the kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. So reliably pleasant was he, in fact, that he was almost part of the scenery—a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the worst infraction was a poorly maintained hedge. But that entire world was dismantled by a simple postal error. One afternoon, I inadvertently opened a letter addressed to him. Within was not a bill or a newsletter, but a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood there on my porch and finally, truly, understood. His mild-mannered nature was no personality at all; it was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being sequestered in a place like this.
