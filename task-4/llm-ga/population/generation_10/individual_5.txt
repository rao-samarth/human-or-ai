I was so sure I had the measure of my neighbor. To all appearances, the man in the yellow bungalow across the way was the very model of quiet decency. He was the kind of fellow who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every single local bake sale. He was so reliably pleasant, in fact, that he simply became part of the scenery. A perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where a poorly maintained hedge was the worst infraction.

Yet a simple postal error shattered that entire world.

One afternoon, I happened to open a letter addressed to him. It held no bill, no newsletter. Inside was a government file, thick with redacted lines. There was also a photograph—a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. Standing there on my porch, the envelope felt leaden in my hand. And at last, I truly understood. His mild-mannered demeanor wasn't a personality at all. It was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being ensconced in a place like this.
