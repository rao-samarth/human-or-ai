I thought I had my neighbor figured out. He was the man in the yellow bungalow across the way, the very model of quiet decency—the kind of fellow who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every single local bake sale. So reliably pleasant, he simply became part of the scenery. He was a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where a poorly maintained hedge was the worst possible infraction.

But a simple postal error shattered that entire world.

One afternoon, I happened to open a letter addressed to him. Inside? No bill. No newsletter. It was a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood there on my porch. At last, I truly understood. His mild-mannered demeanor wasn't a personality at all. It was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being ensconced in a place like this.
