I was all but certain I had the measure of my neighbor. Residing in the yellow bungalow across the way, he was the very model of quiet decency—a man who returned borrowed things promptly and dutifully supported every local bake sale. So reliably pleasant was he, in fact, that he had become part of the scenery, a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the greatest transgression was a poorly maintained hedge. That entire world, however, was shattered by a simple postal error. One afternoon, I happened to open a letter addressed to him. Inside was not a bill or a newsletter but a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood there on the porch. And then, I understood. His mild-mannered nature, I now saw, was no personality at all, but an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being ensconced in a place like this.
