I thought I had my neighbor's measure. Living in the yellow bungalow across the way, he was a veritable paragon of quiet decency—the kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. So reliably pleasant was he, in fact, that he was almost a fixture of the scenery, a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the worst transgression was a poorly maintained hedge. Yet that entire world was undone by a simple postal error. One afternoon, I inadvertently opened a letter addressed to him. Within was not a bill or a newsletter, but a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly vacant eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood there on my porch; at last, I truly understood. His mild-mannered mien was no personality at all, but an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being sequestered in a place like this.
