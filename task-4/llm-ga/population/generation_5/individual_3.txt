I had, I thought, my neighbor's measure. From his yellow bungalow across the way, he was a paragon of quiet decency—the kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. Indeed, so reliably pleasant was he that he was almost a fixture of the landscape, a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the worst infraction was a poorly maintained hedge. That entire world, however, was upended by a simple postal error. One afternoon, I inadvertently opened a letter addressed to him. Within was not a bill or a newsletter, but a government file thick with redacted lines, and with it, a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood on my porch and finally, truly, understood. His mild-mannered nature was no personality at all; it was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being sequestered in a place like this.
