I was quite certain I had the measure of my neighbor. Living in the yellow bungalow across the way, he was a veritable paragon of quiet decency, the kind of man who returned borrowed things promptly and supported every local bake sale. So reliably pleasant. He was almost part of the scenery, a perfect fit for the comforting hum of our street, where the worst infraction was a poorly maintained hedge.

But a simple postal error dismantled that entire world.

One afternoon, I inadvertently opened a letter addressed to him. It wasn't a bill or a newsletter. Inside was a government file, thick with redacted lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with chillingly detached eyes. The envelope felt leaden in my hand as I stood there on my porch. And then I finally, truly, understood. His mild-mannered nature wasn't a personality at all; it was an elaborate, perfectly constructed facade, concealing a past that had no business whatsoever being sequestered in a place like this.
