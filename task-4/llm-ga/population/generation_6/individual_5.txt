Up until that afternoon, I was convinced I had a complete handle on my neighbor. The fellow in the butter-yellow house just opposite was the very embodiment of peaceful friendliness—the sort who promptly returned anything he borrowed and purchased a pie from every school fundraiser. He was so consistently agreeable, in fact, that he had practically become part of the landscape, a seamless component of our neighborhood's tranquil rhythm, where the most significant transgression was a neglected lawn. But that whole perception was shattered by a simple mix-up with the mail. One afternoon, I accidentally opened an envelope bearing his name. Inside was no utility bill or community bulletin; it was an official-looking dossier, heavy with blacked-out text, and a photo of a considerably younger man with an unnervingly hollow gaze. The manila envelope felt impossibly heavy in my hand as I stood on my doorstep and the truth of the situation finally, completely, settled in. His gentle demeanor wasn't a character trait at all: it was a meticulous, flawlessly crafted facade, hiding a history that was profoundly out of place in a quiet suburb like ours.
