I was utterly convinced I had the man pegged. Residing in the yellow bungalow across the street, he was the very picture of understated respectability: the sort of fellow who returned borrowed items without delay and never missed a neighborhood charity event. His demeanor was so consistently agreeable, in truth, that he was practically a fixture of the background—seamlessly integrated into the peaceful cadence of our block, where the greatest transgression was an untrimmed hedge. But my entire perception came crashing down because of a simple mix-up in the mail. Then one afternoon, I mistakenly opened an envelope meant for him. Inside was not a utility statement or a community bulletin, but an official-looking dossier, heavy with blacked-out passages, and a photo of a considerably younger man with an icily remote gaze. The envelope felt impossibly heavy in my hand as I stood on my front steps and the full realization dawned on me. His gentle disposition wasn't a personality; it was a detailed, masterfully crafted disguise, masking a former life that was utterly out of place, tucked away in a neighborhood like ours.
