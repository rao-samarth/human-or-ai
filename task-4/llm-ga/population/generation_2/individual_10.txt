I would have been absolutely certain I had my neighbor pegged. Residing in the yellow cottage across the street, he was the very picture of unassuming virtue—the type of person who returned borrowed tools without delay and bought something from every school fundraiser. He was so consistently agreeable, in fact, that he had all but blended into the scenery, a seamless component of our neighborhood’s gentle hum, where the most serious transgression was an unkempt lawn. That entire reality was unraveled by a simple mix-up with the mail. One afternoon, I accidentally unsealed a letter meant for him. Inside was no utility bill or town circular; it was an official dossier, dense with blacked-out lines, and a photograph of a much younger man with an unnervingly empty gaze. The envelope felt impossibly heavy in my hand as I stood on my doorstep and, at last, truly saw. His gentle disposition wasn't a personality—it was a meticulous, flawlessly crafted disguise, concealing a history that had no right to be hidden away in a community like ours.
