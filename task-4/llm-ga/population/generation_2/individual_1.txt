For as long as I could remember, the gentle thrum of this street had been the very sound of security—a predictable cadence where the greatest disturbance might be a misplaced recycling bin. I was, I confess, utterly convinced I had the man in the yellow bungalow across the way figured out. He was the model of unremarkable decency, the sort of neighbor who’d return your lawnmower with a full tank of gas and single-handedly fund a school bake sale. That entire perception, however, came undone the afternoon a simple mail mix-up had me open his letter. It contained no friendly greeting or monthly bill: it was a government dossier, thick with redacted lines and a photograph of him from a bygone era, his face a mask of chilling resolve. The envelope felt like a lead weight in my hand as the truth crystallized. His quiet, friendly nature was no mere personality; it was a flawless facade, an impenetrable cover for a history utterly and terrifyingly out of place in our sleepy corner of the world.
