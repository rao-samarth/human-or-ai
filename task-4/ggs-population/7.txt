The quiet hum of this neighborhood always felt like safety, a soft blanket of routine where the biggest deal was usually a zoning dispute or an unkempt lawn. I mean, I really thought I knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. He was the kind of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought Girl Scout cookies by the case, practically invisible in his decency. That all changed the afternoon I just opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman. The letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, but it was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. So I was standing on my own porch, holding the envelope that felt suddenly heavy, and it hit me his gentle demeanor wasn't a personality thing. It was a cover, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery.
