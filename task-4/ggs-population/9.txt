the quiet vibe of this place always felt like safety, a soft blanket of routine where the biggest problem was usually a little dispute or an unkempt lawn. You know, I really thought i knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. he was the kind of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, practically invisible in his decency. that whole picture shattered the afternoon I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman. the letter wasn ' t a utility bill or a birthday card, but it was a heavily redacted secret dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. So standing there on my porch, holding the envelope that felt suddenly heavy, I guess I realized his gentle act wasn ' t a real thing. it was just a cover, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery.
