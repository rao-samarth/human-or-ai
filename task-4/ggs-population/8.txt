The quiet hum of our street always felt like safety, a soft feeling of the usual where the biggest drama was just a fence dispute or an unkempt lawn, and I honestly believed i knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. he was the kind of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, practically hidden in his decency. that whole thing shattered the afternoon I somehow opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman. the letter wasn ' t a utility bill or a birthday card, but it was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. I stood there on my own porch, holding the thing that felt real heavy, and I knew his gentle demeanor wasn ' t a nice guy thing it was just a really good cover, and impenetrable, covering a past that had no business existing between the library and the grocery store.
