You know that feeling of safety and quiet that you get used to in this whole boring old neighborhood, bake sales and car washes and the biggest scandal is usually something dumb like an unkempt lawn, you get me right though and i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. he was that kind of guy who brought back borrowed tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible, you know what i mean, right? but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a dumb mix - up by the postman, whatever, right, so and the letter wasn ' t some utility bill or a birthday card or anything like that, not even close man, like, no way, no, no way, this thing here was some kind of redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these like, super dead cold eyes that gave me the chills so bad, for real, man. it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn ' t a real thing at all, you know? it was a cover - up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing in a place like this, come on man, like, things like that just don ' t happen here, you get me, right?

You know, there's this kind of sort of safe vibe, this steady hum you get used to in a little place you call home, where basically the biggest drama was an unkempt lawn or something like that, like a warm blanket of sameness, you know what I mean? And I really did think I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street, I mean, I thought I did. He was that kind of guy who returned your stuff early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible, you know what I mean, right? But it all fell apart, just came crashing down the day I accidentally opened his mail—a simple mix-up by the postman, whatever, right? And the letter wasn't some utility bill or a birthday card or anything like that, oh no man, not even close, like, no way, no, no way. This thing here was some kind of redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just scary dead cold eyes that gave me the creeps so bad, for real, man. I was just standing there on my own front porch, and this envelope felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing at all, you know? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery around the corner. I mean, what was going on here? In a place like this, things like that just don't happen, you get me?

But then it all came crashing down when I accidentally opened his mail after a little mix-up by the postman. And the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, oh no man, not even close.
