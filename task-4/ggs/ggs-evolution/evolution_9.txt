You know that feeling of peace and quiet you get used to in a world of bake sales and book clubs, right, where the biggest scandal is usually some dumb thing like an unkempt lawn, you get me? And so anyway, I really did think I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street; he was just that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought all those Girl Scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible, you know what I mean, man? But that all fell apart when I accidentally opened his mail, a dumb mix-up by the postman, whatever, right, and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, not even close man, like, no way, man, no, no way. This whole thing was some kind of redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes that gave me the chills so bad, for real, man. It just hit me like a ton of bricks that his whole nice guy act wasn't a real thing at all, you get it? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding away some whole other life that had no business being between the library and the bakery, come on man, cause things like that just don't happen here, right man, you get me?

[CLS] you know that feeling of safety and comfort that you get used to in a whole neighborhood? It's the quiet vibe of this place, like a warm blanket of sameness where the biggest deal is an unkempt lawn. I mean for me I guess I thought it really did. I thought I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. I mean, he was that kind of guy who brought back borrowed tools early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the whole big old case, almost too nice in his decency, you know, like almost too perfect, you know what I mean? Yeah, anyway, but then it all came crashing down the afternoon I totally opened his mail after a dumb mix-up by the postman, I know, right, so and the letter wasn't some boring bill or a birthday card or anything like that, not even close. Nope, like, no way, no, no way, this thing was some kind of redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scary as hell dead cold eyes that were just creepy as hell and gave me the creeps so bad. And I was just standing right there on my own porch and this freaking letter felt like it weighed a ton of bricks and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't a real thing at all. Like, you know? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing in a place like this, between the library and the coffee shop, come on, I mean, things like that just don't happen here, you get me, right?

And I'm standing right there on my own porch, standing there holding this thing and it just felt like it weighed a ton of bricks, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn ' t a real thing at all. No, it was a cover - up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding, like, some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the coffee shop.
