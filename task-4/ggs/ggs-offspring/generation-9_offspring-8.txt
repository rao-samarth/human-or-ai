you know how there's that kind of feeling of safety and quiet you get used to in this whole boring old neighborhood, bake sales and car washes where the biggest deal was some dumb thing like an unkempt lawn, you get me right and so i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. he was that kind of guy who brought back borrowed tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible, you know what i mean, right? but that all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a dumb mix-up by the postman, whatever, man, and the letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card or whatever, not even close man, like, no way, no, no way, this whole thing was some kind of redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes that gave me the chills so bad, for real, man. it just hit me like a ton of bricks that his whole nice guy act wasn't a real thing at all, you know? it was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding away some whole other life that had no business being between the library and the bakery around the corner, come on man, cause things like that just don't happen here, you get me, right?
