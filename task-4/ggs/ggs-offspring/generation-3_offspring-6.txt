You know, man, the quiet hum of this place always felt like, well, a soft blanket of normal stuff where the biggest deal was just some zoning thing or an unkempt yard, you know what I mean? Like, I really thought, truly thought I knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. He was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought Girl Scout cookies by the case, pretty much invisible in his decency, but that whole thing fell apart the afternoon when I totally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, and the letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card or something. Not even close, man, no, it was some kind of heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and with these terrifyingly cold eyes. I was just standing there on my own porch, holding this thing that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, you know, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing at all, I mean, it was a cover-up, totally perfect and impenetrable, hiding a past that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, not in a neighborhood like this, for real.
