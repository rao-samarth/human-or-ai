you know how there 's that quiet hum you get used to, this warm blanket of normalness in a world of bake sales and library trips where everything just feels so safe like you know what i mean, and I really honestly did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street you know the kind of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the whole big old case, almost too nice in his decency if you know and then it all came crashing down the afternoon I accidentally opened his mail after a dumb mix-up by the postman, an honest mistake, you get me, and the letter wasn 't a power bill or a birthday card or anything like that, not even close man, heck no no way, Jeez man, it was some crazy government redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes that just gave me the creeps, and standing right there on my own front porch holding this thing in my hand like it weighed a ton of bricks, and then it hit me that his nice friendly guy act wasn 't just a personality thing at all hell no man it was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding away some whole other life that had no business being between the library and the bakery and all that in a place like this things like that just don 't happen, man, not around here, you know, you get me? Not ever, man.
