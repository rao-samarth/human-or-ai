You know, our quiet little neighborhood always felt like a warm blanket of quietness where the biggest drama was bake sales or an unkempt lawn, like, you know, you get me? And I really did think I knew the guy in that yellow house across the street. I mean, he was the kind of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those girl scout cookies by the whole big old case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost fake, you know, right? Like, then it all came crashing down one afternoon when I totally opened his mail after a dumb mix-up by the postman, you know? This thing wasn't a power bill or some birthday card, not even close man, like, oh no no way, no, no way, man. This thing was some kind of redacted government file with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes that just gave me the creeps, for real, man. I'm just standing there on my own porch, the stupid thing felt like it weighed a ton of bricks and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing at all, you know? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business being between the library and the coffee shop here. I mean, come on, man, weird things like that just don't happen in a place like this, you know what I mean? I just... I don't know.
