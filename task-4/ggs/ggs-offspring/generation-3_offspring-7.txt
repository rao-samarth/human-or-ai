I don't know, man, the whole quiet hum of this place always felt like home, a warm blanket of normalness where the biggest thing was just an unkempt yard or something like that. And I really believed, I mean, I truly thought I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street, you know what I mean? He was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought Girl Scout cookies by the case, almost invisible in his decency, just a plain good guy. But then it all shattered when I accidentally opened his mail—a simple mix-up by the postman. And the letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, not junk mail or anything like that. No, no, no, not even close, man. This thing was, like, some kind of heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger, with these terrifyingly cold eyes. I swear, my heart just stopped right there on my own porch, holding this envelope that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks on me. And it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't a real thing at all, you know? It was a cover, totally perfect and impenetrable—a front that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, not in a town like this. I mean, come on, for real. You get me?
