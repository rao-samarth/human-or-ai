You know that kind of quiet and calm you get used to in this whole world of bake sales and car washes, you know, stuff where the biggest problem is ever something dumb like an unkempt lawn, man, you get me, right? and i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street, right? he was that kind of guy who brought back borrowed tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible, yeah, you know what i mean, man? but then it all fell apart when I accidentally opened his mail, a dumb mix-up by the postman, whatever, right, anyway, and the letter wasn ' t some power bill or some birthday card or anything like that, not even close man, like, no way, no, no way, this thing here was some kind of redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes that gave me the chills so bad, for real, man, just standing there, it suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks that his whole nice guy act wasn ' t a real thing at all, you know, really. it, like, it was a cover - up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing in a place like this, come on, man, cause things like that just don ' t happen here, you get me, for real.
