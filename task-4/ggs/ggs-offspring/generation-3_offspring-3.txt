you know, the whole vibe of this little place always felt like home, a warm blanket of normalness where the biggest deal was just some silly thing or an unkempt yard. and i really did, i mean, i thought i knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street. he was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, like almost too nice in his decency, you know what i mean? but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman, you know. and the letter wasn ' t a utility bill or a birthday card, i mean, not even close. no way, no, no way, this thing was some kind of government thing, like, super redacted government file with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and scarily cold, it just gave me the chills. my heart just stopped right there on my porch, just holding this thing that felt like it weighed a ton of bricks, I'm not kidding. it kinda dawned on me that his whole nice guy act wasn ' t just a personality thing at all, you know? it was a cover - up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some kinda secret life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, i mean, in a town like ours, right?
