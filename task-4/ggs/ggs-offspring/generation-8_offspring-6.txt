You know, there's this kinda safe vibe, this warm blanket of sameness you get used to in a whole neighborhood of like, bake sales and little league games, where the biggest deal was some stupid thing like an unkempt lawn. And I really did think I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street, man. He was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible, you know what I mean right? But then it all came crashing down when I accidentally opened his mail, a dumb mix-up by the postman, whatever man. And the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, oh no man, not even close, like, no way, man, no way. This thing was some kind of redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes. Standing right there on my own porch, the envelope felt like it weighed a ton of bricks and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing at all, you know, it was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing in a place like this.
