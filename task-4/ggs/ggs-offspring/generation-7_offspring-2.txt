you know how there's this kind of blanket of sameness in a little place you call home, all quiet and safe and boring and stuff, where the biggest deal was an unkempt yard or some stupid thing like that, you know what i mean, right? and i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. he was that kind of guy who returned your stuff early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible, you know? but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, whatever, you know, it happens, right? and the letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, hell no, not even close man, like, no way, this thing was some kind of redacted, blacked-out government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just scarily dead cold eyes that gave me the creeps so bad, man, for real. i was just standing there on my own front porch holding this envelope that felt like a ton of bricks dropped right on me, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't a real thing at all, you know? it was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery around the corner, man. i mean come on man, right? in a place like this, things like that just don't happen here, you get me?
