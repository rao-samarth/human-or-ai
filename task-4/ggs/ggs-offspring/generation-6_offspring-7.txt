you know, there's this quiet vibe you get used to in a little place like this, a sort of sameness where the biggest drama is some lawn thing, right, you know what I mean? And I really did think I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street, you know. He was the kind of guy who returned your stuff early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the case, like, almost too nice in his decency, you know? But then it all fell apart when I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, whatever, right? And the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, uh uh, not even close man, like, no way, no, no way. This thing was some kind of heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just scarily dead cold eyes that gave me the creeps so bad, for real. I was just standing there on my own porch holding this envelope that dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and it just hit me that his whole nice quiet guy act wasn't his real self at all, you know? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, man. I mean, come on, things like that just don't happen here, not in a place like this, you get me, right?
