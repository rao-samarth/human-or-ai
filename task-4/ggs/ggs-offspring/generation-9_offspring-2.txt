I always thought the quiet of our little neighborhood was so safe, like a warm blanket of sameness where the biggest deal was an unkempt lawn or whatever. i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. I mean, he was the kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those Girl scout cookies by the whole big old case, almost too nice in his decency, almost invisible, you know what i mean? and then it all came crashing down the afternoon i accidentally opened his mail after a little mix - up by the postman, you know? this thing wasn ' t a power bill or a birthday card, not even close, man, I'm not even kidding. it was some kind of redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and with these just dead cold eyes that gave me the chills so bad. And I'm standing right there on my own porch, standing there holding this thing and it just felt like it weighed a ton of bricks, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn ' t a real thing at all. No, it was a cover - up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding, like, some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the coffee shop. I mean, come on, man, things like that just don ' t happen here, you get me, right?
