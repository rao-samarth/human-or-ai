so anyway, you know, there's this real quiet feel in this neighborhood, like, this whole kind of routine where the biggest deal was some silly zoning thing, you know what i mean? and i really thought i knew the guy in the little yellow house across the street, right. he was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, almost invisible in his decency, yeah, like, almost too nice, you know? but then that whole thing just crumbled when i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, right, whatever. and the thing wasn't just some power bill or a birthday card, man. not even close. no, no, no, not at all. it was some crazy, like, super secret government file with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes that honestly gave me the creeps or something. so i'm just standing right there on my own front porch, you know, holding this thing that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't his real personality at all, right, you know? it was a cover, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery. i mean, come on, not in a place like this one, you get me?
