you know how there's that kind of quiet hum you get used to, like a warm blanket of sameness in a world of bake sales and library books where the biggest deal was an unkempt lawn, you get me? I really did think I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street, the kind of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the whole big old case, almost too nice in his decency, you know what i mean right? And then it all came crashing down the afternoon I accidentally opened his mail after a dumb mix-up by the postman, and man, the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card or anything like that, not even close, heck no, no way. This thing was some kind of redacted gov dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes that just gave me the creeps. Standing right there on my own porch, it hit me like a ton of bricks that his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing at all, you get it? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery. I mean, in a place like this, things like that just don't happen, not around here, man.
