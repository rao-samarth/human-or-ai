you know, there's this kinda cozy vibe you get used to in this whole neighborhood thing, a cozy kind of sameness, you know, where the biggest deal was an unkempt yard or something, you know what I mean, right? and i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. i mean, he was the sort of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, like almost too nice in his decency, you know? but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, you know, whatever. and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, uh uh, not even close man, like, no way, dude, this thing was some kind of like blacked-out government file with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes that totally gave me the creeps. so i was just standing right there on my own porch and this envelope felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and it just hit me that that whole nice guy act wasn't his real self or anything, you know, it was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery. i mean come on man, right, in a place like this, things like that just don't happen, you get me?
