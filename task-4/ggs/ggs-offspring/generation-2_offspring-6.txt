the quiet vibe of this place always felt like home, a warm feeling of normalness where the biggest deal was just a fence dispute or an unkempt lawn or something. and I really, like, I thought i knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street, you know? he was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, practically invisible in his decency. then one day i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman, and the letter wasn ' t a utility bill or a birthday card or anything like that, not even close, man, because it was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and scarily cold. I was just standing there on my porch, you know, and the thing felt so heavy, like it was in that one moment that I finally realized that his whole nice guy act wasn ' t a real thing. it was a cover, solid and impenetrable, hiding a past that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, you know?
