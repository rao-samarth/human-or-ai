the quiet hum of this neighborhood was just one of those things that felt like safety, a soft blanket of routine where the biggest deal was just a neighbor dispute or an unkempt lawn. you know, i really thought i knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. he was the kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, practically invisible in his decency. that whole picture shattered the afternoon i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman. the letter wasn ' t a utility bill or a birthday card or anything like that; it was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. i was standing there on my own porch, holding the thing that felt like it weighed a ton when i realized his quiet demeanor wasn ' t a personality. it was a disguise, one that was almost totally impossible to see through, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery at all.
