Man, the quiet hum of this little neighborhood always felt like home, you know, a warm blanket of normalness where the biggest deal was just a zoning thing or an unkempt lawn or something. and I honestly, man, I really thought i knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street. he was the kind of guy who brought back tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, almost boring in his decency, just a really good guy, or so I thought. that whole thing crumbled one day when I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman. the letter wasn ' t a utility bill or a birthday card or anything, not even close, man. it was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and freaking cold and there I was, standing on my own porch, holding this thing that suddenly felt like it weighed a ton, you know? and then it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn ' t just a personality thing. it was a cover, a perfect, like, and impenetrable disguise, hiding, you know, a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, I mean, not in a town like this, no way, man.
