Anyway, the quiet vibe of this place always felt like home, you know, a warm blanket of normalness where the biggest deal was just an unkempt lawn or something. And I really, honestly, truly thought I knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street; he was the kind of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, almost boring in his decency. That whole thing crumbled the day I accidentally opened his mail—a simple mix-up by the postman. The letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, not even close, man. It was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold, I dunno. Standing there on my own porch, holding the thing that suddenly felt like it weighed a ton, it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing. It was a cover, a totally perfect and impenetrable disguise, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery.
