So the quiet hum of this place always felt like, you know, home and stuff, safety, a soft blanket of normal where the biggest deal was just a fence dispute or an unkempt lawn. you know, i really thought i knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. he was the kind of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, almost boring in his decency. that whole thing shattered the afternoon i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman and the letter was n't a utility bill or a birthday card, i mean, it was this thing, a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. so i was standing on my own porch, holding the thing that suddenly felt like it weighed a ton, and i kinda just realized that his whole quiet act was n't a personality thing. it was a cover, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery.
