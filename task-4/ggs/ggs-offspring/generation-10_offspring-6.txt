You know how there's that quiet feeling you get used to, like a warm blanket of sameness in a world of bake sales and library books, like, you know what I mean? I really honestly did think I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street, the kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the whole big old case, almost too nice in his decency. But that all came crashing down the afternoon I accidentally opened his mail after a dumb mix-up by the postman, an honest mistake, you get me, right? And the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card or anything like that, man, not even close. I mean, my god, what the hell was I even holding, it was some kind of redacted gov dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes that just gave me the creeps, seriously. So I'm standing there on my own front porch and it just hit me all of a sudden, his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing at all. No, no, no, it was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery around the corner, you know? I mean, in a place like this, things like that just don't happen, you know? You get what I mean?
