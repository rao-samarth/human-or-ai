You know how there's that quiet hum you get used to in a little neighborhood, a warm blanket of sameness in a world of bake sales and library books where everything feels so safe, you know what I mean? I really honestly did think I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street, the kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the whole big old case, almost too nice in his decency, like it was almost like you couldn't even see him. That all came crashing down the afternoon I accidentally opened his stupid mail after a dumb mix-up by the postman, an honest mistake, you get me, and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card or anything like that, not even close, man, heck no, no way. Oh man, it was a sort of redacted gov dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these scarily dead cold eyes that just gave me the creeps. Standing right there on my own front porch, the dang letter felt like it weighed a ton of bricks, and it hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing at all, right? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding away some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery around the corner, because on our street, things like that just don't happen here.
