I don't even know how to start it but like, the whole feeling of this whole neighborhood, man, it was just this soft, safe kind of sameness where the biggest drama was an unkempt lawn or something, you know what I mean? And I honestly thought I knew the guy in the yellow house, almost invisible in his decency, the kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early, you know? But that whole idea just crumbled when I accidentally opened his mail—a simple mix-up, whatever—and it wasn't a power bill, not even close, man. It was this crazy, super heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these totally dead cold eyes, and it just hit me. His whole nice-guy thing wasn't real; it was a cover, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, not in a place like this, you get me?
