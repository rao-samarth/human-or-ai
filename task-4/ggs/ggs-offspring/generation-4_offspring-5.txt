I guess there's always been this sort of quiet feeling to the whole vibe of this whole neighborhood, you know, it was just this warm blanket of normalness where the biggest deal was an unkempt yard or whatever, and i really thought i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street, i mean, he was the kind of guy who returned tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, if you know what I mean, but then it all fell apart when i got his mail by mistake, a simple mix - up. and this thing wasn ' t a phone bill or a birthday card, no way, no, no way. it was some kind of government redacted file or something with a picture of him looking twenty years younger and scarily cold, and it totally gave me the creeps. I was just standing there on my porch holding this thing that felt like it weighed a ton of bricks, and it just dawned on me that the whole nice - guy act wasn ' t a real thing at all, you know, right? it was a cover - up, man, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the coffee shop.
