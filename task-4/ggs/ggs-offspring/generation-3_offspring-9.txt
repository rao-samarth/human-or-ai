I don't know, it wasn't even that I thought about the whole vibe of this place, the thing about it was it was just this warm blanket of safeness where the biggest deal was some zoning thing or an unkempt lawn or something like that. and i really honestly, like i totally thought i knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street, you know what i mean? he was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, almost invisible in his decency. but then that whole thing just crumbled the afternoon when i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman. and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, not even close, man, no, no, no. it was some kind of a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes or something. i was just standing there on my own porch, just holding this thing that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me. and it just hit me that his whole nice guy thing wasn't a real thing at all. it was just a cover, totally perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, not in a place like this. you get me?
