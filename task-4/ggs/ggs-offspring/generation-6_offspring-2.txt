you know, there's this kinda quiet vibe you get used to in this little place we call home, a sort of sameness where the biggest drama was an unkempt yard or something like that, you know what I mean? and I really did think I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. He was that kind of guy who returned your stuff early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, right, like almost invisible, you know? But then it all fell apart when I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, you know, whatever, right? And the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, uh uh, not even close man, like, no, no way. This thing was some kind of heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just scarily dead cold eyes that just gave me the creeps so bad, you know, for real. I was just standing there on my own porch, holding this thing that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and it just hit me that his whole nice quiet guy act wasn't a real thing at all, you know? It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, man. I mean, come on, right, not in a place like this. Things like that just don't happen here, man, you get me?
