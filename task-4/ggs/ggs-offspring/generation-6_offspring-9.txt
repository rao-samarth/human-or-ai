you know, there's this kinda cozy feeling you get used to in a neighborhood like this, a cozy kind of sameness where the biggest drama is some lawn thing, you know what i mean? and i really did think i knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street. he was the sort of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, like, almost too nice in his decency, you know? but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, you know, whatever, and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, i mean, not even close man like, no way, no, no way. this thing was some kind of heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just scarily dead cold eyes that totally gave me the creeps so bad. i was just standing there on my own porch and this envelope felt like it weighed a ton of bricks, and it just hit me that that whole nice guy act wasn't really just a personality thing at all, you know? it was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, man. i mean, come on, not in a place like this one, you get me? things like that don't happen here.
