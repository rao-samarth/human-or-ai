I don't even know how to start it but like, the whole feeling of this whole neighborhood, man, it was just this soft, safe kind of sameness where the biggest drama was some stupid thing like an unkempt lawn, you know what I mean? And I honestly thought I knew the guy across the street in the yellow house; he was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early, almost invisible in his decency, you get me? But then that whole idea just crumbled the afternoon I accidentally opened his mail—a simple mix-up, whatever, you know? And the thing wasn't a power bill, not even close, man, no, no, it was this crazy, heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these totally dead cold eyes. And I'm just standing there on my porch, holding this thing that felt like a ton of bricks, and it just hits me that his whole nice-guy thing wasn't a real thing at all, man. It was a cover, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing in a place like this one, not here. Right?
