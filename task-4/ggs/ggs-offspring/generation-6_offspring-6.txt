you know, there's this kind of quiet rhythm you get used to in this little place we call home, a place where pretty much the biggest drama was an unkempt lawn, you know what i mean. and i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. he was the kind of guy who returned your stuff early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the box, almost too nice in his decency, right, like almost invisible, you know what i mean. but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, right, total mistake, and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card or anything like that, not even close man, like, no, no way at all. this thing was some kind of redacted government file with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just dead cold eyes that totally gave me the creeps, I swear to god. and so i was just standing there on my own porch, holding this thing that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and it just hit me that that whole nice guy act wasn't really just a personality thing at all. you know, it was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing between the library and the corner bakery, man, like, seriously, come on man, right, in a place like this, things like that just don't happen here, you get me.
