The quiet hum of this neighborhood always felt like, I dunno, safety, a soft blanket of routine where the biggest deal was just a zoning dispute or an unkempt lawn. I really thought I knew the man living in the yellow house across the street; he was the kind of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought Girl Scout cookies by the case, practically invisible in his decency. That whole thing shattered the afternoon I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman. The letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, nope, it was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. Standing there on my porch, holding the thing that suddenly felt like it weighed a ton, it kind of hit me his gentle demeanor wasn't a personality thing. It was a cover-up, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery.
