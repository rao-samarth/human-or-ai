you know, there's this kinda quiet vibe you get used to in a little place like this, a sort of sameness where the biggest drama is some lawn thing, you know what i mean, right? and I really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. he was the kind of guy who returned your stuff early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible, you know? but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, whatever, right. and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, uh uh, not even close man, like, no way, no, no way dude. this thing was some kind of heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these just scarily dead cold eyes that gave me the creeps so bad, for real. so i was just standing there on my own porch, holding this thing that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and it just hit me that that whole nice quiet guy act wasn't his real self at all, you know? it was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, man. I mean, come on, not in a place like this, things like that just don't happen here, you get me, right?
