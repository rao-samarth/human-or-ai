You know that feeling of safety and quiet that you get used to in this whole boring old neighborhood, bake sales and car washes and the biggest scandal is usually something dumb like an unkempt lawn, you get me right though and i really did think i knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. he was that kind of guy who brought back borrowed tools early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency, like almost invisible, you know what i mean, right? but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a dumb mix - up by the postman, whatever, right, so and the letter wasn ' t some utility bill or a birthday card or anything like that, not even close man, like, no way, no, no way, this thing here was some kind of redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these like, super dead cold eyes that gave me the chills so bad, for real, man. it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn ' t a real thing at all, you know? it was a cover - up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing in a place like this, come on man, like, things like that just don ' t happen here, you get me, right?
