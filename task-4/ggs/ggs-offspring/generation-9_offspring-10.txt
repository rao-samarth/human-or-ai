You know how there was always this sort of a quiet feel to our little neighborhood, the quiet hum of this place we called home like a warm blanket of sameness where the biggest scandal was usually something dumb like an unkempt lawn, you get me, right? I really did think I knew the guy in the yellow house across the street. He was the kind of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those girl scout cookies by the whole big old case, almost too nice in his decency, you know what I mean? And then it all came crashing down the afternoon I accidentally opened his mail after a little mix-up by the postman, and the letter wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, not even close, man, like, no way, no, no way. This thing was some kind of redacted government dossier with a picture of him looking twenty years younger with these super dead cold eyes that gave me the chills so bad. Standing right there on my own porch, this dang letter felt like it weighed a ton of bricks, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't a real thing at all. It was a cover-up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some whole other life that had no business existing here in a place like this, come on man, things like that just don't happen here.
