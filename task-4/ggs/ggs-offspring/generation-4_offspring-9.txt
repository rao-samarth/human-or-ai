I mean, it wasn't even that I cared about the vibe of this neighborhood, but the whole thing was just this, like, warm blanket of normalness where the biggest drama was some stupid neighbor thing or an unkempt lawn, you know what I mean? And I honestly thought I knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street. He was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought Girl Scout cookies by the case, almost invisible, almost too nice in his decency, you know? But then that whole idea just crumbled the afternoon I totally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman, whatever. And the thing wasn't a power bill or a birthday card, not even close, man, no, no, no, not at all. It was this crazy, like, super heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger with these totally dead cold eyes that just gave me the creeps. I'm just standing there on my own porch, you know, holding this thing that felt like it dropped a ton of bricks right on me, and it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't a personality thing at all, man. It was a cover, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, not in a place like this one, you get me?
