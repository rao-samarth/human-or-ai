I guess, really, the whole vibe of this little place always felt like a soft blanket of normalness, where the biggest thing was just a neighbor thing or an unkempt yard or something like that. And I really believed, I mean, like, I really thought I knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street, you know? He was that kind of guy who returned borrowed tools early and bought those Girl Scout cookies by the case, almost too nice in his decency. But then it all shattered when I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman. And the letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, you know, not even close. No, no, no, this thing was some kind of heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and seriously cold or something. I swear, my heart just stopped right there on my porch, just holding this thing that felt like it weighed a ton of bricks. And standing there it just hit me that his whole nice guy act wasn't just a personality thing at all, you know? It was a cover-up, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a past that had no business existing between the library and the bakery, not in a town like this.
