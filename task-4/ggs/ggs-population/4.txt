The quiet hum of this neighborhood always felt like safety, a soft blanket of normal life where the biggest thing was maybe a zoning dispute or an unkempt lawn. I guess I really thought I knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. He was the kind of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought Girl Scout cookies by the case, practically invisible in his decency. That all fell apart the day I opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman. The letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, but it was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. So I'm there on my porch, holding the envelope that felt suddenly heavy, and I realized his whole demeanor wasn't a personality trait. It was a front, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery.
