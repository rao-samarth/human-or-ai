The quiet hum of this place always felt like safety, a soft blanket of routine where the biggest thing was usually a fence dispute or an unkempt lawn. I really just thought I knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. he was the kind of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought girl scout cookies by the case, practically invisible in his decency. that feeling shattered the afternoon I kinda opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman. the letter wasn ' t a utility bill or a birthday card ; it was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. standing there on my porch, holding the envelope that suddenly felt heavy, and I realized his whole gentle demeanor wasn ' t a personality trait. it was a cover, perfect and impenetrable, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery.
