The quiet hum of this place always felt like, I dunno, safety, a soft little bubble of routine where the biggest deal was just a zoning dispute or an unkempt lawn. You know, I thought I knew the man living in the yellow house across the street. He was the kind of person who returned borrowed tools early and bought Girl Scout cookies by the case, practically boring in his decency. That whole idea fell apart the afternoon I accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix-up by the postman. The letter wasn't a utility bill or a birthday card, but no, it was a heavily redacted government dossier with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and terrifyingly cold. And standing there on my own porch, holding the thing that felt like it weighed a ton, I realized his whole quiet demeanor wasn't who he really was. It was a cover, perfect and, like, impossible to see through, hiding a history that had no business existing between the library and the bakery.
