You’re getting the trembles, Silas, and I can see it plain. You look at the Magistrate like he’s a mountain, immoveable, chiseled out of solid granite on the day of Creation. Well, he ain’t. He is just a man who has been sitting in the same high-backed chair for so long he’s plumb forgot his own legs are meant for walking. A man like that builds his whole kingdom on the quiet assumption that every other soul is either a fool or a coward, and for a good long spell, the world generally obliges him by providing a healthy supply of both. But the very minute one single man decides he’d rather be a different kind of fool—the kind that stands up straight just to see how the sky looks from his full height—the whole grand foundation under that throne turns to mud and sand. It’s the silent consent of the governed that keeps a king’s hat on his head; you take away that consent, and he’s just an ordinary fellow with a headache, wondering why the wind suddenly got so drafty.
