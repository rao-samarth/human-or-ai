It is a peculiar conundrum of city life that a simple collision of wood and wheel—in this case, a high-and-mighty carriage and a humble cart full of what appeared to be the earth’s most uninspired root vegetables—can instantly conjure a court of public opinion from the very cobblestones. The cartman wailed over his scattered turnips while the liveried driver merely sneered, and in a moment the two of them were surrounded. Immediately, every loafer, merchant, and perambulating busybody within earshot appointed himself chief magistrate to adjudicate the affair, a task they undertook with a thunderous and contradictory zeal. One bellowed that the rich man should pay double the cost of the vegetables, which seemed fair enough; but his neighbor insisted the driver ought to be made to eat a raw cabbage on the spot, which sounded a good deal more like entertainment. It seems to me that a man’s notion of a square deal depends mightily on whether he is holding the scales or the cudgel, and most of these folks looked to be in the market for a good, stout cudgel.
