Silas pinned me to the chair with a stare that could curdle milk, his voice a low rumble of impending damnation. He lectured me for a full half-hour on the evils of a five-dollar wager, his jowls quivering with a piety that would’ve made a bishop envious. It was a path to ruin, he said; a direct offense against a watchful Providence! All this from a man who’d just foreclosed on the Miller farm over a debt he himself had manufactured out of thin air and legal trickery. He leaned so far over that great mahogany desk—a desk, I might add, built from timber he’d acquired in a similarly dubious bargain—that I could smell the sanctimonious brandy on his breath. “A man’s soul,” he thundered, slamming a fist down so hard the stack of somebody else’s deeds jumped, “is not a thing to be gambled with!” I just sat there, thinking his own soul must have been cashed in long ago for a bad hand, and the devil was still waiting to collect on the marker.
