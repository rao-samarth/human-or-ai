Mr. Abernathy laid out the proposition on the checkered tablecloth, his voice as smooth and oily as the snake-medicine he used to sell, and the whole affair had the stink of a gilded calamity. All I had to do, you see, was furnish him a small bit of inconvenient truth about old Clement’s business—a truth that would sink Clement faster than a hog in a flash flood but would float me clear to a life of Sunday suits and fat cigars. I felt the weight of it then, right there in that noisy public house with the whole room pretending not to listen; you could’ve heard a moth sigh. A man’s soul, it seems, can be bought for a surprisingly plain price, and there it was, sitting right next to the salt shaker. He just smiled, his teeth like polished tombstones, waiting for an answer while I saw nothing but Clement’s honest, trusting face—the very face I’d have to look at come morning, knowing I’d traded twenty years of shared hardship for a pocketful of silver.
