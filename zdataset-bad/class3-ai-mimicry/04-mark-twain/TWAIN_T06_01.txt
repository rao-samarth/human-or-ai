Now, you listen here, and take this as gospel from a man who's seen a bit too much of the world. I am presently sat in a public dining house, and across the way is a feller whose face looks like it’s been pickled in vinegar. His beefsteak is growing cold on his plate—a perfectly good steak, mind you—and he don't even notice. And why? Because a table over, some young buck with a ten-dollar smile is laughing with a pretty girl. It is a peculiar brand of human misery, this self-inflicted robbery where a man convinces himself that his neighbor’s sunshine has somehow been pilfered directly from his own pocket; he sees another man’s good fortune not as a separate event in the universe, but as a personal and deliberate theft from his own empty hands. He’s so busy counting the other man’s blessings, you see, that he has plumb forgotten how to count his own. I reckon the poor devil would find a flaw in the prettiest sunset if he knew the good Lord was letting his rival see it too.
