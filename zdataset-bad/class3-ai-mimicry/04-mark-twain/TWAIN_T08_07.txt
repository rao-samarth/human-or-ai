I watched from a cafe window as a mob administered its own particular brand of settlement upon a pickpocket—a swift and brutish affair that left the man crumpled on the cobblestones. A righteous satisfaction rippled through the onlookers; they had seen a wrong and, without any of the tedious paperwork or bewigged arguments of a courtroom, they had made it right. But it struck me then that this was not the same creature as the one that lives in those cold stone buildings with the scales held high. That one, the official one, pretends to be about balancing a ledger, a slow and passionless arithmetic. This other business, this street-level verdict, is a different thing entirely; it is the simple, hot-blooded pleasure of the blow returned, and every man in the crowd appoints himself the judge, jury, and—most enthusiastically—the executioner. The whole notion of what is fair seems to hinge entirely upon which party can holler the loudest and gather the most fists to its cause.
