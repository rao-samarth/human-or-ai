I found myself once, rattling along in a railway car bound for somewhere of no particular consequence, seated opposite a portly fellow with a watch chain stretched to its limits. He was a man consumed. His ailment was not a cough, nor a fever, but a handsome new leather valise belonging to the quiet young man next to him. Our man’s gaze kept snagging on that valise, you see; he would study its fine stitching and gleaming buckles, then let his eyes fall with a thump upon his own sad, scuffed-up satchel that had plainly seen better decades. With every glance, he seemed to absorb a fresh dose of poison—a conviction that the universe had conspired to mock him personally with this display of superior luggage. He began to fidget and clear his throat, eyeing the young man as if he’d just caught him pocketing the family silver. It was a terrible thing to witness: a man viewing another’s simple property not as a thing of leather and brass, but as a loud sermon on his own insufficiency.
