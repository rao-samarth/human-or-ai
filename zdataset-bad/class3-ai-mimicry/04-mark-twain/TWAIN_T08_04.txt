The boy was half-lathered in the barber’s chair, but his eyes were blazing hot enough to scald the soap right off his chin.

Now, an old man waiting his turn piped up, his voice dry as last year’s corn husk. “So you aim to set the scales right by hopping on the other side and piling your own sins on top?” he asked, not unkindly. “It seems a peculiar way of balancing things, don't it?
