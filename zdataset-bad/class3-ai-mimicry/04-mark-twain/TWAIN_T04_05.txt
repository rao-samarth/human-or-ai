A man’s allegiance is a curious contraption; it runs smooth as buttered clockwork so long as the sun is shining and his belly is full. But you take that same man, put him in a stalled rail-car somewhere in the godforsaken middle of Nebraska with the dust baking the paint off the sides and his stomach making noises like a cornered badger—well, you see a different machine altogether. I saw my own traveling companion, a feller I’d have sworn by on a stack of almanacs, get a sudden and powerful affection for a cattle baron’s cushioned seat and a cold bottle of sarsaparilla. He didn’t so much abandon our shared misery in the cheap car as he did simply forget it existed, which I reckon is a worse crime. It showed me that a feller’s promises are only as durable as his present circumstances, and when comfort calls, memory has a convenient way of going deaf.
