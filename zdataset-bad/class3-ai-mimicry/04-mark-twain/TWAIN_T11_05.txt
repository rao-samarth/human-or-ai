I’ve always been persuaded there’s a kind of invisible measuring stick folks carry around, and they’ll size you up with it the minute you open your mouth—or even before. I saw it plain as day this morning, watching young Mr. Abernathy, who I reckon couldn’t tell a corn stalk from a fence post, instructing old Jedediah on the finer points of crop rotation. Now, Jed’s family has been coaxing life out of this very dirt since afore the county was even a county, and yet he stood there, nodding his head like a schoolboy being told the earth is round. Abernathy spoke with that almighty confidence that comes from a good inheritance and not a lick of sweat, and Jed, well, he listened with the patience that comes from knowing it’s often easier to agree with a fool than to argue with him. It ain't the sense in a man's head that gives his words weight, you see; it's the jingle in his pocket and the lack of mud on his boots.
