"See that solemn-looking customer in the corner?" my companion whispered, nudging me as the train rattled onward. "The one with a face so long you’d think he was personally acquainted with every sorrow since Adam? A bishop, I’d wager, or at least some high-minded professor." I had to admit, the man cut a fine figure, all buttoned up in respectable black, his nose buried in a thick, leather-bound volume that looked heavy with eternal truths. He looked like the kind of feller who'd sooner swallow a hornet than tell a fib. But I happened to know better, having seen him work a shell game back in St. Joe that was a pure masterpiece of misdirection. That book he's so devoted to ain't filled with scripture; it's hollowed out, and inside he keeps three walnut shells and a pea so quick you’d need spectacles on your spectacles to follow it. He ain’t contemplating salvation, son; he’s just practicing his thumb-work for the next depot.
