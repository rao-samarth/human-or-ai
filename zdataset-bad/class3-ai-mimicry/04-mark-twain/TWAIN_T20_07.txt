Cousin Silas sat by the hearth, lecturing the younger set on the spiritual affliction of worldly attachments, a sermon he had polished by such constant use that it shone brighter than the brass andirons. He spoke with a sorrowful air about the shackles of property, the tyranny of a fine suit of clothes, and the hollow comfort of a full larder—and all the while his thumb stroked, almost lovingly, the gold watch-fob that had belonged to his late brother. We all knew his brother had meant for that watch to go to his own son, a boy now working for pennies at the mill, but Silas had discovered some forgotten codicil in the will, a bit of providential ink that delivered the timepiece into his more deserving pocket. He caught me looking once, and his pious expression did not waver in the slightest. It was a peculiar thing, watching a man mourn the very burdens he had fought so hard to acquire for himself.
