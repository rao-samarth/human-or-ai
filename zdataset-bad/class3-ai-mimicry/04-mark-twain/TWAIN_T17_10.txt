A man will sooner forgive you for questioning his parentage than for correcting a cherished bit of his personal history. We were all gathered for supper, a peaceable assembly, when my uncle began a long-winded account of the year the old mill burned down, and in doing so, he misplaced the event by a full season—stating it was autumn when any fool with a calendar and a memory knew it was the dead of winter. His own son, a decent boy but cursed with an itch for accuracy, saw fit to amend the record. You would have thought he had spit on the family Bible. The argument that erupted was a marvel of pig-headedness, a conflagration that was no longer about a season but about respect, and honor, and the gall of a youth to trust a fact over his own father. The roast grew cold upon the platter, and two branches of the family tree were sawed clean off—all because a man would rather burn a bridge than admit the snow had fallen in January.
