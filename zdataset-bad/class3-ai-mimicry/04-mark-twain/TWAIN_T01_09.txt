I was taking my ease in the lobby of a rather respectable hotel, listening to the low murmur of commerce, when two gentlemen nearby began to praise the industry of a mutual acquaintance. The man had, according to their account, a ladder in his soul, and his every waking thought was dedicated to its upward climb. This notion struck me as being only half-correct; a man so singularly focused is forever occupied with the next rung, and he gives no more thought to the ground he has left than a bird gives to the empty shell of its egg. Every ounce of his character that does not aid in the ascent is reckoned as dead weight and promptly jettisoned; old friendships, certain inconvenient scruples, the simple capacity for an idle hour—all are tossed overboard to lighten the load. He arrives at the pinnacle, it is true, but he arrives as a magnificently efficient piece of machinery for climbing—and nothing more.
