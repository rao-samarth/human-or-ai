There ain't nothing so loud as the stillness of a town after midnight, when the only thing stirring is your own miserable thoughts. A man’s conscience, I have come to believe, is a most unreasonable and peevish sort of tenant; it pays no rent, but it makes a terrible racket when it ain’t satisfied with the accommodations. I’d spent the better part of the evening explaining to myself the sound logic of my dealings with old Mr. Abernathy—how the circumstances demanded a certain stretching of the facts, a necessary and harmless adjustment for the greater good of my own hide. But the little preacher inside my head wasn't buying the sermon. It just kept on hammering away at the one plain truth of the matter, poking and prodding until all my fine arguments looked as flimsy as a spider's web in a windstorm. It is a vexing thing, to find yourself the sole scoundrel in a courtroom of one, with a judge who knows all the evidence before you even think to lie.
