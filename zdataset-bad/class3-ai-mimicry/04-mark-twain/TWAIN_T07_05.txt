There wasn't a man in three counties who took his authority more seriously than the Postmaster, a fellow whose uniform seemed starched with pure indignation. He was laying into a farmer about the improper wrapping on a parcel, his voice carrying clear across the general store where a dozen of us were pretending to inspect barrels of pickles. The farmer, a quiet man not known for argument, simply listened with his head cocked. When the Postmaster finally ran out of breath and regulations, the farmer just nodded and said, soft enough for only a few to hear, “Reckon it’ll get there all the same.” Then he turned and walked out, leaving the package on the counter. A peculiar silence fell upon the room; we all knew that parcel would now be “lost” out of pure spite, and yet not a one of us could rightly condemn the farmer. We were caught, you see, between the commonsense truth of the thing and the durned foolishness of a man who mistakes his little brass buttons for a king’s crown. To leave the parcel was defiance, but to take it back would be to admit the crown was real.
