There is no finer theater for a man to display his Christian goodness than a bustling city thoroughfare, where his performance is guaranteed a respectable audience. I saw Mr. Abernathy—a man whose considerable fortune was matched only by his considerable opinion of himself—enact such a play just yesterday. He paused before some poor soul whose only worldly possession was a cough, and with a flourish that would do an actor proud, he dropped a nickel into the man's cup as if he were bestowing the crown jewels. A fine spectacle, it was. Having thus secured his public reputation for the afternoon, he promptly turned and loosed a torrent of abuse upon a small cart-pusher for scuffing his polished boot, a tirade of such magnificent fury you'd think the boy had just insulted his sainted mother. It seems a man's charity is a sort of thunderclap; it makes a great noise all at once and then there is nothing left but a faint echo and the same old sour weather.
