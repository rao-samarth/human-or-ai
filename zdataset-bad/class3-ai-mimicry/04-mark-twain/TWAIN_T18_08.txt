It is a peculiar truth, observable chiefly in those tranquil corners of the world where a man has ample time to bungle his affairs, that the simplest of undertakings possesses an almost supernatural capacity for inviting calamity. I watched my neighbor, a fellow of profound good intentions and even profounder ineptitude, set out merely to replace a single fence-post—a task a sensible child might complete between breakfast and noon. Yet the enterprise, which began with a misplaced shovel, soon escalated to a quarrel with a stubborn rock, and presently involved a runaway wheelbarrow, a startled flock of hens, and a length of rope that had evidently pledged its allegiance to some other, more chaotic, physical law. By afternoon, the original post remained defiantly in its place, while the man had succeeded only in excavating a hole large enough to bury his ambitions in, all the while maintaining a look of bewildered injury, as if Providence itself had singled him out for this particular persecution.
