It was a peculiar and expensive brand of vexation that settled upon old Jedediah Coombs after a traveling surveyor, a man with more instruments than sense, casually remarked that his north-field fence post was a quarter-inch shy of true. Now, another fellow might have given the post a good kick and forgotten the matter, but Jedediah’s fences were his public statement, the straight-lined signature of his character. He did not merely correct the post; no, that would have been the action of a sensible man, which was a species Jedediah held in low regard when his good name was at stake. Instead, he proceeded to uproot two solid miles of perfectly good cedar fence—sacrificing his spring planting and incurring the simmering, silent wrath of his wife—just to re-sink the whole affair with a level and a prayer. A man’s standing in the community, you see, is a mighty fragile and costly thing to maintain, especially when the perceived stain upon it is a fiction visible only to himself.
