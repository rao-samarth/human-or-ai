There ain't nothing that will so warp a man's piety as the whisper of a coming railroad or the scent of a new land speculation. I've seen a whole town, mind you, a whole congregation of God-fearing souls who tithed with regularity and spoke ill of no one, suddenly turn into a nest of sharp-eyed calculators overnight. A man's conscience, which he'll parade about on Sunday like a prize hog at the county fair, shrinks to the size of a dried pea when a city man in a fine suit starts talking about rights-of-way and handsome compensation. Why, fellows you’d trust with your last dollar start looking at their neighbor’s scraggly pasture as if it were the Promised Land itself, and their own memory of property lines gets conveniently muddled. It is a peculiar sort of fever, one that makes a fellow forget his own good name for the chance to trade it for a heavier purse.
