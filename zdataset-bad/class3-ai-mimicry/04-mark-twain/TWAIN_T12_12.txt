The gas lamp hissed a lonely tune in the otherwise silent accounting office, and my pen, which had been scratching along as dutifully as a church mouse, came to a dead halt right over Mr. Abernathy’s quarterly figures. I checked the addition thrice, and then a fourth time for good measure, but the result was stubbornly the same. There it was, plain as a wart on a parson's nose—a clerical error of such a magnificent and profitable dimension that it felt less like a mistake and more like a direct, whispered invitation from Providence itself. Who would know? Mr. Abernathy, a man who used hundred-dollar bills to light his cigars, certainly wouldn’t notice such a trifle, and the company books had more secrets than a traveling preacher. My own conscience, a notoriously poor and ill-fed creature, began to put up a small fuss, but the vision of a new winter coat and a steak dinner argued its case with a far more compelling eloquence. It is a curious thing how a man’s arithmetic skills improve so dramatically when he is calculating his own good fortune.
