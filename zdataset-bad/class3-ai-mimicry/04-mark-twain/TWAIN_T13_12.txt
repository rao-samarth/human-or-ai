Well, a man can build a mighty fine opinion of himself in the space of a single evening—a regular Taj Mahal of personal genius, all shining and grand in the lamplight of a parlor. He can sit there, puffed up like a toad in a puddle, believing every syllable that falls from his own lips is a pearl of undeniable wisdom destined for the history books. And then, with the uttering of just one unfortunate sentence, a sentence he had polished in his mind until it gleamed, the whole glittering structure comes crashing down with a silence more deafening than a cannonade. Suddenly, the lamplight feels a good deal more like an interrogation lamp, and all those admiring faces have rearranged themselves into masks of polite confusion, or worse, pity. You find you're not a genius after all; you're just the fool who brought the whole tent down on his own head, and now must sit alone in the dark, examining the rubble with a hot-faced diligence that would have been better spent on keeping your mouth shut in the first place.
