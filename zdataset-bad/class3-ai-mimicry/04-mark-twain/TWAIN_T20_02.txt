Mr. Abernathy leaned so close across his mahogany desk that I could count the pious whiskers on his chin, each one a testament to his unshakeable virtue. He explained, with the slow patience one reserves for a half-wit or a heathen, that a man’s soul is a garden which must be regularly weeded of avarice and fertilized with charity—a holy duty, he called it. All the while he was delivering this sermon, his thumb was methodically polishing a silver dollar he’d pulled from his vest. I recognized the coin; it was the very one he’d argued out of the widow Gable’s hand not an hour before, convincing the poor woman that the cord of wood she’d delivered was full of green pine and worth a dollar less than their agreement. He spoke of the glorious light that fills a man who gives freely, and I reckoned he must be right, for the shine on that dollar was so immediate and brilliant that Heaven itself couldn't have managed a swifter benediction.
