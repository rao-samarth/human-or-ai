I find there is a peculiar and altogether democratic affliction that thrives in the press of a great city, where a man can catch it just by looking. He spies another fellow sporting a finer hat or walking arm-in-arm with a woman whose laughter rings a clearer bell than his own wife’s, and right then—quicker than a summer ague—the world tilts. His own perfectly serviceable bowler becomes a disgrace, his supper a chore, and the very air he breathes seems secondhand, as if it had passed through his rival’s lungs first for purification. It is a self-administered poison, nothing more; a miserable internal arithmetic where you are always subtracting the other man’s good fortune from your own meager sum. A man will convince himself he is impoverished by the simple existence of a neighbor’s fatter pig, and he’ll burn down his own house for the momentary satisfaction of watching the other fellow choke on the smoke.
