Out there in the sun-baked dust of the county road, my neighbor Henderson was endeavoring to have a serious talk with his mule, an animal whose chief opinion seemed to be that the world was best observed from a stationary position. Henderson yelled, he cajoled, he even brought forth a theological argument or two concerning the beast's infernal destination should it fail to proceed. The mule just twitched an ear, as if to wave away a particularly bothersome fly—which, I suppose, is all the man’s fury amounted to. It puts a man in mind of how a great deal of declared authority works in this world; it’s a grand spectacle of reins and harnesses and loud commands, all of it depending on the solemn agreement of the governed to be governed. But when one creature, be it a long-eared mule or a short-tempered farmer, quietly decides that the agreement is null and void, the whole magnificent parade comes to a dead halt, leaving the fellow with the whip looking like the completest kind of fool.
