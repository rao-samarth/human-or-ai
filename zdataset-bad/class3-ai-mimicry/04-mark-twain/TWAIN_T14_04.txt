I sat watching a fool-headed miller bug conduct his final, grand campaign against the chimney of my reading lamp. He was, in his own buzzing estimation, a captain of his own soul, a navigator charting a bold course toward a private sun—and ain’t that the very tune we all whistle to keep the dark away? A man builds a fortune and calls it shrewdness, never minding the fact he was born next door to the bank; another man starves and calls it the cruelty of the world, forgetting he was born with a hole in his pocket from the start. This little general here, he batters his brains out against the hot glass, convinced he is forging a path to glory, when all he is doing is obeying a pull he cannot name toward a destination he cannot reach. It seems to me the main difference between him and the rest of us is that his particular brand of inescapable foolishness is a good deal more honest, and a sight quicker to reach its foregone conclusion.
