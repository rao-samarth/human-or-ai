I simply gave it a proper platform and a louder voice. And yet, the infernal parliament that convenes inside a man’s skull whenever he’s done a thing won’t let the matter rest; it holds its session right behind the eyes, debating the particulars and cross-examining the motives until you feel like a first-class scoundrel for what was, by any reasonable measure, an act of commercial charity. It’s a pesky thing to be celebrated by your boss while being prosecuted by your own insides.
