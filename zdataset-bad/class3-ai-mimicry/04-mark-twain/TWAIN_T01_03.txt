I find there’s a certain musical quality to the clamor of a city street, provided a man has enough coin in his pocket to stand above the fray and merely listen. Just yonder I spied old Finch, a fellow I ran with in leaner days, looking as if he’d had a lengthy argument with a wagon wheel and lost decisively. A sensible man might feel a pang of something—call it pity, if you’re the sentimental type—but I have learned that the ladder to a higher station has no room for two sets of boots on the same rung; one must climb, and if the other fellow hasn’t the good sense to hold on tight, well, gravity is a law of nature and not a personal failing of my own. He didn't see me, of course. I adjusted my new coat, felt the satisfying weight of my watch-chain, and continued on my way, a solitary king in a kingdom of ghosts I used to know.
