You have built a most respectable fence around your version of the affair, I will grant you that. The posts are set deep and the paint is fresh, and any man passing on the road would admire the clean lines of it. He would never reckon, you see, that the property line it marks is a curious thing indeed—a thing drawn up not by a surveyor, but by an artist with a particular fondness for his own garden. You have presented a map of the land which shows your neighbor's well sitting squarely on your side of the boundary, a detail which, while convenient for you, leaves the other fellow with a considerable thirst. It is an admirable piece of map-making, to be sure, but it is not geography; it is a declaration of ownership based on little more than ambition and a steady hand with the ink.
