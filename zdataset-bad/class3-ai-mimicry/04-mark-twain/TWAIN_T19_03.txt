The ticking of that tall clock in the hall is the only sound you'll hear in this house after midnight, and I've come to be persuaded it's the most dishonest sound in Christendom. There she stands, all polished cherry-wood and brassy confidence, with a pendulum that swings back and forth like a preacher warming to his sermon. But the whole contraption, you understand, is a gilded fraud. It gains near four minutes a day—a fact known only to me and the sun, and the sun ain't telling. And yet, the whole household sets its comings and goings by its chime, pretending its handsome face tells a truth the heavens themselves can't quite manage. It has taught me a powerful lesson about the nature of a fine reputation; most are built on just such a steady, confident, and entirely inaccurate ticking.
