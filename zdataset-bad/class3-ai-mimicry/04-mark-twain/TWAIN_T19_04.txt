A man observing our little reunion from the porch might’ve supposed he was looking upon the very bedrock of human discord, for the arguments flew about the room like misguided hornets. My cousin was explaining, with a good deal of volume, why the town council was composed of nincompoops, and his sister was loudly defending those same nincompoops with a loyalty that would have shamed a Praetorian Guard. It was a proper storm of opinions, a genuine hurricane of contradictions. But that observer, you see, he wouldn't have noticed the quieter facts; he wouldn't have seen the way my cousin, mid-tirade, reached over to brush a crumb from his sister's collar, nor the shared smile that passed between them a moment later. No, he would only see the bluster and miss the whole point—that this loud, contrary affection was the very thing that anchored us all, a foundation so solid it could afford a few cracks on the surface just for show.
