The new fellow in accounting, Mr. Albright, is a specimen of such industrious cheerfulness that it fair gives a man indigestion. He arrives before the sun has any sensible ideas about starting its day, and he leaves long after the cleaning crew has given up on the place, all the while sporting a smile that looks screwed on for permanence. The manager, a man who would applaud a fox for its sincere interest in hen-house security, proclaims this Albright a “model of modern enterprise.” I reckon he’s a model of something, to be sure. A man who shows you all his cards at once is a man who wants you to pay no mind to the extra ace he’s got tucked in his sleeve. This whole song-and-dance of tireless devotion—it’s a brand of humbuggery more polished than a banker’s shoes, a slick disguise for a soul that’s busy calculating every angle and counting every coin, especially the ones still in your pocket.
