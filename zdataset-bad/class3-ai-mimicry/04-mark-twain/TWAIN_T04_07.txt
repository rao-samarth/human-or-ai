You sit there in my best chair, Silas, looking for all the world like a preacher who’s just discovered a fresh sinner to save, and I haven’t got the heart to interrupt the performance. I always figured the foundation we built between us was solid granite, a thing a man could bank on when the floods came calling—a regular Gibraltar of an understanding. But it seems I was mistaken; it was only sugar-candy after all, the kind that looks mighty fine in the jar but dissolves to nothing at the first serious downpour. And for no more than the jingle of coin in a stranger’s pocket, you let the whole confounded works wash away into the ditch. The money’s a plain nuisance, I grant you, but the real, soul-deep affliction is discovering that a man you’d have sworn by was only ever leased, and never properly owned.
