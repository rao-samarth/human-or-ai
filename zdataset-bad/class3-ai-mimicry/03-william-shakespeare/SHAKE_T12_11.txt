I ask you, what honest man, in this dark and silent hour, couldst look upon such an unguarded prize and turn his back? The document lay there, upon his desk, a simple scroll of parchment whose signature alone was worth more than all my weary years of service. A faint and feeble voice within me didst plead for loyalty, for the bonds of trust betwixt a master and his man; but O, the glittering promise of a life unyoked from servitude made a far louder argument! He hath more than his just measure of fortune's favour, and providence itself, I think, did leave his chamber door unlocked for my express advantage. My hand, I swear, was steady in the deed, a loyal servant to my will's command. Why, then, doth my very spirit now quake within this house of flesh, as if some inner judge hath already pass'd his damning sentence ere the morning comes?
