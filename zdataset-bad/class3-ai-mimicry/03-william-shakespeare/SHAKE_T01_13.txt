Nay, chide me not for reaching toward a sun you deem too bright, nor speak of the dark price a spirit pays for its own lofty flight. You see a perilous fall in every upward glance and name my heart's great striving as a fool's unlucky chance; but I see in this burning wish the very fire of heaven, a sacred duty given us to rise from our own dust. What is a man whose heart is still, whose hands seek out no prize? A ship that rots in harbour, safe from any storm's surprise, yet never knows the glory of a new and distant shore. Let lesser men content themselves with what they were before; I say the soul that yearns for more, that risks a peaceful night for but a glimpse of some great dawn, is one who walks in light, and in his quest, he may yet build a kingdom for us all.
