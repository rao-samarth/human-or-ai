By the last flicker of this weary candle, I do but number o’er the day’s dark business. The fault is not writ upon my brow for other men to see, nor doth my hand tremble as it did when first the lie was forged. Nay, all is placid now, the house is still, and yet within this quiet chamber, a sterner court is held. My own reason sits in judgment, and it finds this new-won comfort a most sour and unwholesome prize. I have traded a friend’s good name for a trifle of advantage, a bargain that seemed most shrewd in the telling, but which in the silent reckoning leaves the soul impoverished. This inner ledger, which no eye but mine can read, shows a debt that cannot be repaid with coin or station, for it is a deficit of mine own self, a hollowness where honour used to be.
