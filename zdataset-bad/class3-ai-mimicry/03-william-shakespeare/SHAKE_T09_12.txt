Wherefore doth my hand not shake, nor my countenance betray the wretched theatre play’d within this breast? Here I sit at my appointed desk, a man of some account, yet that account is false. A single, ill-writ entry, a whispered lie to a superior, hath poisoned the entire book of my own soul. This ghost of what I’ve done, a silent partner in all my new employ, sits ever at my elbow, pointing its cold finger at each honest word I speak or pen. It maketh a mockery of my good repute and turns each colleague’s trusting glance into a fresh-forged accusation. I have sold my quiet mind for a pittance of advantage, and now must keep the books of my own damnation, a secret clerk to ruin.
