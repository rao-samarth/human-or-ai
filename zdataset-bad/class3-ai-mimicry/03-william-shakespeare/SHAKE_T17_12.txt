Behold the grand theatre of this counting-house, where fortunes are undone by a fool’s hearing. The portly Master Hemlock, his mind already feasting upon a roasted capon, did but flick his wrist at the ledger and grunt, “See this business concluded.” A simple charge, mark you, for the boy to blot the ink and shut the book. Yet young Finch, that poxy aspirant whose ears are ever tuned to trumpets where only a penny-whistle sounds, did construe this as a command of thunderous weight. He, in his great and addled wisdom, took it to mean the utter ruin of our chiefest patron over a trifling sum! And with what speed the goose-quill flew, penning a missive of such final insult as to curdle milk. Now our master cries havoc, Hemlock sweats with fear, and a prosperous trade lies slain, all for a mumbled word and an ambitious dolt's interpretation. Truly, a kingdom might be lost for want of a clearer throat.
