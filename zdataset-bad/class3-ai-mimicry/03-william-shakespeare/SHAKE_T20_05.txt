Pray, good sirs, lend an ear to this pillar of our state, whose every word is a sermon against the world’s excess. With what fine passion doth he condemn the miser’s hoard, decrying the love of gold as a canker on the soul; yet mark how his own fingers, heavy with rings, do twitch and dance when talk of a new-found venture doth arise. He speaks of humble living, of a spirit pure and unadorned, all whilst his masons toil to raise another wing upon his house, grander than the last. Forsooth, he is a most excellent physician who prescribes a fast for all mankind, but sups himself on capon and on claret till the cock doth crow. Tell me, sir, is thy conscience but another garment, to be put on for public show and cast aside when none are there to see?
