Hark, a floorboard groans! I sprang from my troubled slumber, my hand flying to the dagger left upon the nightstand, for what honest soul stirs at such an hour? There, by the casement where the wan moonlight did creep, a ghastly shape took form—a hulking brute, his shoulders sloped as if with malice, a cruel hook raised in his hand. My heart, a frantic drum, beat a swift retreat against my ribs. Some thief, I knew it, come to slit my throat for a few paltry coins! With a half-choked cry, I lunged across the chamber, ready to spill his blood upon the oaken floor. Yet my desperate thrust met not flesh, but the heavy velvet of my own winter cloak, hung carelessly upon a high-backed chair, its silver clasp, the wicked hook, now catching the pale light in mockery. Thus does a mind possessed by fear make villains of the shadows and arm a simple garment with a murderer’s intent.
