You counsel patience, and bid me suffer the slanders of a lesser man as one might suffer a biting fly: a brief annoyance, soon forgotten. But here you misjudge the nature of the wound, for a thief may take my purse and I am merely poorer for a day; the coffer may be fill'd again. Yet he who steals my credit, who poisons the well of my report amongst my fellows, he doth commit a theft of a far dearer sort. That which is lost is not a thing of substance, but the very substance of my standing; it is the currency by which all true commerce is done. What good is a full-stocked larder if no honest man will sit at my table? Nay, I will not abide it. Let this quarrel cost me what it may, for a man stripped of all but his good name is still a man, whilst one who hath all else and that thing not, is but a gilded ghost, a hollow echo in the halls he claims to own.
