Think you I am so blind, my lord, that I cannot see the serpent coiled beneath the fairest flower? You wear your courtesy like a player's cloak, a thing of rich hue and pleasing cut, yet it covers a heart of common sackcloth, stained with ambition's dirt. To all the court you show a saintly visage, a calm and placid surface where no ill thought may ripple; but I have supped with you in private chambers and have seen the wolf's hunger that glitters in your eye when you believe no one doth mark it. Pray, sir, spare me these honeyed words and gentle looks, for they are but the sweet poison in a golden cup, and I have seen the truth that lies in the bitter dregs.
