Master Giles stood by the market cross, though he saw not the merchants nor heard their clamorous calls, for a fouler commerce had taken hold of his mind. A whisper, born of some idle knave's invention, had now grown to a full-throated accusation in the taverns and lanes of the town. He knew the charge to be a phantom, a thing of no substance, yet it stalked him in the altered faces of his neighbours, their glances now quick and sideways. What folly were it to let this poison spread? To stand silent whilst lesser men tore down the work of a lifetime, a name built upon honest dealings and a sober carriage? Nay, for a man’s report is the very coin of his soul, the one true inheritance he may leave his sons. Let them take his purse, let them seize his very house; but to suffer his name to be so sullied was a death of a different sort, and he would pay any price, howsoever dear, to see the lie strangled in its cradle.
