You demand of me the reason for my rage, yet you see the cause writ plain upon my very hands, calloused from a toil his soft fingers never knew. Aye, I raised my fist to him whose lineage grants a tongue of poison and a soul of impunity. Was I to stand dumbly whilst he mocked the very bread I break, the humble roof that shields my kin? In your eyes, his lightest word doth outweigh my heaviest truth, for his blood runs a richer course, and his idleness is deemed a virtue next to my sweat. When one man's birthright is the lash and another's is the holding of it, can you feign such great surprise that the wielder's arm should at last be stayed? Condemn me if you must, but know this: my only true offence was to forget, for a single, heated moment, the part that Providence had writ for me to play.
