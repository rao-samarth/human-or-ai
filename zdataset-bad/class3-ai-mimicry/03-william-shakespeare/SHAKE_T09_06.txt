Here in this hall of feasting and of mirth, where kinsmen raise their cups in seeming cheer, a bitter poison works within my blood. My brother speaks a jest, and all give laugh, yet his kind face, which knows not of my plot, doth serve as judgement’s glass to show my soul its own deformed and wretched countenance. O, this feigned smile sits like a leaden mask upon my lips! For every word of fellowship he speaks, a thousand silent accusers cry out "Villain!" within the chambers of my heart. The wine is ash upon my tongue, the music but a dull and mournful drone to ears that hear naught save the ceaseless clamour of a deed ill-done. This company is but a painted torment, and I, its chiefest ghost, am damned to haunt the banquet of my own black making, forever starving while I falsely feast.
