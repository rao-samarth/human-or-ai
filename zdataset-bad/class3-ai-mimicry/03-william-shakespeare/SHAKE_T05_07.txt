Though music swells and wine doth freely pour to grace this gathering, my spirit finds no cheer. My promised bride sits near, her gentle hand upon my sleeve, a picture of such virtue as my father’s house requires; yet mine own eyes, those traitors to my will, do seek another. Across the hall, where laughter rings most false, there stands the sun that warms my frozen soul. Her very glance is a summons I must spurn, her smile a sweet treason against the alliance sealed by state and seal. What prison is this gilded honour, what chains are forged of solemn vows and kingly favour? I am bound fast to this cold, northern star of duty, whilst all my being yearns for that forbidden light in the south. I must play the loyal son, and raise my cup, and speak of fortunes, while every beat of this poor, wretched heart doth cry her name against the bars of my sworn word.
