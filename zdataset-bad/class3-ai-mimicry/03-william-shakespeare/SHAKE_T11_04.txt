Pray, mark this fellow, how he bows and scrapes before the merchant’s son, a dolt whose only wit lies in his father’s coffers. And see how the common folk do part for him, as if his very flesh were made of finer clay! O, what a cunning pageant doth our life become, where every man must play a part he did not choose, born into his costume, be it silk or sackcloth, and told to speak his lines as they are writ by fortune's foolish hand. They will say God made us all, yet 'twas mere circumstance that made us masters and servants. This invisible chain, forged ere we drew our first breath, is a heavier burden than any iron shackle a gaoler could devise, for it binds not the body but the spirit, and chokes the very heart of a man’s truest aspiration.
