Hark, how they flock to him now, this new-come merchant with his silken coat and a purse that jingles a siren’s song. Why, but a fortnight past, old Miller John would sooner give his right arm than a false measure of flour; yet I saw him this very morn, with mine own eyes, weigh a light bag for the merchant's table, grinning as if he had performed some noble deed. And mark how Goodwife Ellen, who once prayed so loudly in her pew, now curtsies low and speaks in honeyed whispers, hoping a glance from the great man might fall upon her daughter. It is a strange and creeping pestilence, this lust for what another hath. It doth poison the well of common decency, turning honest neighbours into scheming jackdaws, each one eager to peck out another's eye for a single glittering bead to line a nest that was, till yesterday, quite comfortable enough.
