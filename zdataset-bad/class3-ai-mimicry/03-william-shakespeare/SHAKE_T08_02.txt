Prithee, speak no more of courts and patient law; for what slow-footed magistrate can weigh an injury that cuts the very spirit? You call for tempered reason, a measured scale to find the right of it, but when the weights themselves are false and the hand that holds the balance is a perjured one, who then must set the reckoning straight? Some men are given ledgers, some the plough, but I was given this righteous anger, a fire in the blood to burn away corruption. It is a surgeon's work I contemplate, not a butcher's, to carve the sickness from the bone ere it infects us all. This is no hot-blooded quest for recompense, but the cold and holy duty of a man who sees the world askew and has been given the will, and the steel, to make it level once again. To call it by a lesser name is but the coward's art of dressing truth in rags.
