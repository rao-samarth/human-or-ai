He sits now by the hearth, the fire’s last breath casting long shadows upon his weary countenance. The tale he spun of his long absence hath the shape of truth, yet lacks its very substance; ‘tis a story fashioned for a woman’s ear, all smoothed of its sharp corners and its bloody stains. He offers me this hollowed thing as one might offer a child a painted wooden apple, fair to the eye but bitter and false to the tooth. Wherefore doth he so dissemble? He thinks, perchance, to shield me from some harshness, but in this careful culling of his words, he builds a wall betwixt our souls. What he doth leave unsaid cries out the louder, speaking of a world kept hidden from my sight. This piece of a history he gives me is a poor and barren country, whilst the full account he keeps unto himself must be a kingdom vast and terrible.
