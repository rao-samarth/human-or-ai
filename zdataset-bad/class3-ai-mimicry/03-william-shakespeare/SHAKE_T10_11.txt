Mark how mine uncle holds the table now, his voice a measured and deliberate instrument playing upon the ears of all his kin. He speaks of the late venture with the merchant ships, recounting a tale so cunningly sheared of its rougher edges it gleams with a false simplicity. He bestows a lavish praise upon my cousin Edward for his final stroke of wit which won the day; and in this, he speaks no lie. Yet of William’s part, who laid the very ground-work and did risk his own small fortune when the matter was in doubt, he is most eloquently silent. Thus he presents a fact, whole in its own shape, but which, by want of its brother-fact, becomes a monster of another sort. I see the subtle poison work its course: one brother’s heart is puffed with undeserved pride, whilst the other’s curdles with a silent grievance, and our patriarch sits pleased, having divided them with but the shadow of a spoken thing.
