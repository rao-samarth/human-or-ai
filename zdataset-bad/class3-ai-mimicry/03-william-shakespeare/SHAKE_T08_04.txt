You bid me join the common cry against the wainwright, yet I must hold my tongue though all the market-square should call me coward for it. I grant you, his deceit hath cost our village dearly, and many a goodman’s cart now lies with a splintered axle in the mud; but what this roaring crowd demands is not that the man should make amends, but that his house be unroofed and his own bones broken in a like manner. Prithee, tell me where true settlement is found: in the magistrate’s sober decree that a debt be paid with coin and honest labour, or in the hot-blooded satisfaction of seeing one wrong answered with a greater? For when every wronged man becomes his own law and his own executioner, our town becomes naught but a pit of serpents, each devouring the other’s tail until nothing doth remain.
