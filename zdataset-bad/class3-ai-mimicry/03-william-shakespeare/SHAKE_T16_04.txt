The great hall, once loud with boast and merry song, did fall to a hush as my lord uncle held forth, his pronouncements like poisoned darts aimed at the good name of a man not there to give defense. And I, who had sat a silent shadow at the board, felt a cold serpent coil within my breast, for his every word was villainy wrapped in gilded cloth. To speak was to invite his terrible wrath, to be cast out from this house and favour; yet to hold my tongue was a greater shame, a poison that would curdle the very soul. What is a man, if not the voice he gives to truth when falsehood sits enthroned? My heart hammered a frantic drum against my ribs, a traitor’s beat that bid me stay quiet, yet my resolve did stiffen like winter's ice. Let the storm break, then; better to be struck down for honour's cause than live a long life, a coward to myself.
