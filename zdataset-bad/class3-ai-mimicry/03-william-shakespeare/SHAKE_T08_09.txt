In the deep of night, when only the guttering candle gave witness, his hand did hover o'er the fatal scroll. To sign it were to mete out what the law itself decreed, a rightful balancing of a scale long tilted by villainy. Yet what poison stirred within his own breast? Was this equity's cold hand, or the hot and grasping fist of a private wrong seeking its bloody recompense? The law doth grant a man a sword to guard the common good, but when his own heart is wounded, the blade oft serves a darker master. He saw not the public felon, but the private foe whose words had sundered his own peace. And so the question, which no king can answer nor any judge truly resolve, hung in the wavering light: who gives the scale into a mortal hand, and by what art can that same hand weigh true when its own blood cries out for vengeance?
