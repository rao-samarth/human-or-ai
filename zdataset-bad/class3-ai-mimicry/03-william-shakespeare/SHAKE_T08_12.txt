Here in the fields, where the sun measures the day with an even hand and the river asks no leave to follow its course, a man might think the world’s accounts are simply kept. Yet a grievance, like a bitter root, grows deep in any soil. Some would have a weighing of the deed, a cold and careful portioning of consequence, such that the balance of things is once more restored; they call this the work of reason, of a law that stands above the heat of men’s passions. But another man, whose heart is a furnace stoked by injury, will claim his own hot settlement, crying that only the sufferer knows the proper payment for his pain. And so the matter turns upon itself: doth the true settlement spring from a mind untouched by the offence, or can it only be judged by the soul that bears the scar? Perchance true quittance is but a phantom, for one man’s level measure is another’s empty cup.
