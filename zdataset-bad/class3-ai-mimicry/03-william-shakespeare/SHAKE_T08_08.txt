Yon carrion crow, that picks at what remains of a man upon the gallows-tree, doth feast upon a king's decree; yet I must ask, what appetite was sated ere the bird began its meal? They call this a right and proper settling of accounts, a balancing of the world's great ledger. But I see in it not the cold hand of reason but the heated grasp of a private fury, given leave to wear a righteous mask. For when one man's blood calls for another's, it is a raw and hungry thing, a debt that seeks its payment in the selfsame coin, caring not if the world be made more honest thereby. A magistrate in his fine robes may weigh the deed and pronounce it fair, but his scales were first set not by law, but by the shriek of a grieving soul. Thus the hangman’s knot is oft but passion’s final, furious word, writ large upon the sky for all to see.
