You ask me wherefore I have watched your house, and why your every coming and your going is noted in my book. Call you this a sickness? Then you, sir, are the physician who hath poisoned me! For when a man speaks false with one tongue and smiles with another, when his shadow falls upon paths where honesty dare not tread, what choice is left for one who seeks the simple truth of things? I did but seek the kernel of your meaning, the hidden seed from which such double-dealing grows. Think me mad if you must, but every shutter drawn, every whispered word you shared behind your hand, was but a goad and a challenge to my wits. I have not slept; nay, sleep is a traitor's comfort. I have only watched, and listened, and waited for the mask to fall at last.
