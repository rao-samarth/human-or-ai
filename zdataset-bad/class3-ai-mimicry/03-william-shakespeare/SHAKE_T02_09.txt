The press of the thoroughfare is a beast of many heads, and I am but one small sinew in its mighty frame, jostled and driven by the common tide. Yet my eye, a traitor to the general crush, hath found a single face among the thousand shifting masks of men. Can it be he? That very same lord whose tongue did once drip such honeyed oaths into my father's ear, promising alliances and endless faith? Now see him, garbed in a merchant's plainest wool, his mien as humble as the wares he feigns to sell, his noble gait exchanged for a tradesman's hurried shuffle. He hawks his paltry goods with a voice I know too well, though roughened now to suit his station's fall. Alas, this city is a stage for such poor players; every man puts on the countenance he needs, and what soul truly knows his neighbour's heart? He sees me not, or if he doth, his glance is but the vacant stare of one who fears a coming debt, and I, what part play I, to nod and pass, as if this painted falsehood were the very truth itself?
