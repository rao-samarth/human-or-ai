Prithee, do not think me mad, though madness were a gentler state than this unceasing torment. I walk our familiar lanes, and every stone doth seem to cry out my offence; the goodwife at the well, who once gave me a fair greeting, now turns her face away, or so my wretched mind contrives it. My own heart, a most perfidious judge, doth hold a constant court within my breast, and finds me wanting every hour. Sleep, that should mend the frayed spirit, brings only monstrous visions of my folly, each one a torment sharper than the last, and I awaken to find my own visage in the glass a stranger’s, marked by some foul deed I cannot wash away. I am a walking ghost amongst the living, haunted by the echo of my own betrayal. Tell me, friend, what physic may be found for a soul so grievously self-wounded, when the poison and the wound are one and the same?
