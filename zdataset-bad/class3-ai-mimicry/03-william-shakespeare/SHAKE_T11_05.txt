You ask wherefore I did deny the man his yard of space within this rumbling coach, as though my own poor bones were made of meaner stuff than his. Pray, observe us: he whose purse, being heavy, makes his person light in consequence, and another whose thin cloak spake of a leaner fortune. Yet we are bound by some unspoken law, writ not in ink but in the silent assent of all, that the threadbare knee must bend and the empty hand make way for the bejewelled fist. I tell you, there is a poison in the air we breathe, a pestilence of the eye that judgeth the soul’s worth by the tailor’s stitch and measures a man’s heart by the acres he doth own. My sin, then, was not against the fellow’s flesh, but against his gilded circumstance; I did but for a moment treat a man as a man, and for this high treason against the settled order of things, I am brought to account.
