Mark how my uncle sits enthroned at his own board, his cup o’erflowing and his vestments woven with a merchant’s ransom. A great man, they call him. Yet look you upon his countenance, for there you’ll find no mirth, but only the ghost of it; a hollow pageant played for our benefit. His eyes, which once did hold a merry fire, are now but weary sentinels guarding a fortress of regrets. His own issue, his very sons, speak to him with such caution as they might a winter’s frost, lest their warm breath should crack his brittle humour. He hath built this house of stone, a mighty keep to hold his fortunes, yet in the building of it, he did unmake the humbler shelter of our kinship, leaving love to starve upon the threshold. What profit hath a man to gain a kingdom, if his own heart be its most desolate province?
