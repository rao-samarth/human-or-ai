In this still hour, when naught but the candle’s fearful dance doth move, my mind becomes a court wherein two claimants plead their cause. The first, a grave and sober counsellor, speaks of my sworn bond, a promise writ in ink and sealed with honour’s crest before I knew what foolishness a heart could learn. He argues with cold reason, showing me the ruin that must follow should my name be foresworn and duty left undone. Yet then another voice, a softer advocate, doth rise and speak not of the world’s esteem, but of a private sun that warms my very soul; it questions what good is a gilded cage of reputation if the spirit within must perish for want of light? And so the scales do sway, this way and that, for to choose one is to execute the other, leaving me but half a man, whichever verdict I pronounce.
