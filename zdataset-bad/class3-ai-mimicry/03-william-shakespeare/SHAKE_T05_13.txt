Let all good men here present mark me as forsworn, and cast their stones of judgment as they will. I know full well the solemn pact that tied my fortune to another’s house, a bond of ink and seal meant to secure our fathers’ peace. Yet what am I to do when my very soul rebels against the script? A man may chain his hands, but can he command the heart to beat to a measure it doth not feel? I have looked on duty’s face and found it cold, a mask of virtue hiding an empty chamber where no joy can live. Then, in an unlooked-for hour, a different light did find the window of my spirit, and to deny it were a profanity far greater than the breaking of a man-made vow. So judge my cause; I have betrayed a promise to preserve a truth, for to live a lie in honour’s name is but the most gilded and miserable of sins.
