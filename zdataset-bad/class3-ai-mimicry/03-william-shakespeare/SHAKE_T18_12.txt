The 'two stars' of my lady's eyes he deems a pair of merchant ships, and her 'lips of ruby treasure' a promise of new-found mines!

What a base comedy hath fortune written for us, wherein a lover’s sigh is mistaken for a ledger’s sum, and I, its author, must play the solemn fool and nod as if it were sound reason, lest his fury rise on this tide of error.
