I stood before ye all not a fortnight past, a man of such puffed-up consequence my own boots could scarce contain my swelling vanity. Ay, I did fancy myself a towering oak amongst the common reeds, and took your cautious whispers for the mere rustling of the wind. My counsel was mine own reflection in a polished spoon; a flattering, twisted thing that showed me only what I wished to see. In this glass of self-admiration, I built a castle of high-flown words and promises, a structure with no foundation save the hot air of my lungs. What wonder is it, then, that it should collapse to ruin at the first true breath of fortune's gale? So now I stand here, stripped of that fine mantle of repute, my grand pronouncements turned to a fool’s motley. Look well upon me, my good neighbours, for I am brought so low that the pity in your eyes feels a sharper sting than your deserved scorn, a final, bitter draft for a soul so parched by its own fire.
