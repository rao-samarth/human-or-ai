Hark, what sudden tumult breaks the market’s peace? Master Fitch, that man of sober mien and saintly repute, whose every word was wont to be a balm upon the town’s small griefs, now stands accused; a trembling, cornered fox. The charge is writ not on some dusty scroll but on the weeping face of Goodwife Prynne, whose coin he hath so cunningly purloined behind a veil of pious counsel. See how the mask of virtue, worn for years, doth crack and fall away to show the greedy churl beneath! His fine-spun words, once held as gospel truth, now sound as hollow as a beggar’s drum, and the adoring crowd, so quick to praise, turns now to stone-eyed judges in an instant, their cheers of yesterday becoming curses fit to curdle milk. A goodly apple, rotten to the core, is thus laid bare for all the world to scorn.
