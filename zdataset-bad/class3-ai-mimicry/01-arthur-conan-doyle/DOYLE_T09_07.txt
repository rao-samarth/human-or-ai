My afternoon perambulation beside the park’s placid lake brought me within earshot of a most curious exchange. Upon a bench sat two gentlemen, one elderly and possessed of a calm countenance, the other a much younger man whose features were a study in distress. “But the deed is done, sir,” the younger lamented, his voice low but fraught with a singular burden. “I cannot erase the fact of it, and the knowledge of my error sits upon me like a shroud.” The elder placed a steadying hand upon his companion’s arm. “Nor should you wish to erase it, my boy. That very weight which you now feel is not a condemnation, but rather the clearest evidence of your own sound moral compass. It is the proof that you are a man of principle, and it is upon such a foundation, and no other, that a life of true reparation and greater honesty may henceforth be built. Consider it not your gaoler, but your guide.”
