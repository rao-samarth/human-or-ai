It was with a sudden and most violent lurch that our host, Mr. Abernathy, plunged into the darkened study, his butterfly net—a most incongruous implement for such a nocturnal pursuit—held aloft like some strange heraldic banner. His footman, a stout fellow named Blevins, chose this exact moment to advance from the opposite direction, brandishing the hearth poker with a ferocity better suited to repelling a cavalry charge. The collision was inevitable; its results, calamitous. Abernathy, thrown quite off his balance, reeled backwards into a towering cabinet of curiosities, which descended with the shattering roar of a glass-worker’s nightmare, whilst Blevins, in a desperate attempt to regain his footing, succeeded only in hooking the velvet bell-pull and bringing a cascade of plaster down upon his own head. Through it all, the cause of the disturbance—a small bat of no particular distinction—flitted serenely across the mantelpiece and vanished up the chimney flue, leaving the two men standing amidst the wreckage, a truly ludicrous tableau of foiled ambition.
