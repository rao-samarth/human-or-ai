Sleep has become a stranger to me; indeed, for three nights I have kept vigil over this single brass gear upon my desk. It is a mere trifle, a thing of no apparent worth, and yet it has consumed my every waking thought, a tyrant in miniature. The clockmaker I consulted was adamant—its teeth are cut in a most singular fashion, belonging to no mechanism he has ever encountered. Such a declaration should have been an end to the matter, but for me it was only the beginning. I find myself turning it over and over beneath the lamplight, my meals forgotten, my correspondence unanswered, convinced that the almost invisible scratches upon its face form some deliberate cypher. My colleagues believe a fever has taken my mind, yet they cannot comprehend the terrible logic of it all: for every effect there must be a cause, and this small, impossible object must therefore be the linchpin of some greater, unseen design whose shadow now falls upon my very soul.
