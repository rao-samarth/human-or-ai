Pray, observe for a moment the little drama enacted upon the benches of this public square. One might be tempted to dismiss it all as a parade of trivial falsehoods, yet I perceive something altogether more heartening at play. That young man, with his borrowed phrases and an air of gravity far beyond his years, is not merely posturing; he is, in effect, rehearsing for the man of substance he one day hopes to be. See, too, the woman yonder, whose laughter rings just a trifle too loudly—is it not a brave attempt to convince not only us, but herself, of a joy she is determined to possess? These are not the machinations of a hardened criminal, my friend, but rather the fragile scaffolding upon which a better self is built. It is, when you view it so, a remarkably optimistic business, this universal and quite human aspiration to become more than what one currently is.
