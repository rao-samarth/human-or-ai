Pray, do not trouble yourself with further prevarication, my dear fellow, for the game is most assuredly up. Your entire performance, I must confess, has been admirable in its execution, yet it is a construction built upon the most treacherous of foundations. For three weeks you have played the part of the distraught colonial heir to perfection; the frantic telegrams, the feigned grief—all were quite convincing. But the man I perceive before me now, with the firelight catching the hard glint in his eye, is no such thing. A true gentleman raised in the Indies does not possess hands so curiously unmarked by the sun, nor does he exhibit such a singular familiarity with the locksmiths of Cheapside. No, your true motives here remain a mystery, but the part you have played is at an end. The mask is slipping, and the true countenance beneath—that of a cunning and most determined rogue—is at last beginning to show itself in the tightening of your jaw.
