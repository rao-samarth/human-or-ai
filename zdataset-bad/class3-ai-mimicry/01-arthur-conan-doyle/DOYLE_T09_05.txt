"You have not answered my question, Davies," he said, and the very quietude of his tone carried a greater weight than any heated accusation could have done. It was not his censure I feared, for I had long since become my own harshest inquisitor, passing a solitary and dreadful judgment upon my actions in the dead of night. No, it was the profound disappointment etched upon his features—the expression of a man who has discovered a fatal structural flaw in a thing he had trusted implicitly. Every justification which sprang to my lips died there as a paltry, contemptible thing. A man may well stand against a torrent of fury, but he has no shield for the quiet, sorrowful gaze of a friend whose faith has been irrevocably shattered. I saw then that my deed was not a momentary error to be mended, but a permanent stain upon my own character, a grim spectre that would henceforth stand between us for all our days.
