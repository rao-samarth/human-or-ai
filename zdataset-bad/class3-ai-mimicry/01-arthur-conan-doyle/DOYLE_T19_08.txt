From my vantage point in the bay window of this rather dreary club, the ceaseless river of humanity flowing along the Strand afforded a constant, if somewhat melancholy, diversion. My eye was presently caught by a figure of some distinction—or so it first appeared. He strode with the manufactured confidence of a man long accustomed to playing a part, his tall hat angled at a jaunty, almost defiant, degree. Yet, the discerning observer might note a multitude of trifling inconsistencies that, when compounded, told a vastly different and altogether more pathetic tale. The nap upon his coat-collar, for instance, was worn quite through; the gleam upon his boots was the desperate, watery shine of a cheap blacking hastily applied; and his very gait, for all its bluster, possessed a certain nervous tension which spoke not of affluence, but of the constant, wearing dread of its absence. Here, I reflected, was no captain of industry, but rather a simple clerk clinging to the last vestiges of respectability, presenting a brave front to a world all too ready to cast him aside.
