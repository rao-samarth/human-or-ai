It is a singular truth that the official mechanism of the law, with all its ponderous ceremony and cold deliberation, often falls quite short of what a simple man might call a fair reckoning. Here, amongst the quiet hedgerows and rolling chalk-downs, one is apt to witness a more elemental form of settlement, a matter settled not by a bewigged magistrate in a distant town, but by the very hand that was dealt the injury. The courts, you see, are concerned merely with the letter of a trespass, the cold calculus of a crime; they cannot weigh the hot indignation of a soul that has been wronged. Hence, when I observe a scoundrel, whose cunning has allowed him to slip through the grasp of constables and judges, finally meet with a sudden and most personal form of misfortune—a fall in a darkened lane, a curiously aimed stone from an unseen hand—I confess I perceive not a crime, but a restoration. It is the primitive, and therefore the purest, balancing of the scales.
