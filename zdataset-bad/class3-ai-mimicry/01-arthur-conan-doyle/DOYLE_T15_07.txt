It was with a growing sense of disquiet that I observed the conduct of young Peterson, hitherto the most reliable of our clerks. For a full week his attention had been riveted upon the Consolidated Shipping accounts; a complex matter, to be sure, yet one that ought not to have consumed a man of his faculties to such a singular degree. This morning, however, his diligence had curdled into a most perplexing ritual. He was hunched over his desk not in calculation, but in a kind of frantic artistry, arranging columns of figures into bizarre, symmetrical patterns that had no bearing upon our business. The ledgers themselves lay forgotten. He muttered to the papers as he worked, his breathing quick and shallow, his eyes alight with a fire that was not born of commercial zeal. A grave duty fell upon me then, for to alert the senior partners would surely mean the man’s ruin, yet to ignore this patent decay of reason within our very walls—to allow such a mind access to our clients’ fortunes—was an abdication I could scarcely countenance.
