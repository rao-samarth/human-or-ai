Mr. Abernathy, a portly gentleman whose self-regard was as vast and unplumbed as the ocean itself, was holding forth upon the principles of marine engineering to his fellow passengers. He spoke with the unassailable certainty of one who has read a single pamphlet on the subject and mistaken it for a complete education; his pronouncements upon displacement and ballast were delivered with such gravity that one might have thought him the ship's designer. Indeed, he was in the very midst of a grandiloquent explanation of the vessel’s gyroscopic stabilisers—a subject upon which his ignorance was truly profound—when the ship gave a most unexpected and violent shudder. The effect was as immediate as it was calamitous. One moment, he stood a self-appointed professor of naval architecture; the next, he was but a chaotic jumble of flailing limbs descending into a pyramid of stray portmanteaus, his spectacles askew and his final, authoritative syllable silenced by a mouthful of tweed. The great man’s lecture on equilibrium had concluded with a most practical, if wholly unintended, demonstration of its sudden and total absence.
