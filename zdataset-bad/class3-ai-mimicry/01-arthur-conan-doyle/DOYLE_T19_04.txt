Leaning upon the rail of the cross-channel steamer, I observed how the sun rendered the water into a vast sheet of polished obsidian, a surface so placid as to deceive any but the most seasoned eye. Yet I knew full well that beneath this placid skin there raged a turmoil of unseen currents, a ceaseless and powerful struggle of which the superficial calm gave no hint whatever. It is a phenomenon one sees repeated in our own species, and I found a ready example in the stout gentleman by the davits. He presented the very picture of commercial success and leisurely travel, his waistcoat immaculate, his posture one of easy confidence. A discerning glance, however, would note the incessant, nervous drumming of his right-hand fingers upon the brasswork, and the manner in which his gaze darted towards the receding coastline. These were not the actions of a man at peace, but rather of one for whom this placid journey was but a desperate, final flight.
