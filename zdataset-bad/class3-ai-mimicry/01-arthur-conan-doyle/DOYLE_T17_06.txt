The entire commotion, I have since deduced, arose from a most unfortunate ambiguity of language exchanged in the dark. My host, a man of excitable temperament, had hissed from the landing that a ‘veritable fiend’ was rattling within the larder and that his man, Barlow, should arm himself and see to its immediate dispatch. The man, a fellow of great loyalty but little imagination, took this pronouncement with a terrifying literalness. Hence, I was treated to the singular spectacle of the pantry door being splintered from its hinges by a fireplace poker. What followed was a din of shattering porcelain and clattering tins, punctuated by the grunts of a man engaged in mortal combat with what I could only assume was a badger of considerable size. The culprit, when at last illuminated by a trembling candle, proved to be nothing more than a trapped starling, now perched bewildered atop the ruins of a dozen jars of prize-winning marmalade. My host stood speechless, surveying a scene of destruction that a regiment of soldiers would have been proud to inflict.
