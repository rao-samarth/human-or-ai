As we paused upon the kerb, awaiting a gap in the ceaseless river of hansoms, a portly gentleman of some apparent means fumbled with his gloves and let slip his silver-headed walking stick. It clattered upon the flagstones, and before we could move, a gaunt fellow in a threadbare coat darted forward to retrieve it. "A small kindness, readily offered," I remarked to my companion, for the gentleman received the stick with a curt nod and the press of a single coin. My friend, however, shook his head with a wry smile. "You mistake the matter entirely, my dear fellow," he murmured, his gaze fixed upon the transaction. "Observe the distinction; had you or I performed that service, there would have been an exchange of pleasantries, an obligation created. For that poor soul, the coin is not a reward, but a dismissal—a transaction to instantly dissolve any imagined bond and restore the natural order of things. He has been paid, and therefore, he has been put back in his place."
