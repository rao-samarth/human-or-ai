As this carriage rattles on towards the city, I must confess a certain impatience with your view, for it seems to place all faith in the cold mechanism of the courts. I grant you that the law provides a most necessary bulwark against anarchy, but to mistake its intricate machinery for the very soul of equity is a common, and I might add, a dangerous, error. The wild cry for retribution is one thing—a primal, unthinking impulse which any savage might feel. It is quite another, however, when a man, wronged beyond the reach of any statute, coolly and deliberately exacts a payment which the constituted authorities have failed to secure. In such a singular case, who is to say that his private ledger, so painfully balanced at great personal risk, is a lesser thing than the public one which has proven itself so manifestly deficient? To my mind, there is a profound distinction between the heated fury of revenge and the calculated restoration of a fundamental equilibrium.
