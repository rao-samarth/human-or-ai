I confess that Fleming’s sudden reversal of fortune presented a most vexing problem, not least because our names had been linked in commercial enterprise throughout the parish for a decade. He had a good heart, I shall grant him that, but a good heart does not repay creditors, nor does it rescue a floundering venture from the mire of ill-judged speculation. His frantic appeals for my continued support struck me as a lamentable failure of nerve, a surrender to sentiment where cold, hard reason was required. When old Mr Abernathy made his quiet offer—an offer contingent, of course, upon my severing the prior association—it was not a matter of treachery, as some have whispered behind their hands in the market square. It was, rather, a simple calculation of survival; an unfortunate but wholly necessary amputation to save the whole, and a man who cannot see such logic is a man already lost to the tide.
