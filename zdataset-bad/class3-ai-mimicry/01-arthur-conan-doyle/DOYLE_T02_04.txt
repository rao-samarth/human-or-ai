You must understand, my dear fellow, that the greatest difficulty in any such elaborate artifice is not its initial construction, but its constant and wearying maintenance. A man may fashion for himself a most convincing mask, and indeed, yours was a masterwork of its kind; yet, he must then live behind it, a prisoner to his own creation. Every gesture, every trifling word, every feigned sentiment must be perpetually weighed and measured against the character he purports to be. The strain of this constant performance is a subtle acid that inevitably corrodes the will and frays the nerves. It is a far more taxing endeavour to support a complex falsehood than it is to simply exist in truth, for the honest man has no part to remember. Your entire fabrication, sir, was a house of cards built in a gale—its eventual collapse was not a matter of mere chance, but of inexorable law.
