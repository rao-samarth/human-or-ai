You hesitate, my dear fellow, and I confess I find your reluctance a most singular thing. A fortune awaits us—a veritable escape from this drudgery—for the mere cost of a discreetly worded letter to the right parties. Consider the man we protect! Has he ever shown us a shred of the same consideration when his own interests were at stake? This is not a matter of crude blackmail, you must understand, but rather a simple—and I should say, long overdue—rebalancing of accounts, an adjustment of fortune which circumstances have placed quite neatly within our grasp. But make no mistake; the opportunity is a fleeting one, and should you choose to cling to some antiquated notion of honour, I shall be forced to proceed alone. And you, I fancy, will find your own position considerably less secure in the aftermath.
