Pray, do not misunderstand my silence for admiration, for what I observe is a victory of a most peculiar and lamentable kind. You have reached the summit, yes; your name is now a currency in the highest of offices, a fact which no man can dispute. But I ask you to consider the cost of such a rapid ascent, for it is a matter of simple spiritual arithmetic. With every forward step, was there not a friend left behind, a principle discarded like so much excess baggage? Each rung upon your ladder was, I suspect, built from the timber of another man’s trust—a trust now splintered and worthless. You have constructed a magnificent monument to your own name, my dear fellow, but I fear you are its sole, lonely inhabitant, having burned every bridge that might lead another soul to your door. It is a chilling sort of conquest, to gain the world and find oneself its only citizen.
