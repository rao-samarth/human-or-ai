The commotion which had roused me from my chair was of a most singular nature—a series of frantic thuds from the study, followed by a most ungentlemanly oath. Seizing the nearest object of defence, which happened to be a heavy brass barometer, I crept towards the sound. I flung open the door to a scene of utter bedlam. There, tangled in the draperies, was a stout gentleman I did not recognise, who, in his struggle, had upset a globe of the world which now rolled in a most drunken and erratic fashion about the floor. He had evidently attempted a hasty entry through the window and had misjudged his own considerable bulk. As he gave one final, desperate heave, the curtain rod gave way entirely, depositing him in a heap upon the floor, where he was immediately struck upon the head by the errant globe as it completed its final, fateful revolution. It was a tableau of such comprehensive and precipitous failure that I found myself lowering the barometer, quite overcome by the sheer spectacle of it all.
