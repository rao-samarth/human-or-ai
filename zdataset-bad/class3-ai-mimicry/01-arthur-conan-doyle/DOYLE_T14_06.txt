You speak, my dear fellow, of being the master of your own vessel, and I grant it is a comforting fiction; a notion to warm oneself by on a cold night. But it is a fiction nonetheless. We are but chemical compounds, set into motion by the chance collision of circumstance, and we flatter ourselves with the grand illusion of a rudder. A billiard ball, if it could think, would doubtless congratulate itself upon its keen sense of direction and admirable velocity after the cue has struck, just as you congratulate yourself upon a career in finance which was manifestly predetermined by your uncle’s timely inheritance and a distinct lack of any other marketable talent. This grand drama of human will you so admire is, I assure you, nothing more than a series of such impacts, each one entirely predictable if only one possessed the faculties to observe the initial, trifling push.
