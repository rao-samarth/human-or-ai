My companion in the carriage, a gentleman of some sixty years with the scrupulous bearing of a provincial solicitor, found himself the subject of a most trifling yet public accusation. The conductor, a brusque fellow, had loudly proclaimed a discrepancy of a few shillings in the fare, implying a deliberate attempt at evasion. A lesser man might have paid the difference and dismissed the affair; indeed, it would have been the most expedient course. Yet, I observed this gentleman, with a face pale but resolute, insist upon a full accounting. He demanded the ledgers be sent for at the next station, a process which would delay his journey by a full hour, all to rectify a matter of pocket-change. It was a singular display, for it demonstrated with startling clarity that to a certain class of man, his good name is a possession of inestimable value, before which all practical considerations of time and convenience must invariably fall away.
