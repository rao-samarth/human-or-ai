You may call my actions severe, and I shall not dispute the term; however, I ask you to consider the position in which I was placed. This individual, a scoundrel whose acquaintance I now deeply regret, was circulating a tale so utterly baseless, so venomous in its construction, that it threatened to poison the very well of my public life. It was not merely my own person I had to consider, but the name my father had borne with such distinction, a name I could not permit to be soiled by the foulest calumny. Therefore, I acted. Was the financial ruin I engineered for him a harsh measure? Indeed, it was. Yet, what is a man's fortune when weighed against the very essence of his character? He sought to strip me of something far more precious than gold, and I responded with the only weapon that such a blackguard could comprehend. It was a lamentable business, but one of absolute necessity, for a lie left unanswered becomes, in the eyes of the world, a most detestable truth.
