It was amidst the dreary drone of my cousin’s interminable monologue upon the state of the railways that my attention became irrevocably fixed upon the mantelpiece. There, perched beside the clock, was a small porcelain kingfisher, its beak chipped, its azure glaze dulled by a century of household dust; yet I perceived in its singular imperfection a most urgent and dire communication. Every man in that room, I felt with a certainty that chilled my very blood, was a part of some elaborate charade, and that this silent, broken effigy held the key to its unravelling. Therefore, when a lull in the conversation presented itself, I found it the most natural thing in the world to cross the room, seize the object, and dash it to pieces upon the hearth. My aunt’s shriek was, I confess, a somewhat overwrought reaction, for how else was I to expose the mechanism concealed within, the very mainspring of their collective deceit?
