The undertaking was, in itself, a simple one: to restore a small breach in the ancient stone wall that bordered the lower pasture. My companion, a man more accustomed to ledgers than to labour, approached the task with a grave theoretical precision that proved utterly ruinous in practice. For every stone he painstakingly placed, another seemed to dislodge itself as if by some unseen hand; yet the true agent of our defeat was a single, placid sheep which, with a look of profound indifference, would nudge the base of our precarious work, sending the whole edifice tumbling once more into a heap. After the third such collapse, we simply stood, tools in hand, watching the creature nibble at the very grass that grew where our wall ought to have been. There was little to be said; the sheer, silent victory of the beast over our considered efforts possessed a certain finality that was, in its own quiet way, a more potent conclusion than any we might have constructed ourselves.
