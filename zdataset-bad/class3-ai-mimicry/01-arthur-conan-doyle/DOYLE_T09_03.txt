From my corner of the bustling chophouse, I could not help but attend to the low, urgent conversation of two gentlemen nearby, one whose pallor and trembling hand spoke of some profound agitation, the other a man whose features were set in an unforgiving mask. “It was a single moment of weakness,” the pale one murmured, his voice cracking, “a mere whisper in the wrong ear.” His companion’s reply was a hiss of contempt. “A whisper that has brought a good man to utter ruin!” The first man—the author of this calamity—visibly flinched, his gaze darting about the room as if he feared the very woodwork might cry out in judgment against him. Every clatter of a plate, every burst of laughter from a distant table, seemed to my mind a fresh accusation directed solely at him. He had, by his own admission, unleashed a force he could not recall, and the knowledge of it had become a species of internal poison, for which there could be no conceivable antidote. He was a man not merely regretful, but utterly and irrevocably haunted.
