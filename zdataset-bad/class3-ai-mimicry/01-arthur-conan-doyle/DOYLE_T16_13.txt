We were stood upon the platform at Victoria, amidst the hiss of steam and the great, surging tide of humanity, when the incident occurred. A small child, having wriggled free from its mother’s grasp, tumbled directly into the path of a shunting engine—a dreadful, iron beast which, though moving at no great speed, was yet possessed of a fatal and inexorable momentum. For a single, ghastly second, all was paralysis; I saw a dozen faces contorted with a horror that rendered them immobile. One man in particular, a portly merchant by his dress, took a half-step back, his hand flying to his mouth in a gesture of pure, instinctual self-preservation. It was a third fellow, a slight, unassuming man with the pale complexion of an office-worker, who broke the spell. With a strangled cry, he leapt from the platform, seized the child, and threw him back into the arms of the crowd a mere instant before the wheels passed over the spot—an act not of deliberation, but of some profound, convulsive impulse that had momentarily conquered the most fundamental terror of which a man is capable.
