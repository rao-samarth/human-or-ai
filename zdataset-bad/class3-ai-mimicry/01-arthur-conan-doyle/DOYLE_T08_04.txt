From my window overlooking the ceaseless clamour of the thoroughfare, I have often watched the swift and terrible passions of the multitude ignite over some petty squabble—a pickpocket caught in the act, or a cabman’s dispute grown violent. There is, in that collective cry for immediate satisfaction, a most primal and unthinking force; it is a raw hunger for a balancing of the scales, yet one that is measured by the heat of the moment rather than by any impartial standard. The man who has been wronged desires not that his aggressor be corrected by some abstract principle, but that he should suffer in equal, or indeed greater, measure. It is a dangerous calculus, for when every man appoints himself as judge and executioner based upon the fever of his own injury, the entire edifice of a civilised society is threatened. True equity, I have come to believe, requires a coolness of the head which the victim, by his very nature, cannot possibly possess.
