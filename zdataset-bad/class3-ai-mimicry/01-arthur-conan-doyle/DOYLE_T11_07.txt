You profess surprise that I gave the fellow so cold a shoulder, but you fail to grasp the essential nature of the matter. It was not his unfortunate accent, which time and good company might remedy, nor his rather forward manner of speaking; no, it was something far more fundamental. Did you not observe his boots? They were well-polished, I grant you, but the leather was of a most inferior quality, cracked near the instep and clearly not of a West End make. A man’s entire station, his history and his prospects, may be deduced from his choice of footwear. To feign a position one has not earned is a cardinal sin in this world, for it introduces a fatal element of falsehood. By presenting himself as our equal, he was not attempting to rise, but rather to deceive, and such a man must be put firmly back in his place, lest the very foundations of our ordered world be rendered unstable.
