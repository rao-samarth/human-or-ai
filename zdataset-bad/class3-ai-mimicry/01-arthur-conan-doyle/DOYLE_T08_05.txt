My dear Abernathy, whilst I concede that the summary decapitation of your prize rose is an act of unquestionable barbarity, and that your neighbour Finch is the most likely perpetrator, your proposed course of action—if I understand it correctly, involving a sack of weasels and his new glasshouse—strays rather alarmingly from the path of judicious settlement. You speak of a balanced scale, of a principle ancient and, I admit, viscerally satisfying. Yet, it strikes me that you are not seeking to restore equilibrium; rather, you wish to build a new and more elaborate scale of your own devising, upon which you alone shall serve as the chief weighman. There is a vast and perilous gulf, sir, between the measured hand that rights a wrong and the gleeful one that merely adds another to the tally, and I fear you are preparing to leap across it with the sort of enthusiasm that ends either in the police courts or, at the very least, a most unseemly public commotion.
