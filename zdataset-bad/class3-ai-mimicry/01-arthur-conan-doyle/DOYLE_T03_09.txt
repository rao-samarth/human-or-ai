As the carriage swayed with the rhythm of the iron wheels, my travelling companion expressed some astonishment at the lengths to which our recent acquaintance, a certain Colonel Warburton, had gone to clear himself of a minor but public accusation. I endeavoured to explain that what may seem to a casual observer a disproportionate reaction is, in fact, the only logical course. A gentleman’s good name, you see, is not a mere ornament to be polished or neglected at will; it is the very currency of his life, the invisible contract by which he engages with society. To allow even the smallest stain to remain upon it is to devalue that currency in its entirety. Hence, a man of substance will expend a fortune, risk his station, and face any peril to scrub clean a single blemish, for he understands that the foundation of his whole character is at stake. The fight is never about the trifling incident itself, but about the very right to be believed in all matters henceforth.
