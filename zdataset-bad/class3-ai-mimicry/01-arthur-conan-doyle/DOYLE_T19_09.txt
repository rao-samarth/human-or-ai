My companion, with a subtle inclination of his head, directed my attention towards a most singular spectacle unfolding upon the otherwise placid lawn. A portly gentleman of martial bearing was professing to train a beast of prodigious size, a shaggy brute whose interest lay chiefly in the pursuit of a flitting cabbage-white. With a voice of thunder, the man would cry “Advance!” a full second after the dog had already bounded forward; his command to “Halt!” was delivered only when the creature had found a particularly intriguing scent and stopped of its own accord. Indeed, it soon became manifest that the gentleman’s bellowed instructions were not commands at all, but rather hurried, and somewhat desperate, chronicles of events already transpired. Thus, when the creature finally flopped onto the grass in a fit of panting exhaustion, the triumphant roar of “Assume the position!” was delivered with such profound authority that one might have mistaken the fellow for a hypnotist of rare power, when in truth he was merely a very slow and exceedingly noisy reporter.
