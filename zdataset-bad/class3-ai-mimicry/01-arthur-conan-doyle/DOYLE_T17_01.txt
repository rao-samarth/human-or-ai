What precisely had been said I could not entirely discern, but its consequences were plain enough. With a final, whispered word of such venom that the man physically recoiled, she rose from her chair, and in that moment one could see a future, once bright with promise, extinguished as surely as a snuffed-out candle, all for a meaning carelessly lost between two souls.
