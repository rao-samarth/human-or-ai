There I was, a silent wraith in paisley pyjamas, navigating the upstairs corridor on tiptoe with all the stealth of a cat burglar with an urgent appointment in the master bedroom. A chap might say my motives were not of the purest, but this is where we would part company. When one observes a pop-eyed gherkin like Basil Pottinger-Phipps, a man whose principal charm is his ability to stand upright without assistance, receive a small, promisingly-shaped box from the one girl whose opinion matters, a certain scientific curiosity is naturally piqued. What bauble had this human pudding managed to inspire? It was this quest for pure data, you understand, and not the curious, fizzing sensation behind my waistcoat, that had me applying a well-bent hairpin to his lock. The tumblers gave a soft click. Success! I pushed the door, only to find my entrance blocked by the substantial form of Pottinger-Phipps himself, clad in a dressing gown that screamed of bad taste and fixing me with a look that was distinctly sub-par in the bonhomie department.
