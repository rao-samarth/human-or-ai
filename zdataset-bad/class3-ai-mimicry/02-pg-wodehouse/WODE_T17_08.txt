The entire schism, you see, which now has my Aunt Mildred refusing to pass the cucumber sandwiches to Uncle Percival and threatening to write young Gwendolyn out of her will entirely, began with a simple comment about a potted fern. Percival, meaning only to be chummy, had remarked that the plant looked “a bit of a stoic,” intending, as he later explained with some agitation, to praise its hardy nature in the face of a drafty drawing-room. Mildred, however, whose affections for this particular bit of foliage bordered on the maternal, interpreted this as a slight upon its vitality—a slur, a botanical insult of the first water. From there, the thing snowballed in the most frightful way. Old grievances were exhumed, alliances were forged over the sherry decanter, and by teatime the entire family gathering had acquired the chilly atmosphere of a peace conference where both sides have just run out of biscuits. It’s a dashed rum business, when you think about it.
