My Aunt Maude, a woman whose pronouncements on proper behaviour could make a drill sergeant's bark sound like a maiden's whisper, had been most particular about the reading material for our little continental excursion. "Gaudy mystery stories," she had declared, fixing me with that gimlet eye of hers that I've always felt could curdle milk at fifty paces, "are entirely unbecoming for a gentleman seeking cultural enrichment." In its place, she had furnished a hefty volume on the history of Flemish tapestry-weaving, a thing calculated to send a charging rhinoceros to sleep. So you can imagine my quiet satisfaction when, as the train began its chuntering progress out of Victoria Station, I subtly retrieved from my valise a copy of *The Case of the Pilfered Pekinese*. It was a small gesture, I'll admit, but for a chap who'd been living under the Maude regime for a full week, it felt dashed near to planting a revolutionary flag on a well-guarded fortress.
