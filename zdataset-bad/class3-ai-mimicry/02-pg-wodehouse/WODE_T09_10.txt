It is a rummy business, the way the old inner monologue can turn on a fellow right when he’s hit his stride. Here I was, navigating the human maelstrom of Piccadilly, and all should have been distinctly tickety-boo. The sun was making a brave show of it, and I had, with no little skill, convinced poor old Timothy that sinking his inheritance into Peruvian guano futures was the act of a financial wizard. And yet, was I basking? I was not. A small, insistent voice—the sort of nagging voice that belongs to an aunt who thinks un-buttered toast is the height of riotous living—had begun to pipe up at the back of the cerebellum. It kept pointing out that Timothy would likely be residing on a park bench by Tuesday, which, while technically a consequence of the transaction, seemed a frightfully unsporting thing to dwell upon. It’s dashed inconvenient when a perfectly sound scheme for securing a bit of personal peace is utterly spoiled by one’s own moral compass deciding to throw a tantrum.
