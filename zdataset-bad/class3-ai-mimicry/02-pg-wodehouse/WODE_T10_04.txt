Lady Grimstone had me cornered by the potted palms, and her expression was one a particularly zealous bishop might wear upon discovering a nest of vipers in the collection plate. "So, Frederick," she began, her voice a low rumble that promised no good, "I have been given to understand that you informed my Neville that the 9:15 to Market Snodsbury was, in fact, an express service with no stops." I blinked. Well, I mean to say, I *had* mentioned the 9:15. Rattling good train, usually. What she rather deftly omitted, you see, was the crucial second half of my sentence, which involved the words "except, of course, on Wednesdays, when it stops everywhere to deliver the milk." It was a masterpiece of its kind, really; taking a perfectly sound nugget of information, snipping off the bits that didn't suit, and then polishing the remainder until it shone with the baleful light of incontrovertible proof. To protest felt as useless as trying to teach a garden slug the Charleston; she had her narrative, and poor old Neville, currently stranded somewhere in Lower Bimpleston, was merely exhibit A.
