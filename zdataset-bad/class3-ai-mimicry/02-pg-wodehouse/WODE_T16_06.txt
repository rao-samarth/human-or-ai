It was the sort of strained silence after dinner that usually precedes a particularly vicious round of bridge or a pronouncement from on high that the port is, in fact, corked. The source of the trouble, as is so often the case, was my Aunt Agatha, who had just delivered a withering verdict on young Barmy Fothergill’s new novel, comparing it unfavourably to a railway timetable. One felt that the railway timetable had rather got the better of it. Barmy, a sensitive plant at the best of times, was visibly wilting. It was a moment when a chap’s instinct is to study his cuff-links with an intensity usually reserved for ancient hieroglyphs. And yet, from across the table, little Penelope Spelvin—a girl whose chief contribution to society hitherto had been her uncanny ability to giggle at anything—actually cleared her throat and piped up in Barmy’s defence. It was a gesture of such magnificent, idiotic folly, like a field mouse squaring up to a steamroller, that for a moment I felt a flicker of something akin to admiration, before my better judgement reasserted itself and I went back to considering the polished mahogany.
