The sound from the drawing-room below was a sort of muffled crump, as if a butler had dropped a tray of priceless porcelain after a long and trying day. A hero, I suppose, would have sprung into action, his heart swelling with righteous purpose. But then, heroes invariably end up with a nasty knock on the noggin for their troubles, and what does it get them? A brief mention in the parish newsletter. My own heart, far from swelling, seemed to be attempting to shrink itself into a small, unnoticeable pellet, a feat of anatomical gymnastics I could only applaud. The prudent man, you see, understands that the most gallant act in these situations is to remain perfectly still, preserving the noble bloodline for future, less perilous engagements. The burglar, after all, was merely after the silver; I, on the other hand, was rather attached to my continued existence, a preference the square-jawed chumps of fiction rarely seem to share.
