It is a singularly rummy business, you know, the way a perfectly placid family luncheon can curdle into a full-blown diplomatic incident with the swiftness of a striking cobra. Looking back on the present unpleasantness, I can trace its origins not to some grand transgression, but to my simple, well-intentioned attempt to relay Aunt Dahlia’s feelings about the gravy. Her specific criticism, whispered to me over the roast beef, was that it lacked a certain ‘je ne sais quoi’. A harmless enough bit of feedback, one would have thought, but in passing it along to my uncle—who fancies himself a sauce-maker of the highest order—the message seems to have picked up a rather more sinister spin. Before I knew what was what, he was accusing her of having the palate of a sea slug, she was retorting that his gravy had the consistency of warm tar, and now the two of them are sitting at opposite ends of the drawing-room, communicating only through the glacial medium of my cousin Agatha. One feels, surveying the wreckage of the afternoon, that a chap ought simply to nod and smile and keep his bally mouth shut.
