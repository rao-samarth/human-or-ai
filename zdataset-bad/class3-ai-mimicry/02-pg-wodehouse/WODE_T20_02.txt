My Uncle Theodore, having finished his third glass of port, leaned forward with that confidential air he always adopted before dispensing advice he himself had never followed. He spoke at some length on the subject of moral fibre, of standing firm in the face of temptation, his voice a low rumble of unimpeachable authority. It was all rather moving, in a way, like hearing a sermon on the virtues of a dry climate delivered by a man soaked to the bone. I thought of poor Millie, the parlormaid he’d had to let go last spring for reasons nobody quite liked to mention, and of the rather optimistic figures he’d quoted to the board at the last company meeting. He fixed me with a stern, watery eye, a seasoned general mapping out a campaign of righteousness for a raw recruit, and I felt a profound and weary sort of quiet settle over me, the kind that comes when you realize there’s simply no point in saying a word.
