My dear Biffy, you really must rid your mind of the quaint notion that Lower Bimpole is a haven of rustic tranquility where the most exciting event is a rogue sheep nibbling the vicar's petunias. To the casual observer, I grant you, the place presents a front as placid as a sleeping cat; all thatched roofs, dozing spaniels, and the gentle clinking of teacups. But that, old fruit, is merely the gloss on the patent leather. You see the esteemed Major Fotheringay, the one with the ramrod posture and the voice that could stun a wood-pigeon at fifty paces? He appears to be the very soul of British rectitude, but I have it on good authority that he has been surreptitiously swapping out Lady Pringle’s prize-winning gooseberries for inferior ones from the market, a bally piece of skulduggery if ever there was one. The entire village, I’m beginning to suspect, is a buzzing hive of low-level chicanery masquerading as pastoral bliss.
