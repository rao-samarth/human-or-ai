I mean to say, when a chap gives his word, he gives his word—that’s the bedrock of the whole shooting match, what? And I had, I concede, practically sealed the deal with the formidable Penelope Albright, a girl whose profile could stop a clock and whose views on modern art were enough to curdle the sherry. But what, I ask the assembled body, is a fellow to do when his heart—a previously well-behaved organ, mind you—suddenly performs a sort of giddy somersault in the presence of a certain Daphne who sells carnations and possesses a laugh like tinkling bells? It wasn’t a planned manoeuvre; more of an unforeseen cataclysm, rather like spilling ink on the vicar’s new trousers. One is practically a victim of circumstance, and to hold a chap accountable for the whims of his internal plumbing seems, when you get right down to it, a bit thick.
