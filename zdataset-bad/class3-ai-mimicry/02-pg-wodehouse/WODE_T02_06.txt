Well, if you must have the grim and ghastly truth of it all, old boy, I suppose I must lay the cards on the table, however blotched and unlovely they may be. You see, the whole frightful business began as a harmless sort of jape—a simple, well-intentioned bid to impress young Agatha by claiming a passing acquaintance with the private life of the common frog. A small fib, you might say, but these things have a way of escalating. Before I knew what was what, I was being introduced all over the luncheon car as the world’s foremost authority on aquatic lizards, a position I felt honour-bound to inhabit with as much gravitas as a chap can muster. The snag, and it is a substantial one, is that the *actual* blighter who wrote the book on the subject is currently sipping soup two carriages down, and Agatha is at this very moment forging a path to unite us. It puts a fellow on a distinctly sticky wicket.
