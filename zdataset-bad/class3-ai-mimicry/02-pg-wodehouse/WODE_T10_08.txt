It is a singular business, the way a perfectly sound fact can be trotted out like a prize poodle at a village fête, entirely detached from its less presentable brethren. The recent memorandum from on high, for instance, presented the sales figures with a sort of beaming pride, while neglecting to mention that the profit margin had shrunk to the size of a gnat's waistcoat. One could not, of course, call it an untruth—heavens, no, the numbers were all present and correct. And yet, the effect was precisely the same; for a fact, when paraded in solitary splendour, ceases to be a mere piece of information and becomes, rather, a cudgel with which to beat a fellow into agreement. A singularly effective manoeuvre, one had to admit, though a dashed shabby one.
