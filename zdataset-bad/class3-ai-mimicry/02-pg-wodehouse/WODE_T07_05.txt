It was a simple enough directive, as directives go, and one delivered with all the parade-ground finality for which my Uncle Augustus was justly famed. The small, fluffy miscreant currently making a hearty luncheon of the prize-winning petunias was to be apprehended—pronto—and banished from the premises with a stern word. And yet, as I stood there, clutching the small trowel he’d designated as my weapon, a sort of philosophical stickiness descended upon me. Was it not, I mused, the inalienable right of every rabbit to pursue happiness, even if said happiness involved decimating what the guv’nor called ‘the jewel of the herbaceous border’? To intervene seemed a frightfully high-handed thing to do; a bit of a Caesar-in-the-cabbage-patch act, if you follow my drift. The trowel felt suddenly heavy. One swift lunge, and the law of the manor would be upheld. A quiet retreat to the conservatory, however, and while justice might be flouted, a perfectly decent quadruped would finish its greens in peace. It was one of those rummy spots where a chap’s finer feelings get hopelessly tangled with his urgent desire not to have his weekly allowance docked.
