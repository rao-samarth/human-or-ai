It’s a rummy business, this whole enterprise of pretending you’re something you’re not. Take Aunt Agatha, for instance, currently beaming at old Uncle Roderick with a wattage that could power a small seaside town. One knows for a solid, copper-bottomed fact that she regards him as a first-class chump—she's said as much, with feeling, on numerous occasions—yet here she is, hanging on his every word about begonias as if it were the wisdom of the ages. The strain of it must be frightful. I’ve always felt that maintaining a false front is a bit like trying to teach a cat to yodel; it requires immense concentration, is fundamentally against nature, and is doomed to end in a sudden, noisy, and rather embarrassing collapse. Sooner or later, the mask is bound to slip, and Roderick will find himself on the receiving end of a frank and detailed character analysis, likely starting with his unfortunate choice in waistcoats.
