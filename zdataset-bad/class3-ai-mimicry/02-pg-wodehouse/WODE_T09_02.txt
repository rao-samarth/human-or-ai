Cecil stared at me with the sort of pained expression a man reserves for a bad oyster, and I knew the game was up regarding his silver-plated toast-rack. "I say, old horse," I began, finding the pattern of the carpet suddenly of absorbing interest, "it's this dashed internal monitoring system of mine. It's been kicking up the most frightful row ever since the... ah... incident. It's rather like having a small, terribly conscientious aunt permanently installed in the old bean, tut-tutting and waggling a metaphorical finger every time a chap so much as thinks about a restful night's sleep. She kept me awake for hours, you know, with a point-by-point lecture on the fundamental rottenness of my character, and frankly, a fellow can’t function. One feels as if one's soul has been put through the wringer and hung out to dry in a beastly and most inopportune gale."
