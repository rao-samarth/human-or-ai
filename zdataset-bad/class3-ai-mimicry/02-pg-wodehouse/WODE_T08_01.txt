It was as young Biffy was strolling past the Major’s cottage, morosely contemplating the ghastly ruin of his prize-winning marrow, that the opportunity presented itself. There they were, the Fluting petunias, a riot of nauseatingly cheerful pink, practically begging for a spot of bother. A chap's sense of what was right and proper, you see, gets a bit wobbly when his finest vegetable has been treacherously nobbed with what looked suspiciously like the business end of a walking stick. The scales of what-d'you-call-it—that blindfolded female with the weighing equipment—seemed to be tilting rather alarmingly. One school of thought, championed by the vicar over crumpets just last Tuesday, would advocate for a stern but fair hearing before the Village Committee. But another, more persuasive school of thought, currently making its case with a loud, buzzing noise inside Biffy's own head, suggested that a quiet word with a bottle of selective weedkiller would balance the books far more satisfactorily. The whole question of who gets to be the judge, jury, and executioner suddenly seemed frightfully complicated when the defendant's prize blooms were so temptingly within reach.
