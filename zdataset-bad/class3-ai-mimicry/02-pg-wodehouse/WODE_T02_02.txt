To be perfectly frank, the entire business of presenting myself to the throng as the reclusive modernist painter, Alphonse Dubois, was going down frightfully well—a proper triumph, in fact. My pal Cedric, who’d cooked up the scheme, had assured me the actual Alphonse was communing with nature in the Outer Hebrides and wouldn’t be seen south of Hadrian’s Wall for a twelvemonth. So there I was, nodding thoughtfully and saying things like “Ah, yes, the subtext” to a woman with a hat like a badly-landed parachute. The snag, as is so often the case in these little adventures, appeared from stage left in the form of a small, peppery-looking cove with a beard that seemed to be fizzing with raw emotion. He had fixed me with a glittering eye, the sort of eye a mongoose reserves for a particularly despicable cobra, and was now bearing down on my position by the potted ferns. It occurred to me then, with a sort of cold, sinking finality, that perhaps Cedric’s intelligence on the whereabouts of the Hebrides-communing Alphonse had been, to put it mildly, a trifle faulty.
