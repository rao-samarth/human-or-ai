I say, a young cove with the general demeanour of a wilting lettuce was confiding to his elder on the next bench, "it's been a dashed rummy business, this trying to become a captain of industry. A fellow puts his shoulder to the wheel, you know, burns the midnight oil and all that rot, and before he can say 'what-ho' he finds he hasn't seen a friendly face in a fortnight and his digestion has gone completely to pot. It makes one wonder if the whole bally enterprise is worth the candle." The old buffer, who had a moustache that could have sheltered a small family of birds, merely chuckled. "My dear boy," he boomed, with a heartiness that seemed to shake the nearby pigeons, "that's merely the preliminary invoice before the goods are delivered! One must expect a spot of bother when one is hammering one's masterpiece into shape. It's the trying on of the new shoes before the grand ball—a momentary pinch, I grant you, but think of the triumphant foxtrot that awaits!"
