The auctioneer, a portly cove with the sort of voice that could curdle milk at fifty paces, was extolling the virtues of a rather bogus-looking snuffbox on the podium. It was at this precise moment that the old brain, which had been peacefully snoozing through the consommé, suddenly sat up and started doing vigorous Swedish drills. For there, on a side table currently propping up a half-eaten vol-au-vent, was the *actual* article, the genuine artefact, which I knew from a confidential tip-off was worth a king’s ransom. A lesser man might have wrestled with his conscience; mine, however, simply threw in the towel and went for a brisk walk. With a nonchalance that would have fooled nobody who was actually looking, I executed a swift, crab-like shuffle towards the table. A quick substitution was all that was required—a deft flick of the wrist, a little presto-chango—and the treasure would be mine. The entire operation felt frightfully risky, the sort of thing that usually ends with a chap being hoofed out on his ear by a butler.
