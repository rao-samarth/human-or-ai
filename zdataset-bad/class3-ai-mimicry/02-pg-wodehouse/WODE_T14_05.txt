From my usual perch in the station tearoom, I had for some weeks now made a quiet study of the chap who ran the bookstall, a Mr. Hemlock, whose entire existence, it seemed to me, was a matter of arranging magazines and handing over pennies with a sort of weary precision. Watching him go about his duties, I often found myself wondering if this was the life the poor blighter had sketched out for himself in his salad days—full of derring-do and expeditions to foreign climes, one assumes—or if he had simply been placed there one Tuesday by some unseen hand, like a chess piece, and forgotten about. He never looked at the departing trains, which I always thought was the most telling part of the whole affair. It was a rum notion, to be sure, this business of how a fellow’s grand narrative gets written; whether by a firm hand at the tiller or by the slow, indifferent current that drifts one, quite without one’s noticing, into the quietest of harbours.
