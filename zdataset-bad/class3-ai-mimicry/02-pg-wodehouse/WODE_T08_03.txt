I found myself wishing Cuthbert would take a sip of his sherry, if only to cool the blood, which seemed to be bubbling rather fiercely behind his eyeballs. I mean to say, I was all for seeing the blighter who’d fleeced him get his proper comeuppance—absolutely. But there’s a world of difference, what, between wanting the scales of things properly balanced by the chaps in wigs whose job it is, and the sort of detailed programme Cuthbert was now outlining, which involved a disgruntled goose and the man's notoriously fragile glasshouse. When I ventured to suggest that his notion of a squared account looked frightfully like a fellow simply having a jolly old time getting his own back with bells on, he gave me a look that could have curdled milk at twenty paces. It all gets terribly sticky, this business of deciding who gets to be the judge, jury, and official in charge of the goose. Dashed if I know the answer, but it seemed to me that one path ended with a satisfied sense of order restored, and the other with a great deal of broken glass and a bill for a distressed fowl.
