You ask how things are proceeding at Meadowsweet Manor, old top, and I must report a certain deceptive calm. On the surface of it, all is as tranquil as a sleeping spaniel; a profound hush has descended upon the place, the sort of deep, velvety silence that suggests the entire household is tucked up in its beds dreaming of prize-winning delphiniums and what-not. And yet, for the past hour, a peculiar rhythmic *thump-thump-thud* has been emanating from the guest wing. My first thought was that the boiler had decided to throw in the towel, but a quick investigation revealed something far more unsettling. It was my cousin Algernon, who was supposed to be comatose with exhaustion, practicing his putting against the antique wardrobe with a walking stick and a balled-up sock. It just goes to show, doesn't it, that you can never be entirely sure what’s bubbling away beneath the surface, even when said surface appears as placid as a vicar at a garden fete.
