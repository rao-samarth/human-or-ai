You can always tell the ones who won’t last. Take the new analyst, for instance—sharp kid, I’ll give him that, but he just doesn’t see how the board is arranged. Yesterday, he tried to correct one of the senior partners on a minor data point in the open-plan area, right in front of everyone. He did it respectfully, of course, with a smile, thinking he was being helpful. The silence that followed was heavy. It's not about being right; it’s about understanding who is allowed to be right, and when. Some people just naturally command a certain deference, a kind of gravitational pull you don’t challenge, while others are meant to orbit. He seems to believe merit is a straight line to the top, but he fails to notice the currents that actually move people forward. He’ll either learn to navigate them or he’ll find himself swimming against a tide that was there long before he was.
