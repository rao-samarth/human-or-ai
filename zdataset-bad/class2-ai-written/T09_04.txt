It’s really quite an impressive performance, the one the little warden in my skull is putting on. Bravo. It replays the highlights on a loop, complete with close-ups on the collateral damage, as if I’m supposed to be moved by its shoddy arthouse film. Over by the window, a couple is laughing, probably sharing some vapid story about their weekend, utterly convinced of their own uncomplicated goodness. They should sell tickets. Apparently, this little biological alarm system, this evolutionary holdover designed to keep us from stealing each other’s berries, is supposed to make me a better person. What a production. It feels less like a moral compass and more like a nagging houseguest who keeps pointing out a stain on the carpet you’ve been trying to ignore. All it’s really doing is ruining a perfectly mediocre cup of coffee.
