The whole evening unraveled the moment a waiter, navigating the tight space between tables, caught his foot on a socialite's outstretched leg. His tray of champagne flutes launched into the air like a silver satellite breaking apart on reentry. The glasses rained down on the centerpiece, a ten-foot ice sculpture of a dolphin, shattering with a sound like a thousand tiny, panicked bells. The dolphin, now missing a significant part of its dorsal fin, listed precariously. A man in an ill-fitting tuxedo made a heroic, doomed dive to save it, succeeding only in accelerating its descent onto the pastry table. Amid the spray of cream puffs and shattered ice, a tiny, jewel-collared chihuahua sprang from a nearby purse and began lapping furiously at a puddle of prosecco. The auctioneer, entirely missing the pandemonium, mistook the tuxedoed man’s flailing arm for a bid and slammed his gavel down. “Sold! A slightly damp collection of petit fours to the enthusiastic gentleman in front!”
