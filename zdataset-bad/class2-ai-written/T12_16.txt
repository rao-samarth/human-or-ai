Daniel found me by the terrace doors, away from the low hum of the main hall. “It’s not a favor, it’s just… a nudge in the right direction,” he murmured, his smile not quite reaching his eyes as he adjusted his cufflinks. The clinking of glasses and polite laughter from the ballroom seemed a world away. “A signature. That’s all. The committee follows your lead, and our investors show their gratitude. Substantial gratitude.” I stared past him at the manicured gardens, the perfect rows of flowers illuminated by carefully placed lights. “You’re talking about the waterfront project,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “That land is a public trust.” He gave a slight, dismissive shrug. “It’s just sitting there. Think of what you could build with that kind of capital behind you. A career. A legacy. Or you can stand on principle in an empty room.” The weight of my own crystal glass felt immense, and a cold knot tightened in my stomach as I watched him glide back into the oblivious, glittering crowd.
