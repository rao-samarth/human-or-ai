Uncle Robert was holding court again at the head of the dining table, retelling the story of how he’d won his first business deal with a bold, almost reckless, handshake. It was a story we’d all heard a dozen times, and we all played our parts. We nodded. We smiled. The story was a foundation stone of family lore, a lesson in confident masculinity he expected the younger men to absorb. But then Clara, her fork frozen over her plate, spoke into the comfortable silence after the triumphant conclusion. “That’s not how Grandma told it,” she said, her voice quiet but carrying an undeniable clarity. She said Grandma’s version involved a lucky mistake and a sympathetic secretary, not a heroic gamble. A terrible stillness fell over the room. It was such a needless little prick of a pin to burst the balloon of a perfectly good evening. Some people, I suppose, just need to make everything about them, even if it means correcting a harmless old man’s memory in front of everyone.
