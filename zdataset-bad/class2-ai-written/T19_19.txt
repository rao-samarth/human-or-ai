The whole patio was a chorus of congratulations for my cousin Leo, who was holding court by the grill, retelling the story of his big promotion for the third time. Laughter erupted as he pantomimed his boss's surprise, and I watched him soak up the admiration from our aunts and uncles. He looked so confident, so genuinely deserving of the success everyone was celebrating. I slipped inside to grab another drink and passed the kitchen, where my mom and Aunt Carol were talking in hushed tones. "It's a shame about the other candidate," Aunt Carol murmured, her back to me. "But a favor is a favor, I suppose." My hand froze on the refrigerator door. I looked back through the screen at Leo, now accepting a heartfelt handshake from my grandfather, his smile broad and effortless. Suddenly, the cheerful sounds from the patio seemed hollow, and my own smile felt like a brittle mask I was struggling to keep from cracking under the weight of this new, unwelcome knowledge.
