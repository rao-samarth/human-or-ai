Oh, the great travel bond. They say nothing solidifies a friendship like shared adversity, but I’d argue nothing dissolves one faster than a single, air-conditioned seat in a private car when your bus has broken down in the middle of a sweltering nowhere. Mark kept repeating the mantra, “We’re in this together, man,” but his gaze was locked on that leather upholstery like a man dying of thirst sees an oasis. Suddenly, all our grand pronouncements about loyalty became highly negotiable. You could practically see the frantic calculation behind his eyes: the cost of the seat versus the dwindling value of his integrity. It’s funny, isn't it? The pacts we make in comfort are just fairy tales we tell ourselves until the first real inconvenience comes along. That promise of 'I've got your back' evaporates remarkably fast when the alternative is six more hours stuck to a vinyl seat next to a box of very unhappy chickens.
