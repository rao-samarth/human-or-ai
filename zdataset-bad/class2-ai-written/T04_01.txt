The pressure on the Horizon Project was immense, and whispers of a looming corporate reshuffle had everyone on edge. When the lead developer position opened up, an unspoken rivalry could have easily fractured the team, especially between me and Alex. We had both poured late nights and weekends into the code, and a manager quietly suggested that highlighting Alex’s early miscalculation on the data integration module would certainly put me in the lead for the promotion. It was a tempting shortcut, a quick way to climb the ladder. But when the final presentation came, I found myself doing the opposite. I made sure to credit Alex’s innovative fix for that very module, explaining how his solution was what ultimately streamlined the whole system. The look of surprise and gratitude on his face was worth more than any title. In the end, we presented a united front, and not only did we secure further funding for the project, but we both ended up co-leading the new expanded team. It was a clear reminder that lifting someone else up doesn't diminish your own light; sometimes, it makes it shine brighter for everyone.
