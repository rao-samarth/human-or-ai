The early morning mist was still clinging to the low-lying fields as they walked the property line. For years, every fence post had felt like a link in a chain, binding him to this land his father had left him. He’d always imagined a different life, one far from the predictable cycle of seasons, and when she’d gotten the offer from that firm in the city, he felt the chain pull tight, a familiar ache of a choice he couldn't make. But now, she wasn't packing boxes. She was walking beside him, sketchbook in hand, pointing out how the morning sun hit the old stone walls of the farmhouse. She talked about passive solar and how they could restore the barn into a studio for her, and for him. He watched her pencil move, not designing an escape, but a new beginning, right here. The land no longer felt like an anchor weighing him down, but the solid ground on which they could build something entirely new together.
