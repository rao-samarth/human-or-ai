The ballroom hums with polite laughter and the quiet clink of champagne flutes. From my corner, I watch you move through the crowd, a masterpiece of social grace tonight. Your smile is perfectly calibrated, your anecdotes are charming, and you navigate the shimmering room with an ease that convinces everyone but me. I see the faint tension in your shoulders, the way your eyes briefly lose their focus when you think no one is looking. Each handshake, each hollow laugh is a carefully placed stone in the wall you have so meticulously built around yourself. They see the successful, confident person you’ve presented for the evening. I just see the architect, exhausted from the constant construction, and I feel a quiet ache wondering what it costs you. It’s a profoundly lonely thing, being the only one who knows the person behind the brilliant performance.
