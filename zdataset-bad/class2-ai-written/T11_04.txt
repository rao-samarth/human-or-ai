Oh, it was a masterclass in corporate dynamics, truly. Last month, Mark from Accounts Payable, bless his heart, actually did his homework and proposed a streamlined invoicing system. He was met with the kind of profound silence usually reserved for when the office coffee machine breaks. Henderson, our VP of Synergy, chuckled and asked if Mark had finished his real work before "reinventing the wheel." Then, this morning, Henderson unveiled the "Henderson Efficiency Matrix" to rapturous applause. It was Mark's idea, of course, just repackaged in a slick PowerPoint with more aggressive fonts. Mark just sat there, quietly updating his resume, I imagine, having learned the most important lesson of all: an idea's value isn't in its merit, but in the seniority of the person presenting it. A truly innovative system we've got here.
