No, seriously, you have to admire the sheer artistry of it. I mean, you couldn't choreograph this level of catastrophe if you tried. They hired an officiant who is clearly a life coach he found on Instagram, and he's currently trying to crowdsource the vows from the front row. Meanwhile, the best man, who is already three sheets to the wind, thinks this is the perfect moment to begin his rambling, tearful toast. And the slideshow? The one meant to showcase their romantic "journey"? It's currently stuck on a loop of photos from Todd’s 2012 spring break trip, which seem to heavily feature a beer bong. It's not just a disaster; it’s a beautifully composed symphony of bad decisions. I'm not even mad, I'm just impressed.
