I’m leaning against the back wall of the town hall, listening to Mayor Thompson wax poetic about the historical accuracy of the proposed new lampposts. He keeps using the word “authenticity,” which is rich coming from a man who drives forty minutes to the superstore every weekend. Outside, the actual historic sidewalk is a mosaic of cracks and weeds, a real hazard for anyone not paying attention. But no, we need expensive, faux-gaslight fixtures to "preserve our unique character." The best part is seeing Martha Gable, who runs the bookstore, nodding so enthusiastically. She complains constantly about people buying online, yet here she is, applauding a plan to spend the town’s entire maintenance budget on fancy decorations instead of, say, fixing the very pavement that might trip her few remaining customers. We all just agree to polish the frame while ignoring the picture itself.
