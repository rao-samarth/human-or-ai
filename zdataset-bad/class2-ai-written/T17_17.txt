It all started, as these things always do in Harmony Creek, with a completely innocent remark. Jerry, bless his simple heart, suggested the neighborhood watch should "keep an eye" on the new folks in the Peterson house, probably meaning they should drop off a casserole. But Carol Gable, whose hearing is as selective as her charity, heard "keep an eye on" and immediately translated it into "they're running a meth lab." A real pillar of the community, that Carol. It took less than a week for the rumor to evolve. First, it was drugs. Then, it was witness protection. By Friday, the consensus at the diner was that they were avant-garde artists from the city, which, for some here, is far worse. The Millers packed up and left before their lawn was even fully green, probably baffled as to why their welcome wagon consisted entirely of suspicious glares and drawn curtains. Another triumph for small-town vigilance.
