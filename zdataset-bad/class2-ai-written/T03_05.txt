The clatter of the cafe was deafening until it wasn't. Suddenly, all I could hear was the sharp gasp and the man pointing directly at me, his briefcase now sporting a dark, steaming stain from a stranger's spilled coffee. "He bumped my arm!" the spiller insisted, his voice rising over the hiss of the espresso machine. I hadn't moved. I could have just slipped out into the river of people flowing down the sidewalk; in a city this big, who would ever know? But the accusation hung in the air, thick and sticky. Every eye was on me. So, I took out my wallet, peeling off a couple of bills and placing them on the table for the man with the stained briefcase. It wasn't my fault, not even a little, but letting that lie stand felt like a bigger price to pay than twenty bucks for dry cleaning. I had to walk out of there with my own story straight, even if only for myself.
