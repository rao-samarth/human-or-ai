I caught my reflection in the dark glass of a skyscraper and, for a second, I almost believed it. The sharp coat, the purposeful stride, the practiced half-smile that said *I belong here*. It’s a full-time job, really. The real me is a chaotic mess of missed calls and overdue bills, but this version? This version is going places, navigating the river of bodies on the pavement with an assurance I have to actively invent each morning. The city is a perfect stage because no one looks too closely. But sometimes, walking through this sea of strangers, I get this cold spike of fear that someone I actually know—someone from my old life—will spot this carefully constructed stranger and call out my real name. The weight of the whole performance just presses down, and I have to duck into a coffee shop just to breathe and remember who’s actually underneath it all.
