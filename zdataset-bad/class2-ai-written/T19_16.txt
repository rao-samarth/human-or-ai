Oh, look at Mark, handing out compliments in the team meeting like they’re free samples. 'Incredible synergy, everyone!' he chimes in, fifteen minutes after privately messaging me that my proposal was a non-starter. He’s the office golden boy, the one who organizes the charity bake sale and remembers everyone's work anniversary with a painfully cheerful email blast. To the bosses, he’s the enthusiastic engine of the whole department. What they don't see is that this engine runs on the fuel of other people's ideas, quietly taking credit while meticulously documenting their smallest mistakes for later use. He'll cc the entire leadership team on a minor win he barely touched, but suddenly develops amnesia when you ask for the data he promised you last Tuesday. It’s a masterclass in professional maneuvering, and you almost have to respect the sheer, unadulterated gall of it.
