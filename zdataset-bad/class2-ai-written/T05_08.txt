You wouldn’t believe this place. My uncle is telling that same story about his fishing trip, the one where the bass was supposedly the size of a toddler, and everyone is laughing on cue. In about ten minutes, I'm supposed to stand up and give the toast for my parents' anniversary. I've been rehearsing it for a week, but right now, the only words in my head are the ones you said as I was leaving your apartment this morning. My thumb keeps tracing the edge of the notecards in my pocket, the corners getting soft from the nervous friction. I’m smiling and nodding, a perfect picture of the devoted daughter, but it all feels like watching a movie of someone else's life. Every polite laugh and clinking glass just makes me wish I was back in the quiet of your kitchen, where nothing needed to be performed.
