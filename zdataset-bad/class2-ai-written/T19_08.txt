You asked how things are back here, and honestly, it’s mostly the same. Everyone still treats old Mr. Henderson from the pharmacy like a saint, just because he remembers everyone's name and gives kids free lollipops. You’d think he was the soul of this town, the way people talk. But the other day, I was in line behind him at the grocer’s, and the young cashier made a small mistake, charging him for two bags of apples instead of one. The look he gave her—it wasn't anger, just this quiet, chilling disappointment that made her shrink right into her uniform. He didn't say a word, just let the silence punish her. No one else seemed to notice, but it made me realize that the friendly face someone shows the world is often just the most convenient one.
