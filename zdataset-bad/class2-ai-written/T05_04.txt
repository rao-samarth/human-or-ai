"You're a million miles away," my cousin Chloe said, leaning against the porch railing next to me. The smell of charcoal and cut grass hung heavy in the humid afternoon air, punctuated by the shrieks of children playing tag across the lawn. I followed her gaze to where my husband, David, was flipping burgers, laughing easily with my father. He looked every bit the perfect partner, the perfect son-in-law everyone believed him to be. "It’s not fair to him, you know," Chloe continued, her voice low. "Or to yourself." I just shook my head, tracing a pattern on the condensation of my glass. "What am I supposed to do?" I whispered, the words barely audible over the music. "Walk away from this? Destroy all of it because my heart decided to wander? My parents, his parents, the life we built... everyone is depending on this picture being real. Sometimes, upholding the promise you made is just more important than the happiness you think you've lost." She didn't have an answer. Nobody ever did.
