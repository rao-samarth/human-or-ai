The plan to get through the train station with military precision imploded the second a rogue pigeon dive-bombed Dad’s ice cream cone. He yelped, stumbling backward into a rolling luggage rack, which then careened silently toward the express platform. My sister, trying to stop the rack, slipped on the splattered mint chocolate chip and spun directly into a street performer playing a pan flute, who let out a startled, discordant squawk. Meanwhile, the luggage rack, now gathering speed, gently nudged the emergency stop button for the entire departure board. Every screen went black. A collective groan echoed through the terminal as we all stood there—Dad covered in ice cream, my sister tangled up with a musician, and a single, triumphant pigeon pecking at its prize in the sudden, profound silence.
