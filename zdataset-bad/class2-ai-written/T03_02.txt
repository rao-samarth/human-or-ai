The vendor's shout cut through the platform's clamor, his finger jabbing in her direction. She didn't understand the words, but the accusation was universal, and a ring of silent judgment formed as faces turned. Just then, the piercing shriek of the train whistle—her train—sliced through the air. The final call. Every instinct screamed to run, to sprint for the closing doors and leave the false charge hanging in the diesel-tinged haze. No one here knew her. It wouldn't matter. But her feet felt bolted to the grimy concrete. With a sharp intake of breath, she turned back to the vendor, slowly and deliberately opening her wallet for the small crowd to see. The steam hissed as the carriages began to pull away, but she stood her ground, unmoving, ready to miss everything just to prove she was not a thief, not even to strangers she would never see again.
