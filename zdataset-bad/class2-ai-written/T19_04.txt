The air hummed with laughter and the clink of silverware against porcelain. Around the long dining table, my family presented a perfect portrait of contentment: my aunt recounting a funny story from work, my uncle nodding with a broad, practiced smile, and my cousins chiming in with enthusiastic agreement. Yet, I knew the intricate web of unspoken truths that held this fragile scene together. I knew my uncle's business was on the brink of collapse and that my aunt’s cheerful anecdotes were a well-honed defense against her own anxieties. We were all participating in a necessary fiction, a carefully constructed agreement to ignore the fractures running just beneath the polished surface. Perhaps this collective performance wasn't a lie so much as a different kind of truth—the willful creation of a shared, peaceful moment, however temporary and illusory it might be. We would hold this image of unity until the car doors closed, and then the real world, with all its sharp edges, would rush back in.
