The blue light of the phone screen was the only thing illuminating the bedroom at two in the morning.

Saffron had a sponsorship deal with a brand of organic, gluten-free kitty treats. Bartholomew had recently eaten half a spider plant and then thrown it up on a charging cable. It wasn't Mark's fault, of course, but a bitter little question still formed in the darkness: why did *his* cat get the modeling contract while mine was perfecting the art of the projectile hairball? Bartholomew grunted in his sleep, a sound not unlike a clogged drain, and the question answered itself.
