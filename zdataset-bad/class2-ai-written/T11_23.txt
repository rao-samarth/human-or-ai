The fatal mistake Brenda made at the town picnic was bringing a plastic tub of onion dip and a bag of store-brand potato chips. She placed it on the gingham-covered table with a cheerful, oblivious smile. Mrs. Gable, whose family had basically founded the town and never let anyone forget it, didn't even flinch. She just gently repositioned the offering to the far end of the table, next to the paper napkins, as if it were a biohazard. Later, while slicing her famous four-layer Jell-O salad, she explained the system to me in a hushed, instructive tone. Chips, she clarified, were for high school football games. A proper picnic contribution required at least one can of condensed soup or, for the truly ambitious, a homemade vinaigrette. "She just doesn't know any better, poor dear," Mrs. Gable whispered, giving a pitying glance toward Brenda, who was now trying to get her toddler to stop eating dirt. The tub of dip remained a lonely, untouched monument to her miscalculation.
