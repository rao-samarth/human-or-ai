Please, just stop looking at that framed photograph and look at me. I know what he would have wanted; his expectations have been the wallpaper of my entire life, a constant pattern I was meant to fit into. You talk about my commitments, about the plan we all agreed to when I was nineteen and thought honor was the most important thing a person could possess. But that was before. Before I understood that some obligations are just gilded cages, built by people who love you but don't truly see you. What I have with her is quiet and inconvenient and everything this family was built to oppose. It has no inheritance, no strategic advantage. But when I'm in that small, cluttered apartment, I can finally breathe. Calling this a betrayal is the easy way out for you. For me, staying here, putting on that suit and that smile one more day—that would be the real treachery.
