You wouldn't believe this place, all gleaming silverware and the low murmur of important conversation. I’m playing the part perfectly, just as we rehearsed. They all see the woman we invented, the one with the easy smile and the family history I memorized from a book. But then my heart just about stopped. Across the room, I saw Mr. Abernathy from the old corner market, the one who used to give me day-old bread. He didn't even blink, just looked right past my silk dress to the server with the canapés. I swear, for a second, I thought the whole elaborate house of cards would come tumbling down around me. It’s a strange relief when they don’t recognize you, but it’s also terrifying. It's exhausting, holding your breath for so long, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up before I forget how to breathe at all.
