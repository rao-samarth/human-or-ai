The entire collapse began with a single, misplaced letter. A junior associate, hurried by the constant blare of traffic from the street below his office window, typed "can't" instead of "can" in an email authorizing the final wire transfer. The message, stripped of inflection and context, landed in an inbox across town with the blunt finality of a court order. The recipient, already on edge from a week of tense negotiations, didn't call to confirm the shocking reversal. Instead, he forwarded the message to his partners as proof of bad faith. Within an hour, lawyers were being summoned and public statements were being drafted. By the time the associate noticed his typo, scrolling back through his sent folder during a late lunch, the partnership had been publicly dissolved, two corporate reputations were in tatters, and a decade of collaboration had been undone by a simple, three-letter word mistaken for its opposite.
