The disembodied voice from the ceiling chimes in to announce another station we won't be stopping at. It's amazing, really, what people will praise. They all want the express route, celebrating the speed while conveniently ignoring that the countryside has been reduced to a nauseating, featureless blur. Remember all those quaint little towns—each with their own little moral convictions—that you promised you’d visit? They’re just smudges on the glass now, indistinct from the last dozen you sacrificed for the sake of a better arrival time. Of course, the real trick is to convince yourself that this sterile, first-class quiet is the actual prize, not the vibrant, noisy places you deliberately skipped. The legroom is fantastic, though. You have to give them that.
