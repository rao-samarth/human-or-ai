In the old cemetery overlooking Braxton Creek, the town's unwritten rules are carved in stone. You can map the entire social landscape without ever meeting a soul. The Hendersons and the Clarks rest on the highest point of the hill, their granite monuments like silent sentinels, their legacy assured by altitude and sheer mass. Below them, arranged in neat, respectable rows, are the merchants and the farmers, their names still known in town. But as the slope flattens out towards the woods, the markers shrink, becoming simple, weathered slabs, some with names barely legible. In the farthest corner, where the wild grass grows untrimmed, there are only fieldstones, anonymous and forgotten. It makes you wonder if we ever truly escape the positions we're assigned. Even in this final, quiet democracy of dust, the land itself seems to remember who was who, preserving an order that the living only pretend to ignore.
