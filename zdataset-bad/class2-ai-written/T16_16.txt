But then he laughed, that smug, self-satisfied sound that always set my teeth on edge, and something inside me just hardened. I put my untouched champagne flute down on a passing tray with a quiet clink. My feet felt like they were moving through wet cement, but they were moving, carrying me straight toward him through the glittering, oblivious crowd.
