You keep saying ‘just try harder,’ but you don’t understand that we aren't playing the same game. It’s not just about effort. It’s about knowing which doors are even there to be knocked on, about having a safety net that isn't just wishful thinking. You grew up speaking a language of quiet confidence that I had to learn from scratch, and I’m still faking the accent. Every single room I walk into, I feel like I'm on high alert, terrified I'll use the wrong fork, laugh at the wrong joke, or reveal that my parents didn't have a ‘summer place.’ You see a ladder you can climb; I see a series of locked gates where everyone else seems to have been given a key at birth. So don't tell me about a level playing field. We’re not even in the same stadium.
