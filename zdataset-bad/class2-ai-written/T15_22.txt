You wouldn't believe me if I told you what I've been doing. It started with a sound, a faint humming from the wall behind the bed, only audible after midnight. At first, I thought it was the pipes, maybe the refrigerator downstairs. I turned off every breaker in the house, but it was still there. It’s not a machine sound; it’s more like a frequency, a single, unwavering note that has burrowed into my skull. Last night, I couldn't take it anymore, so I got the utility knife. I've cut a small, neat square out of the drywall, just to see what's inside. There's only insulation and wood, of course, but now the sound seems louder, and I’m sure if I just make the hole a little bigger, I'll finally find where it’s coming from.
