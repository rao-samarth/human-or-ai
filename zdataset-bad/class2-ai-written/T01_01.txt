The clatter of forks and muffled laughter from the dining room seemed a universe away from the quiet study where David stood. His brother, Mark, was holding court, regaling their cousins with stories of his latest corporate takedown, his new watch flashing under the dim light. Everyone saw the gleaming peak he’d reached, the result of a relentless, single-minded climb. But David just saw the trail of wreckage. He remembered the “necessary” layoffs that included their uncle, the broken promises to old partners, the hollow look in Mark's own son's eyes when his father missed yet another game for a last-minute flight to Singapore. He raised his glass in a silent, bitter toast from the doorway. Mark had gotten everything he’d ever chased, but in his ascent, he’d forgotten that the people you step on to get to the top are the same ones who might have once held the ladder for you. He had the summit, but he was completely, utterly alone up there.
