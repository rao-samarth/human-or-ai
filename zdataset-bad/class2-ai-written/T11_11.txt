I tried not to listen, but her words were magnetic. “It’s because their parents speak a language we haven't learned. A language of quiet nods and summer homes, of knowing the right person to call for the right favor. They don't have to say ‘you can’t play here.’ They just build a wall without any bricks, and they don't even know they've done it.” She stroked his hair, her knuckles white. “And we’re left on the outside, wondering what we did wrong, when the only thing we did was show up.”
