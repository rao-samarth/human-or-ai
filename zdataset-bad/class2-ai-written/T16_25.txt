The alley was narrower than it looked from the main street, and the fading light didn't do much to make it feel welcoming. I was just about to turn back when the man ahead of me, broad-shouldered and walking with a heavy gait, fumbled with his pocket. A dark leather wallet slipped out and hit the cobblestones with a soft, final thud. He didn't notice. But a group of guys leaning against a doorway a few paces down certainly did, and they started to shift. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat telling me to just walk away, to mind my own business in a city where I was a complete stranger. Every rational instinct screamed that this was not my fight. But I couldn't. Before I could fully process the risk, my feet were moving, closing the distance. My hand was shaking as I scooped it up, the worn leather cool against my skin.
