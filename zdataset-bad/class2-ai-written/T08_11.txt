The only sound was the low hum from the kitchen, a constant companion to the late-hour silence. On the table, the letter lay flat, its official letterhead seeming to absorb the dim lamplight. They called it a resolution, a final balancing of the scales. Years ago, all I had wanted was a reckoning, a simple, brutal equation where their pain would equal mine. A pound of flesh for a pound of grief. But this… this was something else entirely. It was a cold, methodical process, navigated by strangers in suits who spoke of statutes and precedents, not of loss. They had decided what was fair, what was a proportionate response. And now, sitting here in the stillness, I wonder if what they delivered was a form of equity or just a civilized way to get even, a sanitized act of retribution that left everyone feeling hollow and nothing feeling right. The house gave no reply.
