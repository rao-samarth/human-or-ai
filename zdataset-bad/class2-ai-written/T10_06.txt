The only sound in the house was the low hum of the refrigerator, a steady, indifferent noise in the deep of the night. I stared at him, sleeping so peacefully in the pale moonlight slanting through the blinds, and felt a cold dread crystallize in my chest. It wasn't one big lie that had broken me; it was the thousand little omissions, the carefully curated stories, the facts presented just so. Each one, on its own, was plausible, a slight misunderstanding. But here, in the suffocating quiet, I saw them all laid out like a map of my own captivity. He hadn't built my prison with bars and locks, but with his version of events, a reality he shaped for me day by day. He’d hand me a single, polished stone of information and tell me it was the whole mountain. And I had believed him. The man breathing softly beside me was not my partner, but my architect, and the world he had constructed for me had just shattered.
