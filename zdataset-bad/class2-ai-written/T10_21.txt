The glow from the phone’s map cast a pale, accusatory light across her face. “This isn’t the road to the coast,” she said, her voice quiet but leaving no room for argument.

It was just like the ‘forgotten’ phone call from his old friend, or the ‘unexpected’ bill he’d paid without telling her. You don’t present the whole truth, do you? You just select the facts you think I need, arranging them into a story that leads exactly where you want to go. He finally glanced at her, his smile tight and brittle. “I was planning a surprise. You’ve ruined it now.”
