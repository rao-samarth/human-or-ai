The wood chips at this park always smell like rain, even on a sunny day. I was half-watching my son try to master the big slide, half-listening to the two moms next to me. One was saying how exhausted she was, that her toddler had been up three times the night before. The other one sighed in sympathy. “I know that feeling,” she said. “Our night nanny’s contract just ended, and the transition has been absolutely brutal.” She went on, talking about the difficulty of finding a replacement with a proper Montessori certification, all while the first mom just nodded, her face a perfect mask of polite understanding. It wasn't said with any malice, just a casual statement of fact from a world operating on a completely different set of assumptions. Suddenly, my own worries about getting the grocery shopping done felt incredibly small, like a problem from a different planet entirely.
