The man across the aisle had been making me nervous for the last hour. His knuckles were scarred, his jacket frayed at the cuffs, and he stared out at the passing countryside with a fixed, unreadable scowl. When the young family boarded at the last stop, their toddler immediately started a high-pitched wail that grated on everyone's nerves. I saw the man’s jaw tighten and I braced myself, my hand hovering near my bag, ready to just get up and move carriages if he snapped. But he didn't. Instead, he reached into his own worn duffel and pulled out a small, crudely carved wooden horse. He simply held it up. The crying stopped instantly as the child’s eyes locked onto the toy. He gave the relieved mother a brief, almost shy nod before sinking back into his seat, the scowl returning as if it had never left. I just sat there, feeling a hot flush of shame for the character I had so quickly and confidently written for him.
