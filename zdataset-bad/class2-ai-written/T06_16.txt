The train rocked gently, blurring the Italian countryside into a smear of green and gold. Leo was asleep in the seat opposite, his face relaxed, untroubled. That was the thing about him: everything seemed so simple, a charmed life of easy laughter and opportunities that just fell into his lap. Then I saw it—his worn leather wallet, halfway under his seat, having slipped from his pocket. A sour, hot knot tightened in my gut. It would be so easy to just leave it there. Or to nudge it farther away with my foot. To watch the frantic search later, to see that perfect composure finally crack and for him, just once, to need my help, to not be the one in control. The thought was ugly, a creeping shadow in the bright afternoon. I leaned forward, my hand hesitating for a fraction of a second before I picked it up and quietly slid it back into his jacket pocket. He didn't stir, and the train kept moving, but the bitterness of what I'd almost done lingered long after the wallet was safe.
