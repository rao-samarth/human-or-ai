The sound was so small, a single sharp crack from the kitchen below, that it might have been nothing. A settling floorboard. The refrigerator's ancient complaint. But then came the silence, a heavy, listening quiet that felt entirely different from the usual stillness of the house at 2 AM. My heart began to hammer a frantic rhythm against my ribs, a trapped bird desperate for escape. Every shadow in the hallway seemed to lengthen and writhe. Hiding under the covers felt like the only sane option, a primal urge to disappear and let the danger pass by unnoticed. But the image of my daughter sleeping in the next room, oblivious and vulnerable, sliced through the panic with crystalline clarity. My hand, slick with a cold sweat, closed around the heavy glass lamp on the nightstand. The decision was made not with a thought, but with a deep, shuddering breath as my feet touched the cold floor. I was moving before I even knew I could.
