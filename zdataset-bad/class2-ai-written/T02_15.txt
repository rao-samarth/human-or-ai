You have to admire the sheer commitment, really. There go the Hendersons, parading down Main Street in their coordinated pastels, beaming at everyone as if they just stepped out of a catalog for aggressively happy people. They are, of course, Maple Creek’s aspirational power couple. What a performance. It’s almost enough to make you forget that half the neighborhood heard her screaming through an open window about a second mortgage last month, or that everyone saw his truck parked outside the motel on Route 9 two weekends in a row. But here, we prefer a tidy narrative, a pleasant picture to hang on the wall of our collective consciousness. The truth is messy and inconvenient, and it doesn't look good in the town newsletter. So we nod, we smile back at their flawless, brittle faces, and we all quietly wait for the finale.
