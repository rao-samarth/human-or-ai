The polite applause filled the ballroom, a soft, rhythmic tide against which my own heart hammered a frantic, irregular beat. Mr. Henderson’s name echoed from the speakers, and I watched him rise, a practiced smile already fixed on his face. Two tables over, young Anya stared down at her plate, her shoulders slumped, the vibrant color of her dress suddenly looking like a cruel joke. I knew the truth behind the project he was being honored for; I saw her late nights, her scribbled-on napkins, her quiet genius. A cold wave washed over me, a physical sensation of dread that made my palms sweat. Every instinct screamed at me to stay seated, to just be another face in the applauding crowd, to let this moment pass. But the sight of Anya’s defeated profile was an anchor, pulling me down into a place where silence was no longer an option. My chair scraped against the polished floor, a sound far too loud in the sudden pocket of stillness I had created for myself.
