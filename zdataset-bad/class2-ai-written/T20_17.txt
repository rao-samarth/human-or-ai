Okay, yes. I know what this looks like, with the blue light painting my face at two in the morning while my book on mindful living gathers dust on the nightstand. But this isn't what you think it is; this is competitive analysis. Do you have any idea how many other wellness gurus are posting about the exact same sunrise right now? I have to monitor their engagement, track their hashtags, and ensure my message about the virtue of unplugging is cutting through their noise about the virtue of unplugging. It’s a digital battlefield for analog peace, and someone has to be online, fighting for everyone else's right to be offline. My post about ‘finding serenity in a screen-free hour’ is getting incredible traction, and it would be irresponsible not to nurture that conversation. So, no, I’m not just scrolling through feeds. I’m a sentinel.
