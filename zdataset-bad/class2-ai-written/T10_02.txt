I’m standing near the back of the ballroom, nursing a glass of sparkling water and watching my department head, Julian, hold court with one of the VPs. It’s almost impressive, in a way that makes my stomach clench. He’s recounting the Q3 rollout, a project I know for a fact nearly imploded because of a budget oversight on his end. But you wouldn't know it from his version. He’s cherry-picking data points, framing our frantic, last-minute fixes as a 'dynamic response to shifting market conditions.' He even uses my team’s late nights as proof of our 'unwavering commitment' rather than what it was: a desperate scramble to correct his mistake. He isn't lying, not exactly. Every fact he presents is technically accurate. But the story he builds from them is a complete fiction, a carefully curated highlight reel designed to make him look like a hero, and the VP is buying every single word.
