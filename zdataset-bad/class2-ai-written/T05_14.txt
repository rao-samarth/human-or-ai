I’m writing this from the porch swing, watching the last of the sunlight fade behind the old oak tree. Out here, everything feels so permanent—the worn wood beneath my hands, the smell of damp earth, the way the night birds begin their calls at the exact same moment every evening. You asked me to imagine a different life, one with you, far from all this predictable stillness. I do. I see it so clearly sometimes that it feels like a memory. But then I walk past my mother’s garden, the one she can’t tend to anymore, or I hear my father coughing in his sleep through the thin bedroom wall, and the fantasy shatters. They built their entire world on the promise that I would be here to catch them, a promise I never made with words but have lived my entire life. Choosing you feels like a beautiful, selfish betrayal of the only world I've ever been taught to protect.
