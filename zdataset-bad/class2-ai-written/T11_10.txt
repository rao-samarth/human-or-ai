The sudden downpour fractured the crowded street into two different worlds. From the dry warmth of the cafe, I watched people scatter. Some, with effortless grace, were swept into the glowing entrances of designer stores, doormen rushing to shield them with oversized umbrellas. Inside, they’d shake off a few stray drops from their cashmere coats, their laughter muffled by the thick glass. But just across the pavement, another group huddled beneath the dripping awning of a shuttered newsstand. They pressed themselves against the cold metal, shoulders hunched, pulling thin jackets tighter as the rain soaked through their shoes. There was no shared glance between the two groups, no acknowledgment. It was as if a sheer, invisible wall had descended with the rain, a barrier more solid than any brick or stone, defining not just who found shelter, but who was even allowed to seek it. The casual, unthinking privilege on one side and the weary resignation on the other felt like a quiet, brutal violence.
