The only sound in the dark was the faint hum of the refrigerator. She was asleep, of course, her breathing a slow, even rhythm against the silence. There was a little smile on her face, the kind you see on people in commercials who don’t have to worry about the rent check or the way their boss looks at them when they speak. She was probably dreaming of that trip she took before we met, the one her friends are always bringing up with such casual admiration. It’s so easy to be content when your past is full of those moments. Her smile isn't one of peace; it’s a sign of a completely different life, a private world built from experiences I’ll never have. She's off in that world right now, and I’m just the person who lies awake beside her in the dark.
