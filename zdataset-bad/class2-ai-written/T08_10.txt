I know you saw me walk away from Uncle David by the grill just now, and I couldn't listen to him go on anymore about the Henderson lawsuit. He talks about making them "pay" with such satisfaction, as if their ruin is the only acceptable price for what they did. But listening to him, I kept thinking it's not about balance for him; it's about winning, about inflicting a hurt as deep as the one he feels our side of the family received. He sees it as evening the score, but I just see it as starting a new one. It's so easy to confuse the two when you're the one who feels wronged, isn't it? To believe your own anger is the truest measure of what's right. I guess that’s the part that scares me—how quickly a desire for fairness can curdle into a simple thirst for more pain.
