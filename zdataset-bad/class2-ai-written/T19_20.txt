The moonlight sliced through the blinds, striping the living room in silver and grey. Framed photos on the mantelpiece caught the light, freezing our smiles from a dozen different holidays, each one a perfect moment of curated joy. The air was still, smelling faintly of the lemon polish I’d used that afternoon. But the quiet wasn't calm; it was a held breath. Every object in this carefully assembled stage—the plumped cushions, the neatly stacked magazines—felt like a brittle, elaborate lie. Upstairs, I knew he was awake, just as I was, the space between us in our bed a silent, screaming canyon. Those smiling people in the frames were strangers, actors from a play whose final, bitter act had been written long ago. We were just living in the set now, two ghosts haunting the beautiful shell of a life, waiting for the lights to finally go down.
