You ask me if I regret it, and the answer is no. Every day, I watched them from my window, heads down, moving to the ceaseless hum of the transit lines and the glow of a thousand screens telling them what to want. They called it order, this seamless flow of humanity from one designated box to another, never questioning the current that pulled them along. My action wasn’t about creating chaos; it was about creating a pause. I found the one master circuit that made it all stop, not out of malice, but from a desperate need for a single, shared moment of quiet where people might finally look up and see each other instead of the next directive. For just sixty seconds, the entire city held its breath, and in that silence, there was a question. They accuse me of disrupting the system. I’d argue I just reminded everyone it was there.
