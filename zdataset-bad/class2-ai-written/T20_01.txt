It’s a special kind of performance art you witness at these so-called silent retreats. There’s inevitably one person, draped in ethically questionable linen, who has achieved a level of spiritual enlightenment so profound it must be documented hourly on Instagram. They post a perfectly framed shot of their bare feet on a dewy yoga mat, captioned: ‘Finding my center. Finally unplugged.’ The irony seems to be on a wellness journey of its own, completely bypassing their consciousness as they meticulously apply the ‘Zen’ filter. You watch them, furiously typing with their thumbs under a banyan tree, and realize they haven't disconnected from anything at all; they've just found a new, more marketable way to scream for attention. It’s not about inner peace, it's about outer perception—a carefully curated commercial for a self they wish they were, broadcast live from a place of supposed tranquility.
