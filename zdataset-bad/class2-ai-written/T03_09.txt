Elias didn't bother with the door, vaulting the low fence of the post office instead. Mrs. Gable saw him coming, her mouth already forming an excuse, but he cut her off. "Who told you?" he demanded, his voice tight and low. She stammered, pointing a trembling finger toward the hardware store. He was off again, boots pounding the dusty main street. He burst through the door, the bell jangling wildly. Old Man Fitzroy dropped a box of nails, startled. "The delivery driver," Fitzroy coughed out before Elias could even ask. So that was it. He sprinted toward the loading docks behind the grocer's, his heart hammering against his ribs, his lungs burning. He saw the truck, its engine rumbling, ready to leave. He had to stop it. He had to stop the lie before it left town and became truth, even if it meant everyone saw him as the madman they were starting to whisper about.
