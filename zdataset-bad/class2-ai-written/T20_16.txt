Don’t you dare lecture me about responsibility. Seriously? You, who has that black-and-white photo of your own protest arrest framed on the mahogany desk you bought with your corporate bonus. You built an entire personality on being the one who fought the system, the rebel with a cause. You tell those stories at every holiday, polishing them like trophies. But when I do it—when I actually sacrifice something for a belief instead of just dining out on a fifty-year-old story—you threaten to cut me off? What a joke. Your rebellion is a museum piece, Dad. A safe, comfortable memory you can point to. Mine is happening now, and it’s inconvenient for you, so it’s suddenly immature. The sheer, laughable hypocrisy of it is almost too perfect. You wanted a rebel daughter in theory, not in practice.
