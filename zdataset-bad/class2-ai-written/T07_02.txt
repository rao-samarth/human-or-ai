The silence in the town square was a heavy, watchful thing. Every morning since the edict, Elara had walked this same path, her steps steady on the cobblestones while faces peered from behind curtains. Mayor Thornton stood on the steps of the town hall today, a statue of pure indignation, his arms crossed tight against his chest. He had forbidden all unauthorized displays, had demanded complete compliance, his voice booming through the square just a week ago. He expected fear. He expected obedience. What he got was this quiet woman and a single, defiant wildflower. She knelt, her back straight, and placed the vibrant crimson bloom at the foot of the cold bronze statue. It was a tiny thing against the stone, a fragile splash of color. But as she stood and met the Mayor’s glare without flinching, a tremor of something new—something like courage—ran through the hidden watchers. The flower wasn't just a flower anymore; it was a promise.
