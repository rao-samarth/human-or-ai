I was only trying to swat a fly, a very persistent one that had apparently mistaken my ear for a landing strip. Unfortunately, my frantic hand gesture coincided perfectly with the auctioneer’s final call for a ten-thousand-dollar bid. His gavel slammed down with a crack that felt like a personal judgment. “Sold!” he boomed, “To the gentleman in the back, so vigorously enthusiastic!” A spotlight swung around and found me, and my wife’s grip on my arm tightened with the force of a hydraulic press. I had a choice: publicly confess that my mortal enemy was a common insect, humiliating us both, or become the new owner of a life-sized, taxidermied giraffe wearing a monocle. The giraffe, I noted with a rising sense of dread, seemed to be staring right at me, its single glass eye glinting with what I could only interpret as smug victory. I chose the giraffe.
