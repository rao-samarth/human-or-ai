Thirty thousand feet up, the world flattens into a diagram. The veins of highways and the faint, glowing clusters of towns seem so inevitable from this altitude, as if the entire landscape was sketched out with a single, deliberate purpose. Yet I know that down there, in the midst of it, life feels like a series of small, urgent decisions: a missed exit, a spontaneous coffee with a stranger, choosing the right door or the wrong one. Are we just particles flowing through these pre-carved channels, convincing ourselves we’re the ones steering? This flight, for instance, was my choice—I bought the ticket, packed the bag, and walked onto this plane. And yet now, buckled into my seat, I am utterly powerless, carried along a single, invisible line toward a place I can only hope is the right one.
