My heart was a jackhammer against my ribs. The quarterly review slide, the one with the soaring revenue projections I’d triple-checked, was gone. In its place, flickering on the massive conference room screen, was a low-resolution video of a cat falling off a bookshelf in slow motion. Kevin, the new intern who had heroically stepped in to “fix the connection,” was frantically mashing buttons on my laptop, his face a mask of pure terror. I could feel the CFO’s gaze boring into the side of my head. My meticulously crafted speech about synergy and market penetration died on my lips, replaced by the faint, tinny sound of synthesized elevator music from the cat video. I stood there, frozen in the spotlight of my own professional demise, and then I heard it. A single, choked-off snort from the head of the table. Ms. Albright, our famously stoic CEO, was hiding a laugh behind her hand. The whole room held its breath, and in that agonizing silence, the cat hit the floor with a soft, digital poof.
