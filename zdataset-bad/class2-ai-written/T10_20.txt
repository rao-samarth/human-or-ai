As I stand here, holding this beautiful piece of glass, I'm reminded of the story you all know—the one about our breakthrough, a clean and linear path to success. What you were never shown were the other paths, the cul-de-sacs of failed experiments and contradictory results that were quietly filed away. Facts, you see, are not soldiers that march in a straight line; they are more like a crowd from which you can choose your champions while ushering the dissenters out a back door. I presented the narrative that secured your approval and your applause, a version of events so compelling you never thought to question its foundations. Every key detail I shared with you was accurate, but the architecture they built in your minds was entirely my design, not reality's.
