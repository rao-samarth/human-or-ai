Uncle Ted was in his element, regaling the dinner table with the saga of his 'unfortunate disagreement' with the club president. "It was all a simple clerical error," he boomed, waving his fork for emphasis as if it were a scepter. A clerical error that, by some strange coincidence, involved his car, the president’s prized rose bushes, and what I heard was a very expensive bottle of scotch. My cousins nodded along with practiced solemnity, their faces a perfect mask of concerned belief. Aunt Carol even chimed in with a supportive, "Well, these things happen," her universal solvent for everything from a spilled drink to a potential lawsuit. It was a masterful performance, a complete fabrication designed to patch the gaping hole in his public standing. We all knew the real story, of course; the frantic phone calls and hastily written apology letters had been the talk of the week. But here, under the warm glow of the dining room chandelier, we all played our part in the grand illusion, because admitting his crown was made of cheap tin foil would force us to examine the flimsy materials of our own.
