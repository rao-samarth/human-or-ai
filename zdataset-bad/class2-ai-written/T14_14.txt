The scent of grilled burgers hung in the humid afternoon air as my niece Maya traced her five-year plan on a condensation-slicked napkin. “…and after the promotion, I’ll finally be able to move to the coast,” she declared, certain. My sister, Carol, just smiled, flipping a patty. ‘It’s good to have a direction,’ she said, her voice softened by the sizzle of the grill. ‘But I thought I was going to be a botanist in California. Then one rainy Tuesday, I missed my bus, ducked into a bookstore to stay dry, and met your uncle while he was shelving philosophy books. You make your little plans, and then life happens right in the middle of them.’ Maya frowned, looking down at her blurry napkin-map as if trying to find the variable for a missed bus or an unexpected downpour.
