You asked if I was enjoying the peace and quiet out here, and the honest answer is that I’m not sure I’ve found it yet. Yesterday, I attempted a simple act of goodwill: rescuing a single, rather plump squirrel that had gotten itself stuck inside the empty rain barrel. What started as a gentle tipping maneuver somehow escalated into the barrel rolling down the entire length of the garden, gaining speed before it crashed directly into the neighbour's new, very elaborate bird bath. The resulting fountain of displaced water not only freed the squirrel but also drenched Mrs. Gable's prize-winning petunias and knocked a ceramic gnome clean off its pedestal. I stood there, frozen, as the gnome’s little red hat sailed through the air in a perfect arc and landed in my wheelbarrow. She just stared at me over the hedge, didn't say a word, and then slowly, deliberately, wrote something down in a small notebook. I think I’m on a list now.
