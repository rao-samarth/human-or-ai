My cousin David, now a successful lawyer, is explaining some complex case to my uncle, gesturing with a barbecue fork for emphasis. I remember when he was a teenager, completely lost, convinced he'd end up working at the local factory like his dad. What was the exact moment that shifted his trajectory? Was it a single, deliberate decision to study harder, or something smaller, like a teacher's chance comment or happening upon a book that sparked an unexpected interest? We all like to look back and construct a neat narrative of intention, to say he *chose* this life. But watching him now, so confident in his role, it feels more complicated. It’s like seeing the final, settled course of a river and trying to guess which specific raindrops and tiny rivulets were the ones that truly mattered in carving its path. The small, random events feel just as powerful as the grand, declared ambitions.
