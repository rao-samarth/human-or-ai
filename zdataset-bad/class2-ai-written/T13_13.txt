You can stop rearranging the cushions now; they aren’t the problem. For weeks, all I heard about was this perfect evening you were curating, how every single detail would be flawless because you, and only you, were in control. I offered to help, remember? You waved it off like it was an insult, so certain of the applause that was coming your way. And now you just sit here in the quiet wreckage of it all, refusing to meet my eyes, pretending to be fascinated by a wine stain on the rug. You built such a high pedestal for yourself, brick by painstaking brick, and I don't think you ever once considered what the ground would feel like when you finally fell off. I guess this silence is the only answer I’m going to get.
