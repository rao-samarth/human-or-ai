The rhythmic thump of a lone sneaker against the dryer drum is the only thing cutting through the low hum. I keep replaying the conversation in my head, editing my lines like a failed scriptwriter. What if I’d just said *that* instead? Or nothing at all? A woman two machines down is folding tiny socks, and for a second, I’m convinced she’s looking at me with this knowing pity. It's ridiculous, I know. She's just folding laundry. She can't see the knot in my stomach or hear the argument that plays on a permanent loop behind my eyes. Everyone else is just living their normal Tuesday, but I feel like I'm carrying this thing around, this heavy, invisible object that makes it hard to breathe right. It’s funny, you come here to get things clean, but some messes just seem to set in permanently, no matter how many cycles you put them through.
