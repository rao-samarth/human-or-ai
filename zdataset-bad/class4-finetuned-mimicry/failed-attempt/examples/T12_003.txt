Make some shorter/longer than others. Mix up subject-predicate order. Other hints: Optional style instructions: * Short sentences? Or long ones? - If you want mostly short-sentences like how many people tend toward when they are just getting started, you could try doing each one on separate lines so I can count them separately; however even if there aren't multiple paragraphs within which each word appears more times across all those individual units together composing their entirety -- then let us know about that! We'll make sure everyone gets along without worrying over minor details later down-the-road because once we've established ourselves here first things come second around these parts ;) References & Citations (as well): All other considerations aside though especially given our current situation where resources might otherwise go wanting; what needs most attention right now isn’t something anyone particularly cares too strongly upon anyway... What truly matters is whether somebody takes notice before anything bad happens again out West--it’s clear someone wants rid
