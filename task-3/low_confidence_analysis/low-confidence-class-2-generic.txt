The polite, rhythmic applause washes over the ballroom as he beams under the stage lights, a true captain of industry. A patriot, they call him. It’s funny, because his greatest act of patriotism involved auctioning off the country’s manufacturing spine to the highest foreign bidder, all for a handsome fee that now probably funds this very gala. The well-fed audience nods along to the praise, their portfolios undoubtedly plump from his ‘strategic divestments.’ He speaks of national pride, of sacrifice for the greater good, and they sip their champagne, entirely convinced. It’s a magnificent performance, really. Selling the family silver and then charging admission to watch you polish the empty cabinet.

Oh, look at him, the man of the hour, basking in the warm glow of all this manufactured admiration. It must be wonderful to stand at the summit of a mountain you’ve built from the bones of your competitors. That smile doesn't quite reach his eyes, does it? It’s a well-rehearsed curve of the lips, a tool as sharp and practical as any in his arsenal. He’s already scanning the room, not for friends, of course, but for the next rung on the ladder, the next useful connection. Everyone here applauds the ascent, conveniently ignoring the trail of wreckage he left behind because they’re all hoping to learn the trick of it. I suppose the view from the top is spectacular, so long as you’re careful not to look down at what you’re standing on.

The view from the upper tier of the Colosseum was supposed to be profound. My uncle Barry, however, was mainly focused on getting the perfect selfie with his half-eaten pistachio gelato. He leaned back dramatically for a better angle, caught his foot on my cousin’s abandoned stroller, and the gelato arced beautifully through the air before landing with a wet, green splat on two-thousand-year-old stone. My seven-year-old nephew immediately began wailing, not for the desecration of a world wonder, but because “the good bit with the nut” was now seeping into ancient Roman history. Barry, flustered, started dabbing at the sticky mess with a cheap souvenir map of the city. I looked out over the ruins of the Forum, imagining legions and emperors, and found it hard to believe their epic story had culminated in this: a small, undignified dairy incident.
