The town council, when it met, liked to concern itself with matters of high principle and civic beautification, which is a fine and noble thing for a body of men to do. There was a two-hour argument, I recollect, about the proper Grecian style for a drinking fountain that had not yet been funded, paid for, or even located on a map. Mr. Abernathy gave a stirring speech on the lasting importance of public aesthetics, a speech that was roundly applauded by men who afterwards would step outside into a street that was little more than a river of mud and refuse when it rained, and a plain of dust and argument when it did not. They would debate the moral character of the republic for a whole evening, and then go home to houses where the well water was known to give a man the summer complaint. It does seem that the further a problem is from a man’s own boots, the more he enjoys the ceremony of solving it.

As this sunny afternoon in the English countryside began to unfold, I found myself reclining in a deck chair with the sort of profound lethargy usually reserved for hibernating mammals or certain members of the Drones Club after a particularly vigorous Boat Race night. The air was thick with the scent of wallflowers and the distant, rhythmic clonk of croquet mallets, a sound that usually signals the impending doom of one’s shins. Jeeves, appearing from the ether with that uncanny silent tread that suggests he might be part spectral, shimmered toward me with a cooling beverage that looked remarkably like salvation in a tall glass. I was just contemplating whether the effort of lifting the straw would overtax my constitution when the peace was shattered by the approach of Aunt Agatha. She was moving across the lawn with the grim, purposeful stride of a high-court judge about to deliver a sentence of hard labor, and one look at her face told me that my hopes for a quiet weekend were about to be put through the wringer.

A man gets to thinking on a long train journey, with the world blurring past the window in a monotonous smudge. People have a notion that this trade is a bolt of lightning from heaven—that a fellow is struck by a grand idea and the words simply arrange themselves on the page as if by magic. What a magnificent piece of humbug. The plain truth of the matter is you hunt down an idea like a dog after a rabbit, and if you’re lucky enough to catch it, you then have the devil’s own time skinning it and making it presentable for the market. You sweat and curse and bleed ink onto the paper, only to have some publisher in a starched collar inform you that your particular brand of truth is not selling well this season. It's a grand swindle, this business of stringing sentences together for pay; you sell pieces of your own mind for coin, and are then told the pieces are the wrong shape.
