Fleming, the county’s undisputed sprinting champion, perambulated before the starting line with an air of insufferable certainty. He nodded curtly to the assembled townsfolk, his visage a mask of supreme confidence, as if their adulation were merely his due. The pistol cracked! He shot forth like an arrow from a bow, his form impeccable, his lead established within a dozen paces as the dirt flew from beneath his heels. The crowd roared its approval, for his athletic prowess was a point of intense local pride. He risked a glance over his shoulder—a fatal error born of pure vanity—and in that singular instant, his foot caught upon a stray root protruding from the turf. The calamity was both instantaneous and total. He tumbled forward in a most undignified heap of flailing limbs, his momentum carrying him into an ignominious slide through the mud beside the track. The great roar of the crowd died into a shocked silence, soon punctured by the unmistakable sound of derisive laughter as a gangly youth from the next village trotted past to claim the prize.
