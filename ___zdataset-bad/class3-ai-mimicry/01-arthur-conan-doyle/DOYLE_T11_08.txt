I confess I had paid little heed to the two men waiting upon the platform until my companion directed my attention with a slight nod. One was manifestly a man of means—a prosperous merchant, perhaps—whose gleaming luggage and air of command bespoke a life of ease; the other, a stooping clerk with a worn satchel, whose entire bearing spoke of long hours and little reward. When the porter arrived, he sprang forward to assist the first gentleman with an almost theatrical deference, yet offered the second merely a cursory glance before turning away. It was a most singular demonstration, I thought, of that invisible ledger which is kept upon every soul in this city. A man’s station, his prospects, his very worth to others, all assessed in a single, sweeping look, based upon nothing more than the cut of his coat and the confidence in his eye. There it was: an entire system of rank and obligation played out in that trifling station-house drama.
