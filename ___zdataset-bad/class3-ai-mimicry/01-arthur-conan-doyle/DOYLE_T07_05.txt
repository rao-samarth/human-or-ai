You speak to me of consequence, of the ruin I shall bring upon my own career, but I ask you, what is a career when measured against a man’s soul? For weeks, I have abided by your command, holding my tongue whilst your syndicate bleeds our townships dry, all under the colour of law and the guise of progress. I have watched you from across this very desk, sir, and seen the cold arithmetic in your eyes as you calculate profits against the poverty of honest men. It is a brand of tyranny more insidious than any gaoler’s chain, for it wears the mask of respectability. Well, I for one will wear that mask no longer. My defiance is not a sudden madness, as you would have it, but rather the final, desperate remedy of a conscience pushed past its endurance. Condemn me if you must, but know that I would rather stand alone in truth than beside you in this profitable damnation.
