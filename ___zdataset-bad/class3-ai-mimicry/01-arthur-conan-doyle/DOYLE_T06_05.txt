It is a curious malady of the soul, one I have frequently observed amidst the great press of humanity that throngs our city’s pavements. A fellow’s gaze might follow a carriage of superior make, his own humble station momentarily sharpened by a sudden, bitter pang of discontent; or a lady might observe another’s fine apparel with an admiration so keen it sours upon the instant. Yet I have come to believe this affliction is not wholly the curse that the moralists would have us believe. For is it not this very same sting that prods the sluggard from his slumber and sets the inventor to his task? It is a fire, to be sure, and one that may consume a man if left untended to smoulder in the dark recesses of the heart. But when mastered and turned outwards, what a prodigious engine it becomes for the betterment of one’s own lot! Thus, in these fleeting shadows on the faces in the crowd, I see not the seeds of malice, but the nascent stirrings of a great and powerful hope.
