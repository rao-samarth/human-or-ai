Within the hushed dining room of the Diogenes Club, where silence is the foremost rule, the low murmur of two guests in a far corner became, by its very nature, a public pronouncement. The elder gentleman spoke of a mutual acquaintance, one who had recently come into a considerable inheritance. His praise, however, was of a peculiar and curdled variety; for every compliment upon the man’s good fortune, there followed a subtle questioning of his capacity to manage it, a veiled suggestion that such a windfall was ill-suited to his character. It is a singular poison of the soul, one which drives a man not to outright slander, but to the far more insidious work of chipping away at another’s pedestal. The listener, a portly fellow engrossed in his port, seemed to notice nothing amiss, yet to a discerning eye, the speaker’s every gesture—the tight set of his jaw, the restless drumming of his fingers—betrayed a profound and bitter discontent, a sickness born from watching another man grasp the very prize he felt was his own by right.
