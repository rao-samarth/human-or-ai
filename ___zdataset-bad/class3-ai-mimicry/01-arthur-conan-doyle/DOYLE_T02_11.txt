It is a peculiar study, this performance of familial grief. My nephew, young Edward, plays his part with a commendable, if somewhat theatrical, solemnity. He clutches the arm of his new fiancée—a girl of no particular consequence until a month ago—and affects a stoop that I have never before witnessed in his athletic shoulders. The conclusion is elementary, is it not? The profound sorrow is but a cloak for a more profound satisfaction; the inheritance, you see, has quite eclipsed the loss of the benefactor. His eyes, when he believes himself unobserved, dart towards the solicitor with a gleam that is less about filial piety and more about fiscal impatience. A poor show, all in all, for one cannot truly master the art of the mask if the true face is so transparent to any man of reasonable perception.
