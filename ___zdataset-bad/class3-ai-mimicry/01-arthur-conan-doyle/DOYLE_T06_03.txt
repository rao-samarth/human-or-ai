I watched him from across the thoroughfare, a man whose spirit seemed to shrink amidst the ceaseless procession of the city. He stood quite still, his gaze fixed not upon any particular object, but rather upon the general spectacle of prosperity that flowed past him—the gleaming carriages, the fine silks, the casual laughter of those whose lives were evidently untroubled by want. It is a singular malady of the mind, I reflected, to view the good fortune of another not as a neutral fact, but as a personal subtraction, as if every smile on a stranger’s face were a coin pilfered from one’s own empty purse. He saw in their contentment a quiet mockery of his own struggles, and in their ease, a deliberate weight added to his own burdens. For such a man, the world is not a place of shared experience, but a cruel ledger where another’s gain is, and must always be, his own profound and bitter loss.
