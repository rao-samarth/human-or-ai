It was with a peculiar and most disagreeable sensation that I observed Mr. Abernathy clap young Fleming upon the shoulder, pronouncing his recent brief upon the Atherton case a work of singular clarity. Singular clarity, indeed; for had I not myself laboured for three consecutive nights upon the very precedents which formed its unshakeable backbone, only to have him apply a final, superficial polish? The fellow’s countenance, a mask of modest gratitude, betrayed nothing of the truth, and a hot protest rose to my lips—a demand for simple justice. Yet it died there, unuttered. To voice my claim now, in the face of such public commendation, would be to appear a creature of the basest sort, consumed by an unseemly and grasping resentment. I perceived, with the force of a physical blow, that my own quiet diligence was to be the very instrument of my eclipse; I must either swallow the gall of this deception or be branded the source of all office discord.
