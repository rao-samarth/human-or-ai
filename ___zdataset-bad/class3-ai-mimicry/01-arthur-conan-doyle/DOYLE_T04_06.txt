You question my decision to parley with that man, and I perceive in your tone an accusation—a belief that I have somehow faltered in my allegiances. Yet you must comprehend that the sturdiest of compacts is not one which is kept locked away from all trial, but rather one that is subjected to the crucible and emerges unaltered. An association built in the quiet days of prosperity is a pleasant thing, indeed; yet its true substance, its very mettle, can only be ascertained when the winds of adversity and opportunity begin to blow. That I could hear his proposition, weigh the considerable advantages it offered, and still hold to our original course—that, my dear fellow, is not the mark of a wavering confederate. It is, on the contrary, the most definitive proof of a resolution that has been examined and found sound. For what is a man’s word worth if it has never been tempted to be broken?
