You speak of ‘pluck,’ and I find the term entirely misplaced—a bauble for the sentimentalist. When that brute produced his revolver, what you perceived as a moment of high drama was, for me, a simple problem of arithmetic. The man’s hand trembled, you see; a clear sign of an irresolute will. To hesitate or to flee would have invited a shot born of pure panic, whereas a sudden advance presented a superior chance of survival. The only logical recourse, therefore, was to close the distance before his clumsy finger could find its purpose. Pray, do not mistake a rapid calculation for some noble conquest of the soul. Fear is a most unprofitable sentiment when one's continued existence is the matter at hand; it is an indulgence, sir, and one I could ill afford at that precise juncture.
