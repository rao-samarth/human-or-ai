You perceive, I trust, that I had no alternative in the matter, despite what you may have heard whispered in the club. The fellow, Thompson, had let slip a certain remark in the hearing of men whose opinions carry weight—a baseless and venomous insinuation regarding the origins of my family’s fortune. Such a stain, you understand, cannot be merely washed away; it must be excised, root and stem, before it can fester. It was not a matter of vengeance, pray believe me, but of simple sanitation. Hence his present unfortunate circumstances. Some might call the methodical dismantling of his credit and the quiet circulation of his past indiscretions a cruel overreaction to a careless word, but what is a man without his standing? He is nothing but a ghost in his own life. Thompson’s complete professional ruin serves as a necessary, if regrettable, public notice that my good name is not a thing to be trifled with by idle tongues.
