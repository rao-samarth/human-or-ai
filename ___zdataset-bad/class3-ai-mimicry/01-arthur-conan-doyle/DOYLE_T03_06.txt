He perceives a simple transaction, a momentary indiscretion, whilst I see the yawning abyss. A single word of this calumny whispered abroad would undo everything, leaving only disgrace. The price he names is exorbitant, a veritable king’s ransom for a trifle, yet what is any sum of money when measured against utter and complete ruin? He shall have what he asks; he must. The alternative is quite unthinkable.
