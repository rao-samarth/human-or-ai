You ask after Abernathy, and I must confess I deliver the news with a heavy heart. This great and teeming metropolis, for all its wonders, acts as a most severe crucible for a man’s character; it will either temper the steel of his resolve or melt it down to mere slag, and I fear our old companion has succumbed to the latter process. His once unwavering countenance is now marked by a certain furtive cunning, and his speech, heretofore direct, has become a thing of evasions and half-truths. It was, I deduce, the allure of that rather dubious South American speculation—a promise of swift and unearned fortune—that proved too great an inducement for his principles to withstand. Alas, it is a most singular and painful thing to observe a man trade the invaluable currency of good faith for the simple glitter of coin, and I find I can no longer depend upon him in any serious affair.
