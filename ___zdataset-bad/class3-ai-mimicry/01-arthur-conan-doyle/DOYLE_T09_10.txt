It is a singular torment of the mind when it becomes its own chief prosecutor, tirelessly re-examining a case long since closed to the outside world. The facts of my transaction with Mr Abernathy are, upon the business ledger, quite settled; a clever manoeuvre, a timely investment, and a most satisfactory outcome for the firm. Yet the human ledger tells a different tale—one of a confidence betrayed and a friendship leveraged for simple profit. One may justify such an action to one’s fellows with a shrug and a mention of commercial necessity, but to argue the case before the silent tribunal of oneself is an altogether more hopeless matter. This internal inquisitor, this tireless barrister of the soul, requires no fresh evidence, for it was present at the crime. It cross-examines not to discover the truth, which it knows full well, but merely to replay the moment of failing, ensuring that the sentence—this cold and unending disquiet—is served in full.
