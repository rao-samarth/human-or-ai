The tranquility of the parish churchyard was presently disturbed by a minor drama involving the new curate and our notoriously proud churchwarden, Mr. Alistair Finch. An attempt to secure a wobbling cherub upon a headstone devolved, through a series of misfortunes as lamentable as they were predictable, into a scene of pure pandemonium. First the mallet, then the churchwarden's spectacles, and finally Mr. Finch himself—in a desperate lunge to save his dignity—all tumbled into the freshly-dug grave of old Mrs. Higgins. From my secluded vantage point behind the yew hedge, I had observed the entire proceeding, including the precipitous flight of Finch’s gold pocket-watch, which now lay gleaming at the bottom of the pit. To announce its location would be to restore the man’s property, yet it would also confirm his utter buffoonery before the gawping parishioners. I confess, the problem of whether to sacrifice a man’s pride for his possessions, or to let him simmer in a righteous, albeit muddy, indignation, presented a far more complex logical puzzle than the one which had landed him there.
