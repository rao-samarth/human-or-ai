It is a most singular property of the human mind that it abhors a vacuum; furnish it with but a handful of disconnected details, and it will immediately strain to construct a coherent narrative, much like a spider spinning its web in a darkened corner. The true artist in persuasion understands this principle implicitly. He does not resort to clumsy, outright falsehoods, for such things are brittle and apt to shatter under the slightest scrutiny. Instead, he presents a series of unimpeachable truths, each one a polished and solid thing, yet he selects them with the most exquisite care. The recipient, believing himself to be exercising his own keen judgment upon the available evidence, dutifully assembles the pieces provided, never once suspecting that the most crucial elements—the very keystones of the affair—have been judiciously withheld, leaving him to fashion a prison of conviction from a carefully curated set of facts.
