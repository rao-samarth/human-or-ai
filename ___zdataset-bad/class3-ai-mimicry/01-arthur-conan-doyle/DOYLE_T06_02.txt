You must forgive me, Finch, if I fail to perceive the grave threat posed by Professor Albright’s latest publication. I grant you the man’s prose is rather more florid than is strictly necessary for a treatise on mollusc evolution, and his portrait on the dust jacket does possess a smirk of quite insufferable self-satisfaction. Yet, to see you stalk about this room, to hear you speak of professional sabotage and stolen glory, all because his book has garnered a marginally more favourable review in The Quarterly, strikes me as a most curious manifestation of distress. Surely you do not suppose he charmed the critic with his turns of phrase concerning the gastropod’s foot? The notion that a man’s reputation could be undone by a rival’s superior simile is a proposition so exquisitely absurd that it borders, my dear fellow, upon the comical.
