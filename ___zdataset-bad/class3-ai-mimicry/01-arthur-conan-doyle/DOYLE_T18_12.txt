Our journey southwards, which had hitherto been a model of tranquil punctuality, was plunged into a most extraordinary state of anarchy by a single, unforeseen agent. The offending creature, a diminutive primate belonging to a gesticulating Neapolitan merchant, had slipped its bonds. What followed was a spectacle of such profound ineptitude that it bordered upon high art. The little beast, chattering with a glee I found wholly inappropriate, first assailed the precarious tower of botanical specimens belonging to a stout gentleman from Bonn, sending dried ferns and delicate pressings fluttering about the carriage like some monstrous confetti. Its owner’s frantic lunges succeeded only in upsetting a lady’s hatbox, whilst the German’s cries of “Halt! Ungeheuer!” served merely to spur the animal to greater heights of acrobatic mischief. I sank back into my seat, overcome by the sheer, unreasoning bedlam of it all—a miniature tempest in our speeding world, whipped up by a creature of no consequence and fanned by the very worst of human efforts.
