Amid the low hum of conversation in Lord Ashworth's drawing-room, my attention was drawn to Sir Reginald, a man whose principles I had hitherto held in some esteem. He was engaged in quiet colloquy with that notorious financier, Mr. Thorne, and it was not the words I overheard—for they were but a murmur—but rather the singular transformation upon Sir Reginald’s countenance which gave me pause. As Thorne spoke, a certain hard glitter entered his eye, a look I had seen before, though only in the desperate and the lost. Every genteel instinct, every scruple which had once guided his path, seemed to melt away before the whispered promise of some vast and dubious advantage. He nodded, a sharp, bird-like motion, and in that simple gesture, I perceived a soul bargaining itself away for a future of gilded misery; a good name, so painstakingly built, was now but a commodity to be bartered in a hushed corner, far from the honest light of day.
