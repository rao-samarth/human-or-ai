The new lord of the manor, a gentleman whose fortune greatly outstripped his understanding of country folk, had recently seen fit to close the ancient right-of-way across his north meadow. He had erected a formidable-looking gate, complete with a sternly worded notice threatening all manner of legal unpleasantness for any who should trespass. And yet, upon my afternoon constitutional, I observed a most instructive little drama. The gate remained stoutly locked, the notice unblemished; no villager had been so bold as to challenge the new order directly. Instead, a fresh path, a mere whisper in the grass, had been worn around the stoutest of the gate’s anchor posts. It was a trifling detour, to be sure, but it spoke volumes. Here was no grand uprising, but a quiet, obstinate refusal to be governed in a matter where generations of custom had already ruled—a silent compact of an entire village against the will of one man.
