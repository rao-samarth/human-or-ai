There is no spectacle quite so tiresome as a man publicly wrestling with his own soul. I saw such a specimen today, stalled mid-pavement amidst the great torrent of commerce, his face a veritable theatre of remorse. No doubt some petty treachery occupied his thoughts—a promise broken, a confidence betrayed, the usual sordid business of mankind. He stared at the grimy cobblestones as if they might offer him some manner of absolution, a common and particularly foolish fancy. The great throng of clerks and costermongers swept past him, utterly indifferent to his little drama; for every man in this great metropolis carries his own private ledger of regrets, and has precious little time for the accounts of others. He might as well have confessed his sins to a lamppost for all the good it did him; indeed, the lamppost would have offered a more steadfast, if equally useless, audience.
