A man can’t rightly settle himself once he’s gone and done a thing he knows he oughtn’t. I took to the fields, thinking the wide-open quiet would wash the business clean out of my head, but it was a fool’s notion. The trouble with a guilty soul is that it’s got longer legs than you have, and it gets to where you’re going first and is there waiting for you. Every rustle in the corn stalks was a whisper of my foolishness, and every bird that chirped seemed to be tattling the whole story to the heavens. I commenced to walking faster, then near to a run, as if I could out-distance the miserable feeling churning in my gut. But there ain’t no geography that can cure a sickness of the spirit; you just end up a tired-out rascal in a new spot, with the same old devil sitting on your shoulder, grinning and comfortable as you please.
