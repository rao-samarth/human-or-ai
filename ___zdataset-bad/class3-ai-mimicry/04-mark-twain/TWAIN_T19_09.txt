That grand oil painting hanging above the mantelpiece, now, is a curious study when the house is still and the lamps are low. In the painter’s hands, my wife's forebears have been fashioned into a veritable congress of saints—the patriarch with his pious gaze fixed on some far-off heavenly reward, his wife a marble statue of maternal grace, and the children looking so angelic you'd swear they never once tracked mud across a clean floor. A man gazing upon it for the first time would likely feel a pang of his own unworthiness. But I, who have heard the true family histories—of business dealings that were more shrewd than saintly, and of a temper that could blister paint right off the walls—see a different picture entirely. The artist captured the family’s ambition for what they ought to be, and in that he was a master; but the flesh-and-blood reality was a far more interesting, and human, sort of chaos. It's a fine piece of work, but it ain't the gospel.
