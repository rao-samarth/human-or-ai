Young Mr. Davies stood before the new accounts ledger, a goliath of a book that had already caused two of his predecessors to develop sudden and mysterious ailments requiring immediate and lengthy convalescence. A man could look at such a sprawling mess of figures and reckon the universe had simply dealt him a calamitous hand, a thing to be endured rather than managed, like bothersome relatives or a summer ague. For a moment, I thought the boy might bolt himself. But then a curious thing happened—he procured not one, but three pots of different colored ink and a brand-new ruler, and with a jaw set firm enough to crack walnuts, he commenced to draw his own lines. He began to build his own sense right atop the existing chaos, not with a grand announcement, but with the quiet determination of a river cutting a new path. It’s a fine notion, and a comforting one, that while the world might hand a man a muddled page, a fellow with a little sand and a steady hand can rule it up whichever way he pleases.
