You look at that pile of promises like it's the sun itself, and I don't blame you, son, I truly don't. It's a grand temptation, a regular siren's song composed for a poor man's empty pockets, and it sings a mighty sweet tune. But I reckon a man's got a kind of internal machinery—a fine and delicate contraption of his own making—that's worth more than all the finagling and back-alley handshakes in creation. You can bust that machinery for a quick profit, sure enough, and spend the silver until it's gone; but then what? You're left with a rattling wreck inside you that can't tell right from wrong, and no amount of gold can pay the craftsman to fix that particular piece of work. Keep your own gears turning true, and you'll find you're a wealthier man than any king whose crown was bought with a lie.
