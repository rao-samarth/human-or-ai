I do wish you could have seen it, my friend, for it was a spectacle of human nature in its purest and most lamentable form. A slick-haired fellow from the city blew through our quiet parts last week, a man with a suit so fine it looked like it might sue you for wrinkling it and a silken palaver to match. He wasn't selling land or lightning rods, no—he was selling shares in a notion, some fool contraption for harnessing the very energy of a running stream without ever getting the machinery wet, a scientific miracle he called it. And to watch the eyes of otherwise sensible men—men who know the value of a day’s sweat and the cussedness of nature—glaze over with the prospect of unearned dollars was a thing to behold. Good sense was entirely abolished in favor of a golden dream, and a man who wouldn't ordinarily trust his own shadow with a nickel was suddenly ready to mortgage his pig and his wife’s good silver on the word of a smiling scoundrel.
