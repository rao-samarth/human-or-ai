You take a fine Sunday afternoon in a place like this, with the bees humming a lazy sermon in the clover, and you might mistake the whole affair for the very vestibule of Heaven. But a man with one good eye and half a lick of sense knows better; he knows that the truest version of a person is the one they keep locked up behind their teeth. Why, there’s Jedediah, shaking the parson’s hand so earnestly you’d think he was practicing for St. Peter, all the while calculating how to short-change that same parson on a cord of wood come Tuesday; and there’s Martha, admiring Clara’s new bonnet with a sweetness that would curdle milk, while privately judging it a sin against God and good taste. Every last soul is a walking advertisement for a creature that doesn’t exist. It’s a grand, silent play, and the only honest man in the county is the undertaker, for he, at least, is upfront about what he’s selling.
