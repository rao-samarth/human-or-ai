Well, you never saw such a ruckus as when the stout gentleman in the silk vest decided the line at the ticket office was a private insult aimed directly at him. He sailed past a half-dozen of us waiting souls as if we were nothing more than inconveniently placed fence posts, his chin held so high a man could get a crick in his neck just looking at it. A farmer, whose knuckles were better acquainted with a plow handle than a silver spoon, let out a kind of strangled protest, but the gentleman paid him no more mind than he would a buzzing fly. He simply tapped his cane on the floorboards—a sharp, commanding crack!—and the ticket agent, who’d been moving with the geological slowness of a glacier just a moment before, suddenly found a heretofore unknown spring in his step. The rest of us just stood there, you see, having learned the powerful lesson that the fastest way to the front is to carry yourself as if you were born there and everyone else was trespassing.
