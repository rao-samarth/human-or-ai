It is a curious and altogether dispiriting spectacle to watch a man like Abernathy receive a promotion. Here is a fellow whose most strenuous daily labor involves the polishing of his spectacles and the careful cultivation of a frown of deep—but ultimately fraudulent—concentration. And yet, the superintendent claps him on the back, lauds his ‘unflinching dedication,’ and hands him a fatter pay-envelope, while men of actual industry look on with the sort of fixed, polite smiles you might see on a corpse at a poorly attended funeral. This peculiar brand of silent resentment, this green-tinted spiritual malady that festers in the heart when a lesser man stumbles into a greater reward, is a more common currency in an office than dollars and cents. We congratulate him with all the sincerity of a fox complimenting a chicken on its new, state-of-the-art henhouse; all the while, we are privately calculating the structural weaknesses in its design and praying for a strong wind.
