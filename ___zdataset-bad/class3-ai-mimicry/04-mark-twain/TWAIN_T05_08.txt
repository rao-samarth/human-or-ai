Well, it was a mighty solemn affair, this engagement supper, a regular pageant of civilized misery where a man was expected to look pleased as punch to be there. I found myself trapped by the bride’s father, a man whose chief industry was the manufacture of his own importance, and my sworn duty was to nod while he explained the virtues of his particular brand of commerce. A promise to attend, you see, is a sacred and binding thing, especially to one's aunt. But across the sea of starched collars and wilting flowers was Miss Eleanor, laughing at some joke told by a young fool with more hair than sense. And there I stood, a prisoner of etiquette, tethered by a thread of politeness while my own good sense was screaming to make a run for it. It’s a curious sort of private damnation, being a gentleman; it sentences you to hard labor in the dullest corner of earth while heaven itself is holding court twenty feet away and serving better punch.
