The music sawed away, a cheerful sort of humbug meant to convince a body he was having a fine time, and the ladies’ gowns made a prodigious rustle like dry leaves in a whirlwind. I tried to fix a smile on my face—the kind a man wears when he’s admiring the chandeliers—but it was a flimsy affair, liable to crack at any moment. For across the room, I saw him, laughing with the mayor’s wife, and the sight of it was a hot poker to my insides. My own treachery sat in my stomach like a lump of indigestible lead, a miserable secret feasting on all the fine food and wine. It’s a curious and terrible thing, how a man’s spirit can be hollering for a reckoning in the midst of so much polite society, every fiddle-squeak and champagne-pop sounding like a hammer on the anvil of your own damnation. There ain't no hiding place from yourself.
