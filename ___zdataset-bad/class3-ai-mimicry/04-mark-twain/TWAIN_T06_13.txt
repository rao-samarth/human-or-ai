Silas slammed the door and commenced to pacing, his boots striking the floorboards with a fury that threatened to wake the dead—let alone the slumbering hound by the fire. He’d worked himself into a fine lather of righteous indignation over some perceived slight, some scrap of success I’d happened upon that he figured ought to have been his by divine right. He spun on his heel, his face the color of a botched plum pudding, and jabbed a finger in my direction, loosing a string of insults that had considerably more heat than light. It is a curious affliction of the soul, this malady; it convinces a perfectly sound man that his neighbor’s well-tended garden is the sole cause of his own patch of weeds, and that the only proper cure is to salt the other fellow's earth. He wasn't a man I knew anymore, just a walking, shouting monument to the particular misery of wanting what ain’t yours.
