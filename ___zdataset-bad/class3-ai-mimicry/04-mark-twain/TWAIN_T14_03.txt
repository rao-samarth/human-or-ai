My sister’s boy, young William, stood by the hearth and laid out his life for us as if it were a railroad map of his own drawing, every station and siding placed there by his own magnificent will. The old aunts nodded with damp eyes, and his father puffed out his chest, seeing a great man in the making—a creature of pure decision. But I looked at that boy, all full of fire and certainty, and a terrible pity took hold of me. He spoke of his choices, bless his heart, but what he called a choice was merely the spot where the river current, which had carried him blindly from the start, would happen to slam him against the bank. He fancies himself the captain, you see, but he is only a passenger on a raft he did not build, floating down a river he did not name, toward an ocean he does not believe exists. And when he gets there, he will praise his own navigation.
