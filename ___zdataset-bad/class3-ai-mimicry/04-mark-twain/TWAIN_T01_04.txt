I have been observing a certain Mr. Abernathy in the accounts department, a man who has made a science of climbing. He does not clamber up the ladder of commerce with any boisterous enthusiasm, you understand; rather, he ascends with the quiet, inexorable progress of a vine strangling an oak. His chief contrivance is a kind of selective memory, a most useful faculty which allows him to forget any gentleman’s contribution to a successful undertaking while remembering with crystalline clarity every minor error made by a competitor. He’ll nod and smile and agree with you to your face, all the while polishing the rungs above your head with the sleeve of his coat. And he has got his promotions, every one of them. The only price, it seems, is that he has whittled himself down to nothing but the ambition itself—a well-dressed, respectable-looking vacancy where a man used to be.
