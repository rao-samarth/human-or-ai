There is a peculiar sort of silence that falls over a public dining room when a man’s very soul is put up for auction, and every stranger in the vicinity gets a free ticket to the proceedings. Young Thomas sat there, looking at his uneaten stew, while the big man from the railroad—a fellow whose promises were as expansive as his waistcoat—laid out the terms of betrayal as if it were a simple bill of lading. All Thomas had to do was misremember the time he’d seen his friend, Henry, down by the creek; just a little fiddling with the clock in his head, and a good-paying foreman’s job would materialize for him out of thin air. I watched the poor fool’s eyes flicker from the railroad man’s shiny pink face to the door where Henry had just departed, and you could practically see the gears of his conscience grinding themselves to dust. The whole affair was a powerful sermon, demonstrating how a man’s loyalty is a mighty fortress until a fellow with a key made of silver comes strolling up to the gate.
