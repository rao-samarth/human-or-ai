Mr. Abernathy’s new filing system was presented to us as a triumph of industrial reason; a great iron-and-brass contraption guaranteed to tame the paper wilderness that choked our establishment. A man could feed a letter into its gullet, pull a series of color-coded levers, and—presto!—the document would be whisked away to its rightful home by a miracle of pneumatic force. Well, I have now watched for the better part of an hour as poor Thompson, a man whose intellect is as placid as a millpond on a windless day, has tried to file a simple invoice. He consults his voluminous manual, he squints at the levers, he offers a silent prayer to whatever deity governs office machinery. The machine, for its part, has responded by variously jamming, emitting a high-pitched squeal that sets the teeth on edge, and, in one spectacular flourish, shooting the invoice out of a wrong tube so that it landed squarely in the chief clerk’s inkwell. You can build a monument to order, it seems, but you cannot keep a fool from turning it into a fountain.
