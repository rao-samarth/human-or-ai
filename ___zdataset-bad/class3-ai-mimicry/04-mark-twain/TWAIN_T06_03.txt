Silas Croft took to inspecting the foundations of his neighbor’s house that summer, a sudden architectural concern that fooled no one, least of all his wife. The true object of his daily scrutiny was a gleaming white contraption on Henderson’s porch—a patent ice-chest, humming with an infernal sort of quiet. Silas would amble past, tipping his hat, all the while calculating the sheer impropriety of it all; a man had no business possessing a private winter in the middle of a blistering July. He began to question the source of Henderson’s sudden fortune, for such a luxury could not have been purchased with the proceeds from an honest man’s chickens. A deep, abiding suspicion took root in his soul, a certainty that this box of manufactured cold was but the first symptom of a creeping moral rot. His own well, which had hitherto produced the finest drinking water in three counties, now felt like a common mud-puddle, a relic of a simpler and more virtuous age.
