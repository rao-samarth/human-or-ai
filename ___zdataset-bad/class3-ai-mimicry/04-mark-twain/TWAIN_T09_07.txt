That dollar, which I had procured from the pavement with the slyness of a starving cat, commenced to burn a hole not just in my trousers but clean through my general composure. I told myself it was simple justice—a redistribution of fortune from a man whose waistcoat was plainly bursting with unearned dividends to a fellow whose stomach was acquainted only with the memory of a biscuit. But that little internal preacher, the one a man can’t fire, he set to work right away with his sermonizing. It seemed the whole city was in on his scheme; every clanging streetcar bell shouted “Thief!” and the newsboys, hawking papers about some far-off political botheration, appeared to be aiming their headlines directly at my guilty soul. A dozen times I was on the verge of flinging the silver devil into a gutter, but the notion of my own foolishness was nearly as painful as the crime itself. A man can’t win—he’s tormented if he sins, and he’s a fool if he repents for a profit of one dollar.
