There’s a grand and noisy spectacle to be found on any city corner, where a hundred souls hurry past, each one the absolute monarch of his own private kingdom of right and wrong. A man in a starched collar and a tall hat will call for a balanced scale and a whole lot of palaver to settle a grievance, and the newspapers will pronounce it a triumph of civilization. But you let a fellow whose pocket has been picked catch the rascal himself, and the settlement that follows is a good deal quicker and, I suspect, more satisfying to the parties directly involved. The whole business seems to be a matter of who’s watching, and whether the affair is dressed up in a wig and a black robe or just a plain-spun coat of fury. One is a dish served cold with a sermon; the other is served hot and right from the heart. I am not certain the Almighty makes much of a distinction between the two recipes.
