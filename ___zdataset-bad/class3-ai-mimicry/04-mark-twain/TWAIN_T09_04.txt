A fellow can get used to most any kind of trouble—a leaky roof, a quarrelsome neighbor, even the tax man—but there ain't no getting accustomed to the racket your own insides can make once you’ve gone and done a shabby thing. It ain't a loud noise, you understand, not like thunder or a dog-fight, but a persistent, nagging sort of buzz, like a mosquito you can’t ever seem to swat. Sleep won't have a thing to do with you, and the dark just gives the whole miserable business more room to parade around in your head. You try to reason with it, tell it the thing is done and can’t be undone, but that particular scoundrel don’t listen to reason no more than a stump listens to a sermon. It just sits there, heavy and sour, reminding you that you ain't the fine, upstanding citizen you was pretending to be just yesterday morning.
