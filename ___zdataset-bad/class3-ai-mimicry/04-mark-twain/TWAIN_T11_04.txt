Don't you see the humbug in it? You speak of a man's station as if it were a peak he climbed by the pure force of his own virtue, when it is mostly a perch he was born upon. The whole affair is a grand and solemn bit of play-acting, a stage where the actors in the fine costumes have convinced themselves—and most of the audience, I'll grant you—that their silks and titles are woven from a superior sort of soul. They invent a thousand little rules, a thousand delicate fences of etiquette and breeding, designed for no other purpose than to keep the common man from hopping over and discovering the throne is just a gilded chair. It is the most profitable swindle ever perpetrated by one set of men upon another, for the victims themselves are taught to admire their chains and praise the quality of the lock.
