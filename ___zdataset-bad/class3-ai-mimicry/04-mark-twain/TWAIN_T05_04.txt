Out here in this great human river, where a fellow can’t hardly turn around without bumping into a newfangled notion or an old-fashioned debt, I had it all figured. A straight and narrow path had been laid out by men a good deal wiser and deader than myself—a respectable future built on sensible promises, as solid and as gray as the paving stones under my feet. And then there was Clara, with a laugh that could cut through the din of ten-thousand carriages and make a man’s heart feel like it was taking its first proper holiday. A body is told that his word and his work are his whole measure, but standing there watching her bargain for flowers, it struck me that perhaps the two paths weren’t bound for different territories after all. Why, a solemn promise to your own future ought to include a little sunshine, and maybe the truest responsibility a man has is to build a life where such a laugh isn’t a rare visitor, but a permanent and noisy resident.
