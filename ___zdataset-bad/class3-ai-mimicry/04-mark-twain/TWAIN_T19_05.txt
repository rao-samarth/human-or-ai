You take a man like our Judge Abernathy—why, the whole town would swear on a stack of Bibles that his heart is purer than fresh-churned butter. They see him strolling down Main Street, all starched collar and solemn dignity, and they think they’re looking at a pillar of the community; a man so upright he’d likely snap in a stiff breeze. But I’ve seen the way his eyes glitter when a poor widow is begging for leniency, a look that has nothing of mercy in it and a whole lot of calculation. His conscience is as empty as a pauper's collection plate, and his famed virtue is just a fine suit of clothes he puts on for public display. He dispenses justice from that bench like a grocer weighing out rotten potatoes—always giving a little extra to the folks who can pay, and shortchanging the rest. It's a curious thing, how a man can be hollowed out clean as a gourd on the inside, yet the world keeps admiring the shiny shell and swearing it's the finest fruit they ever did see.
