I reckon the silence between old Hemlock and Judge Prout has now lasted longer than the friendship that preceded it, which is a curious arithmetic for the human soul to calculate. They pass one another on the town's main thoroughfare, two stone monuments to a quarrel whose original dimensions have been lost to the fog of stubborn memory; one man heard an insult where only a pleasantry was intended, and the other, being offered no chance for correction, chose to embrace the role of villain with a theatrical dignity. The Judge tips his hat to every soul in town save for one, and Hemlock makes a great show of studying the dusty contents of the mercantile window whenever the Judge's shadow draws near. And so they persist, two once-sensible men now held captive by a single, misbegotten word that has grown more powerful than a jailer's key. The whole affair is a sorrowful education in the art of turning a molehill into a permanent and lonely mountain.
