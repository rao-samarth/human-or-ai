Henderson, bless your innocent heart, but your particular brand of truth-telling is a commercial calamity of the first water. You don't walk up to a fellow and inform him the horse he fancies has got a terminal case of the slows and a disposition fouler than a tax collector's—good heavens, man, where's the art in that? No, you praise his discerning eye, you remark on the animal's noble spirit which a lesser man might mistake for stubbornness, and you make him feel like he's pulling a fast one on *you*. A man will forgive you for taking his last dollar if you let him keep his pride; he’ll thank you for the privilege of the flim-flam. It ain’t about lying, you see, it’s about providing a service—the grand and righteous service of letting a man believe he is cleverer than he actually is, right up to the moment his pockets are empty.
