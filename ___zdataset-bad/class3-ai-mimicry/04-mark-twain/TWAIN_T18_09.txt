The whole affair commenced on account of Mrs. Gable’s new sundial—a monstrous stone edifice shipped all the way from the city, which she insisted must be placed in the dead center of her lawn with a precision usually reserved for the alignment of planets. Jedediah, who fancied himself an engineer because he had once successfully repaired a water pump, was the chief architect of the operation. He had devised a scheme involving three logs for rollers and a system of ropes that looked more suited to rigging a ship than to persuading a block of granite to move ten feet. Silas, for his part, held the conviction that intellect was a poor substitute for main strength, and so the two of them entered into a vigorous and protracted debate—one citing principles of mechanics he’d half-remembered from a pamphlet, the other merely grunting and pointing at his own arms—while the sundial itself sat there, utterly unmoved, looking wiser than the whole lot of us combined.
