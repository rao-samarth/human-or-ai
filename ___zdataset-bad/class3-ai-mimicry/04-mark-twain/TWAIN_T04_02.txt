Uncle Silas and his old partner, Mr. Abernathy, sat on the porch swing, looking for all the world like two ancient turtles that had decided the race wasn't worth the trouble. You could hear the whole family chattering behind them—a regular clatter of gossip and half-baked opinions about politics and pie recipes. Now, I happen to know that not five years ago, Mr. Abernathy’s mercantile venture went belly-up so thoroughly it nearly took my uncle’s savings down with it, a situation that would make most men turn into sworn enemies quicker than milk sours in July. Plenty of folks advised Silas to cut him loose; it was the sensible thing, the profitable thing. But there they sat, sharing a pipe, their silence more companionable than all the noise inside. It strikes a fellow that a bond forged in some high-minded sort of foolishness is a good deal sturdier than one built on cold, hard cash—and a sight more comfortable to rest upon in your twilight years.
