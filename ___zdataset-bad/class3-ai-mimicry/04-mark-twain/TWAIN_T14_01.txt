I saw a fellow down the lane the other day, mending his fence with such a ponderous and self-satisfied air you’d think he was single-handedly holding back the encroachments of chaos itself. He'd talk your ear off about his five-year plan, his particular brand of gumption, and the shrewd decisions that led him to this very patch of dirt—as if he’d personally petitioned the Almighty for each sunrise and negotiated the terms of the rainfall. It’s a fine piece of theater, I’ll grant you that. A man will convince himself he’s steering his own vessel through a hurricane, pointing with pride at the direction he’s going, all the while failing to notice the colossal current underneath that’s been carrying him, his boat, and his fool notions along since the day he was born. He didn't choose the river; he just learned to name the rapids.
