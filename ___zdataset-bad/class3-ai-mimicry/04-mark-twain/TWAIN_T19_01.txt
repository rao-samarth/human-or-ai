A body would look upon that old millpond and reckon it the most peaceful sight in the whole county, its surface as smooth and untroubled as a sleeping babe’s cheek. The sun would dapple it with gold, and a lazy water-strider might skate across without causing a ripple. But Lord, the truth of it was a different matter entirely; down below that glassy skin was a regular war—a silent, desperate business of fish eating smaller fish, of snakes snatching frogs right off their lily pads, of things rotting slow and steady in the black mud at the bottom. All that quiet on the top was just a handsome lie told to the sky, a pretty cover for the mean and hungry struggle that never, ever stops. It’s the same with most folks, I suppose; the prettiest smile can hide the most tormented soul.
