I was occupying a perfectly comfortable chair in the lobby of a fine establishment, minding my own business—which is a full-time occupation for some of us—when a pair of gentlemen commenced a debate nearby. One of them, a fellow with a chest so puffed you could have used it for a sail, insisted that a man is the sole architect of his own grand cathedral of a life. The other, a leaner and more worried-looking specimen, argued that we're all just chips tossed by a storm we can't see, landing where we may. They went back and forth like a shuttlecock, each one absolutely certain he had the Almighty's personal blueprint in his vest pocket. It struck me then that the whole argument is a brand of tomfoolery. A man spends his whole life congratulating himself for steering his raft, never noticing the ten-mile-an-hour current that's been doing all the real work from the start.
