Prithee, do not ask me of the night's repose, for I have found none. A simple errand for a cup of water hath been undone by a conspiracy of household fiends! First, the tabby, with a hunter's pride, didst lay at my feet a mouse of most lamentable aspect, causing me to start and overturn a pail left carelessly by the scullery maid. The ensuing clatter, a sound fit to wake the very dead, roused my uncle from his slumber; who, emerging in his nightshirt with a candle held aloft, did promptly mistake the spilled water for a spectral puddle and, in his fright, tripped upon the selfsame cat. He landed, bless his soul, squarely within a basket of laundry, his limbs askew like a broken puppet's. I know not whether I should first offer aid or die of this surfeit of laughter, for never hath such a simple thirst wrought such magnificent disarray. His sputtering rage is a music to which even the angels, I think, must be chuckling.
