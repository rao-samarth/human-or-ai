So, where now are those lofty words that didst fly from thy lips like arrows from a taut-strung bow, promising such victory as this poor village had ne'er before witnessed? You fashioned yourself a king amongst us common craftsmen, your every utterance a decree on how true skill must look. Yet here thy great work lies, a shattered mess upon the dirt, whilst mine stands praised by all. Answer me, for I would know: what say'st thou now, when the very dust of the square bears witness to thy fall? Thy face, once a mask of high and mighty scorn, is now a pitiable map of ruin. Pray, speak up, for the silence that hangs about thee is a far more eloquent judgment than any I could render.
