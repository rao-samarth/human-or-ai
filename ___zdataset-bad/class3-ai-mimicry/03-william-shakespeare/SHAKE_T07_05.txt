The Baron, his voice made thick with wine and his own consequence, did call upon the young lutanist to play some vulgar jig, a thing to make the groundlings laugh and shame the player’s art. A hush descended, for a nobleman’s whim is a command writ in stone, a current against which no lesser man may swim. All eyes turned to the boy, whose slender fingers yet rested on the silent strings. He did not look upon his master, nor did he make excuse or protestation; he but lowered his head in a bow of such profound and sorrowful grace that it became not an act of submission, but of finality. Then, without a word, he set his instrument with care upon the velvet chair and walked from the great hall. The silence he left behind was a heavier thing than any music, a quiet space wherein the Baron’s authority, so absolute a moment prior, did seem to shrink and wither in the torchlight.
