You bid me speak, and say what devil's art did move me to infect the common folk with thoughts above their station. I answer plain; I gave them but a voice for their own silence, which you, my lords, mistook for peace. For their long quiet was a parched field, and your hard decrees the very stones that choked it. What sorcery was mine? I did but whisper that a sovereign’s command cannot make the sun to rise at midnight, nor fill a starveling’s belly with a proclamation writ on parchment. If to speak such truth be poison, then I have poured it out like water for the thirsty, and would do so yet again. Censure the rain if you will, but know the soil itself is cracked with want, and you are not the masters of the storm that is to come.
