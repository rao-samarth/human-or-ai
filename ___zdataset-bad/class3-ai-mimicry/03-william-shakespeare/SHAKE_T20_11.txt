I stood this afternoon amidst the press of Cheapside, where a certain merchant’s wife, a creature of formidable piety and even more formidable corsetry, held forth to her companions. Lord, how she did lament the city’s lack of Christian feeling, her voice a very trumpet for the cause of the downtrodden, and swore that her own heart bled for the wretched souls who knew not whence their next meal might come. A fine sermon, forsooth! Yet scarce had the words departed her lips when a ragged urchin, all eyes and bones, did but tug upon her sleeve for a farthing; whereupon she struck his hand away with her fan as if he were some foul contagion, crying out upon the insolence of beggars. Methinks her charity resides entirely upon her tongue, and fears to make the perilous journey to her purse.
