Hark, how a simple word, well-planted, doth sprout such bitter fruit! I did but breathe a notion, a mere whisper in the ear of a credulous dame, that our host’s lauded vintage owed its parentage not to the grape but to the gooseberry, and a sour one at that. Forsooth, a fiction spun from naught but air and envy. Yet see how this new-forged verity hath taken root amongst the company! My lady clutches at her stomach, feigning a sudden malady; that portly knight, whose thirst is legend, now eyes his full goblet as if it held a serpent’s venom. They shift upon their cushions, their faces pinched with a counterfeit distress, whilst their poor host stands confounded, wondering why his prized nectar meets with such cold regard. A single, artful lie, and I am made the master of their bellies and their wills without so much as lifting a finger to the deed.
