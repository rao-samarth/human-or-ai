Mark well the strange arithmetic of our town, wherein a man's worth is not reckoned by his soul's good content, but by the cut of his doublet and the name he doth inherit. The selfsame jest that from a labourer's mouth would earn a cuff or scornful stare, if spoken by yon young gentleman, is hailed as wit most rare and keen. The baker gives to him the choicest loaf, though his coin be no better than mine own; the constable, who would clap a poorer man in stocks for a lesser fault, doth but smile and bow, forgiving all ere the transgression is full-formed. This deference is a silent river that flows ever from the small to the great, a current unseen yet so potent it may part the very crowds, for they make a path for such a one without command or spoken plea, as if his mere presence were a proclamation.
