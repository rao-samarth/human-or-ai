I stand before you, though no high court be assembled here, and confess a stain upon my soul that every passing face in this small parish seems to know; for in their averted gaze and whispered greetings, I see the very image of my own foul deceit. Alas, I made a promise to a trusting heart and broke it ere the ink was dry upon the page. Now doth this inward judge, this ceaseless accuser in my mind, hold its own grim assize, condemning me with evidence I cannot refute, for my own memory is the chiefest witness to the crime. Sleep offers no reprieve, but serves a stage for phantom reckonings, and every bell that tolls from the old steeple seems to sound my name, a wretch who poisoned fellowship for a moment’s gain. Tell me, what penance can scour such a blot from a man’s ledger, when the coin of his repentance is deemed counterfeit by his own heart?
