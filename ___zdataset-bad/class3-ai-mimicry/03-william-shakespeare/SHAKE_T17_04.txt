The master's dispatch was writ in haste, its meaning clouded by a hurried pen. The clerk, a man of careful but not cunning wit, did construe its purpose to be the opposite of what was meant; he saw an order to sell where he should have held, and acting on this grievous misprision, he let go the bonds that secured the whole enterprise. When his master did return and saw the ledger's ruin, he spake not of the letter's fault, but of the clerk's own treasonous folly. What answer could the poor man give? To claim the words were ill-formed was to accuse his master of a flaw, a charge no servant dares to make. Thus, a simple scrawl, a moment's want of clarity, did sunder a trust of twenty years and cast a good man out, his name forever stained by a phantom betrayal.
