Pray, condemn me not with such swift and certain looks, for what man amongst you can truly claim to be the sole author of his own miserable tale? We are as dice, I think, cast from a careless fist upon the gaming board of the world; we tumble and we turn, believing each new face we show to be a choice, a grand design of our own making. A man may lay his plans with the precision of a master builder, setting stone upon careful stone, only to find the earth itself doth quake and swallow all his labour. What then becomes of his will, his industry, his forethought? It is naught but dust. Tell me, then, am I the sinner for the path I walked, or was the path itself laid down by a force I could neither see nor defy, compelling my feet toward this sorry end?
