Hark, how my father’s praise doth shower upon my brother's head, whilst I, his elder, stand a barren tree in winter's shade. Each word of favour given him is a sharp stone cast at me, a public declaration of my lesser worth within these very halls. He smiles, that easy, unearned smile, and knows not of the bitter gall that rises in my throat; he sees but loving kin, where I perceive a court of judges passing sentence on my soul. They toast his small success, a trifle bought with fortune's coin, yet my long labours, born of sweat and midnight oil, do pass unseen, like fleeting shadows on the wall. I fear the poison of this humour shall consume me whole, for with every cheer for him, my own heart shrinks, and I feel my rightful place in this house, and in my father's love, slip from me like a thief into the night.
