The road that stretches hence, when viewed from this high place, doth seem a silken ribbon, lain gently upon the breast of the earth; yet when we descend to walk its length, its true aspect is revealed, a course of rutted stone and choking dust, a trial for any weary foot. And so it is, I find, with many things encountered on this world’s pilgrimage. What at a distance promises fair passage and a sweet repose may prove, upon a closer reckoning, a thing of hardship and sharp vexation. That tranquil stream, whose placid surface gives back the sun’s own gold, conceals a current swift enough to drag a strong man to his end; and the deep wood that beckons with its cooling shade oft harbours the biting thorn and unseen coil. We are much deceived by the eye’s first report, for nature herself puts on a pleasing mask to hide the sterner countenance that lies beneath.
