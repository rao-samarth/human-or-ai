Prithee, look upon me and still thy shifting gaze. Hath the great man’s gilded whisper so turned thy head that all our shared history now weighs as nothing? I see in thee a strange and sudden distance, as if our sworn brotherhood, once a fortress against the world’s unkindness, hath become a cramped and humble lodging thou art keen to quit for a palace. Dost thou truly measure my long-proven faith against his new-found favour, placing them on a scale to see which tips with the heavier gold? Speak plain, for this quiet calculation in thine eyes doth wound me more deeply than any open treason. A spoken word, though it be a dagger, can be answered; but a silent turning of the heart leaves a man to fight with shadows and with fears.
