Though the bailiff's law, a thing of ink and wax, did straitly charge that no man's hand should turn the soil of Paddock Meadow save for his master's gain, a sweeter law hath now been writ upon the earth itself. For where his ravenous sheep were meant to graze alone, a thousand hopeful shoots now greet the sun, each one a whispered word against his pride. No sword was drawn, nor angry voice was raised in clamour at the manor gate; nay, only spades in the soft hush of dusk, and seeds of poppy, cornflower, and of grain, cast by a common and unshakeable will. And in this secret husbandry there lives a joyful promise: that even the sternest will must bend at last, not to the force of arms, but to the gentle, stubborn growth of what is right, which, given but a little earth and time, shall surely blossom and bear fruit for all.
