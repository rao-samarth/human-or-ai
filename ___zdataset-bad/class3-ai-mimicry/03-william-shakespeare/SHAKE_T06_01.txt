Prithee, look how Master Giles doth strut about the market square, his purse so heavy it nigh pulls his breeches down. Whence comes this sudden fortune? Not a month past, he was a man like me, his boots worn thin and his supper a meager thing; yet now he greets the alderman as an equal, and his wife, a plain-faced wench before, doth sport a ribbon of French silk in her hair. I cannot suffer the sight. A bitter bile doth rise within my throat when I behold his easy smile, for I know his wit to be a dull and blunted tool, and his labours no more honest than my own. There is some foul play here, I am certain of it; some secret pact or stolen inheritance must be the root of this gaudy flower. For heaven doth not reward a simpleton so, unless the devil himself hath lent a hand in the planting.
