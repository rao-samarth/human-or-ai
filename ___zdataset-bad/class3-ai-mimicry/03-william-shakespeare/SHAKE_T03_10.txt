Hold thy tongue, sir, lest it carve thy path to a swift and sorry end! This scurrilous tale thou dost whisper, this venom of retreat and craven fear, is a poison meant not for my body, but for that immortal part of me which men call my good name. What foolishness possesses thee to think I would permit such a blot to mar the legacy my father gave me, a thing more precious than all his lands and titles? By all that is holy, I would sooner cast myself from this horse and perish on these stones than live a single hour in the shadow of such infamy. You have uttered a slander that can only be answered in steel, and before this day is done, you shall give me satisfaction, or I shall have it from your very life.
