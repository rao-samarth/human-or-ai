Methinks there is no greater sport than to observe the grand designs of men undone by trifles. I stood but yesterday at my cousin’s board, where her husband, a man whose belly doth precede him by a goodly measure, rose to make a speech of most tedious length. He held his script aloft, prepared to inflict upon us all some windy oration on virtue, when his wife’s own pampered lapdog, a creature smaller than his shoe, did leap upon the table. With a yelp of triumph, it snatched the parchment from his very hand and fled beneath a press of skirts and legs. What a clamour then arose! The great man, red of face and sputtering oaths, gave chase upon his knees, whilst the ladies shrieked, and the dog, for its part, tore his solemn prose to shreds with merry abandon. His great pronouncements were thus turned to confetti, a fate, I vow, far more fitting for their worth.
