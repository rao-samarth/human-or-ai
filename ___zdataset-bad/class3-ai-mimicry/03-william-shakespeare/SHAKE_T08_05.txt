This rattling cart doth vex the bones, yet gives the mind no peace from its own troubled jolting. They speak of scales, of weights made true by some blindfolded woman in a marble hall; a pretty thought, forsooth, for men whose purses are full and whose kin are safe abed. But when the wound is thine own flesh, and the thief who made it walks free in daylight, what then becomes of measure? Hath God not given us passions for a cause, or is this fire in the belly but an accident of temper? I think it a holy instrument, a righteous fever meant to purge the world of such a pestilence. Let the law-men keep their dusty books and careful ink, for mine own account shall be writ in a starker colour upon the man himself. His debt will be paid in a coin all men understand, though few dare speak its name aloud upon the King’s highway.
