So you would have me say my own will did fashion this dark outcome, that I alone did steer the vessel onto such calamitous rocks? I tell you, sir, I was but a man caught in a sudden tide. Consider how all things conspired against a better end: the ill-timed letter, the servant’s careless tongue, a sudden fever that did keep a wiser counsel from my door. Doth a man choose the storm that breaks upon his roof, or the sickness that invades his blood? Nay, fortune sets the stage and furnishes the scene with its own cruel props, and we, poor actors, are thrust upon it to speak a part we never learned. My hand may have moved the final piece, 'tis true, but the game was set by a craftier power long ere I was bid to play, and every path before me led to this same sorry checkmate.
