The carriage wheels do groan upon the rutted track, a mournful song that finds its echo in my breast. For though my body moves towards some distant, hopeful shore, my soul stays ever fixed upon that darker coast I left behind, a place now poisoned by my deed. What peace is there in motion, when the mind is anchored fast to such a wretched memory? A whispered word, a trust undone; these things are not so light as breath, but are as leaden weights that sink a man into despair's deepest pit. Each jolt and shudder of this weary frame doth but remind me of the tremor in her voice, ere silence fell between us for all time. My own heart plays the merciless accuser, and in the court of night, where none but shadows sit as jury, I am pronounced villain a thousand times ere dawn doth break upon my sleepless eyes.
