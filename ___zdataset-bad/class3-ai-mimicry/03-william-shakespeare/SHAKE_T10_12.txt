Hark, you speak of honesty, yet what coin is this you press into my palm? ’Tis but a sliver of the whole, a gilded piece of what was once a golden truth. You serve me but the crusts of the loaf and swear it is the entire meal! Wherefore dost thou keep the rest concealed? I see it in thy shifting eye; I hear it in the careful measure of thy words. Thou art a merchant of half-meanings, a juggler of circumstance, who shows the crowd one shining ball whilst three more hide behind thy back. Nay, answer me not with more shadows. You have built a cage for my reason, its bars wrought from the very facts you chose to give me, and locked the gate with those you chose to hold. By heaven, I’ll not be so penned in! Unbar the gate, or I shall break it down and find what you so fear to show.
