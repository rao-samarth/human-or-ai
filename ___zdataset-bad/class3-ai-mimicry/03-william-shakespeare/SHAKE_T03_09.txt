Halt this carriage, I say, and turn it from this muddy track at once! Wherefore dost thou stare so, as if I were some fever’d madman crying at the moon? That knave we passed at the crossroads, with his sneering tongue and company of fools, did cast a stain upon my lineage, a lie so venomous it curdles the very air I breathe. You bid me let it pass, to count it as the idle wind that troubles not the mighty oak; but my good name is no mere timber to withstand such rot. It is the only coin I truly possess, the legacy my father gave me when all his lands were forfeit. Let our destination wait, and let our purpose be delayed. I shall not take another step upon this path until that man hath eaten his foul words, or my sword hath taught his lying throat a final, silent lesson.
