The master’s question hangs yet in the air, a baited hook for my integrity, whilst I stare upon this ledger. He asks what fault I find, and his eye tells me what answer he desires; a fault not of the coin, but of the man who tallied it. For here the truth is but a paltry thing, a miswrit cipher, an error born of haste and nothing more. Yet, if I frame it so? If I present this speck of dust as if it were a canker on the rose, and with a feigned sigh speak of a pattern where there is but simple chance? I might, with but a cunning turn of phrase and a shadow of a doubt well-placed, unseat a rival from his perch and win myself a warmer place. My tongue, it seems, must be either a true glass, reflecting what is plain, or a sharp tool to carve what is to be, and I know not which will cost me more.
