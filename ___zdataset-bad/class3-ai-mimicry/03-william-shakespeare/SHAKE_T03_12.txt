You see me here, my friend, and judge me pale in the flickering candlelight; you ask what heavy matter doth so weigh upon my soul. For weeks, a villain’s breath hath sullied all I hold dear, spreading such a pestilence of lies that my very name became a curse upon the lips of neighbours. Was I to let this canker grow, to see the honour of my father and his father before him dragged through the common mire? Nay, I could not. A good report is the only coin that outlives the flesh, the very soul of a man's continuance on this earth. And so, I sought him out where he conspired, and with a swift and silent justice, I did purchase back my peace. Let God above be my witness and my judge; I have but scoured a stain from the fabric of my house, a duty which no man of worth could shirk.
