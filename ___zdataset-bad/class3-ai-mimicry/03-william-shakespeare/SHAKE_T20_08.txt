Yonder, where the willow weeps into the brook, our parson takes his solitary walk, his holy book now laid aside. His morning’s lesson, still a fresh-plucked flower in the mind, spoke with a honeyed tongue of worlds renounced and treasures stored where moth and rust corrupt not. Yet mark how his keen eye doth now possess the fields, numbering his worldly riches one by one; his brow, which late was raised in pious prayer, is furrowed with a most grievous care for one fat lamb that strays from the main fold. He preaches of a kingdom not of men, but measures out his own with every careful step. A soul so torn ‘twixt God and earthly gain must find its peace, I think, in neither realm, but wanders ever in this purgatory of its own design, finding no comfort in the heaven he describes nor in the earth he so fears to lose.
