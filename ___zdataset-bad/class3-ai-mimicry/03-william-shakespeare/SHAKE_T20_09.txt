My good uncle sits, a mountain of a man, and speaks of fasting as a balm for the soul, all whilst his jowls glisten with the fat of a third capon. He doth praise the virtues of an empty purse, how it brings a man nearer to heaven, yet his own fingers, heavy with gaudy rings, can scarce lift the wine to his lips. Oh, the world's a stage of fools indeed, where he who preaches abstinence is the first to the feast! He chides my younger cousin for a single idle hour, speaking of industry as God's own prayer, when all his fortune was but the fruit of his father's sweat, a legacy he guards with a miser's key. Prithee, what painted mockery is this, that we must nod and smile at such a sermon, delivered from a throne of gluttony? It doth make a philosopher of a simple nephew, to see such a hollow vessel make the loudest sound.
