Master Giles, his purse so heavy it bent his posture to a strut, paraded his new-bought carriage through the dusty square. "Mark ye well," he boomed at Thomas the cooper, who stood nearby wiping his hands upon his apron, "what true substance can procure! A chariot of such fine and sturdy make, its like hath ne'er been seen in this poor village." He slapped the lacquered door, a sound like a single, proud clap of thunder. "My journeys shall be swift, my comfort absolute, whilst thou art left to plod upon the earth." Yet as he gave the whip a mighty crack to make his grand departure, a forward wheel caught fast upon a jutting cobble and with a groan of splintering wood, the axle gave its ghost. The whole affair toppled, casting the great man into a puddle of muck and horse-droppings, his fine silks now a coat of common filth. Thomas turned to his friend and murmured low, "His high estate did not preserve him from a low landing, it seems."
