Hark, how my uncle doth again unspool his well-worn yarn, trimming a plain truth here and there embroidering a glorious fancy, all to make his own part shine the brighter in the telling. The gathered kin do nod, as is their custom; some from simple habit, others fearing to disturb the shallow peace of this our feast. But lo, across the long table, I catch my cousin’s eye, and in its lively glimmer see a knowing spark, a silent jest we two do share alone! His painted words, that once did hold our younger minds with their great sound and fury, are now but hollow echoes in the hall, their brittle magic fled at last. For truth, I see, though it be whispered low between two souls, hath a far greater music and a sturdier heart than any falsehood shouted from the highest chair, and in that quiet glance a truer bond is forged than all his chronicles could ever build.
