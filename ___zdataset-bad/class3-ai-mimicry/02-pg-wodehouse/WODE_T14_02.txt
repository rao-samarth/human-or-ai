I was propped in a corner of my aunt’s drawing-room, observing the proceedings with the sort of detached interest one gives a play one has seen a few too many times. Young Cecil was holding forth—as he is rather inclined to do after a second sherry—about his five-year plan for conquering the jute market. He spoke with the magnificent certainty of a chap who imagines himself at the tiller of his own ship, stoutly steering for a chosen port. And yet, watching him, one couldn’t help but see the hundred invisible strings attached to the poor blighter. There was the string of his father’s expectations, pulling him towards the City; the string of what a girl named Penelope might want, tugging him suburb-wards; and the great, thick hawser of sheer, dumb luck that could snap it all or tow him somewhere else entirely. He was a cork, you see, bobbing on a tide he couldn't even perceive, and all his energetic paddling seemed a rather sad sort of joke in the face of it.
