Boffington cornered me by the water cooler, his expression that of a spaniel which has just been informed that walks are cancelled indefinitely. "My dear boy," he murmured, adjusting his tie with a trembling hand, "regarding the final figures for the Peabody account—a trifling discrepancy, you understand." I understood perfectly; the discrepancy was about as trifling as a rhinoceros in a telephone box, and it had Boffington’s fingerprints all over it. "I was thinking," he continued, leaning in so closely I could count his nostril hairs, "that in the spirit of departmental cohesion, we might present a united front. A joint mea culpa, as it were." I confess the proposition turned the soul a bit blue. To have one’s own pristine calculations lumped in with his brand of creative arithmetic was a dashed sight more than a fellow could stand. "I'm frightfully sorry, Boffington," I said, backing away towards the relative safety of my desk, "but one’s abacus is a sacred trust. I can't very well claim responsibility for a sum that adds two and two and gets a lemon."
