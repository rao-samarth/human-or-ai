"You gave your word, Bertram," Honoria said, and her voice had taken on that steely quality generally reserved by headmasters for addressing boys caught smoking behind the cricket pavilion. "A gentleman's word is his bond. The family expects it. Your father expects it. *I* expect it." She ticked off these expectations on her fingers as if they were items on a grocery list, each one another nail in the coffin of my personal liberty. I nodded sagely, trying to look like a chap whose bond was as good as the Bank of England's, but it was a stiff task. My mind, a pesky and disloyal organ at the best of times, kept skittering off to thoughts of Cynthia—her laugh, the way she crinkled her nose, the whole delightful ensemble. It was like being told by one's doctor to stick to dry toast and water while a vision of a sizzling steak with all the trimmings floats before your very eyes. One knows what one *should* do, of course, but the spirit weakens and the heart does a bit of a song and dance in entirely the wrong direction.
