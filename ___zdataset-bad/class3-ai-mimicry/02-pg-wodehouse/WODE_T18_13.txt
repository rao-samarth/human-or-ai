My only object, you understand, was to execute a civil nod towards a chap I was morally certain I’d known at school—a tall fellow with the sort of ears that suggested a recent and unsuccessful argument with a taxicab door. I had just raised my hat a fraction when a sudden gust, one of those malevolent city zephyrs that lurk in wait for the unwary, conspired with a passing bicycle-messenger who, in swerving to avoid a pigeon of suicidal intent, managed to intercept my headgear mid-flight upon a precariously balanced stack of pastry boxes. The whole affair was over in a jiffy. I was left standing bare-headed, bowing to a complete stranger who was now eyeing me as if I were a dangerous new form of mushroom, while my best bowler hat proceeded serenely down Piccadilly atop a cargo of what I can only assume were assorted buns and éclairs. One simply doesn't have a plan for that sort of contingency.
