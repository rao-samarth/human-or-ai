The roar of the city thoroughfare was, as a general rule, a tonic to the system, but on this particular afternoon it struck the ear with all the cheer of a dropped tray in a morgue. Each bleating motor-horn seemed to single one out, delivering a curt, personal reprimand. It was the luncheon, you see. Old Blevins had hailed one’s suggestion for the automatic dog-walker prospectus as a stroke of pure, unadulterated genius, and the assembled syndicate had practically carried one from the table shoulder-high. The snag, and a confoundedly jagged one it was, lay in the fact that the entire brilliant notion had sprung fully-formed from the brow of my cousin Agatha over tea and muffins last Tuesday. A small, persistent voice, rather like a butler announcing that the bailiffs have arrived, had taken up residence in my interior and refused to be evicted. It kept pointing out that while I was lapping up the glory, poor Agatha was most likely at home, attempting to teach her Pekinese to appreciate modern verse, blissfully unaware of the grand larceny. It’s a rum go when success leaves a fellow feeling like a pilfered haddock.
