It was well past the witching hour, and the only sound in the great, sleeping edifice was the soft sloshing of the restorative in my glass as I paced the library carpet. The question before the board, so to speak, was what to do about my cousin Herbert. One school of thought, championed largely by one’s better self, suggested that the scales of right and wrong ought to be balanced by a higher authority—Uncle Percy, for instance, a man whose word was law and whose pronouncements carried the weight of a ton of bricks. A stern talking-to would ensue, a chap would be vindicated, and all would be tickety-boo. But another, more persuasive inner voice, the one with a distinct twinkle in its eye, whispered of a far more direct approach involving a bar of soap, the linoleum outside Herbert’s bedroom door, and the deep, satisfying knowledge that the blighter who had hidden your best spats got precisely what was coming to him, administered personally and with no middlemen.
