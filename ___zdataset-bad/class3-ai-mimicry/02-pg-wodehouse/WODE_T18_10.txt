There is a profound, if seldom studied, principle at work in any densely populated thoroughfare, which dictates that the potential for public disarray increases exponentially with the earnestness of the individual. I witnessed a perfect demonstration only yesterday. A fellow, whose bowler hat alone bespoke a man of sober habits, was attempting to retrieve a wayward sovereign from the pavement—a perfectly reasonable ambition. Yet his sudden lunge caused a cyclist to swerve; the cyclist, in avoiding him, clipped the precarious fruit-stand of an Italian gentleman; and the resulting avalanche of oranges, rolling with a sort of cheerful malevolence across the street, brought no fewer than two omnibuses and a delivery van to a juddering halt. The original fellow, sovereign now forgotten, simply stared at the sea of citrus he had unleashed, a minor Napoleon surveying a battlefield of his own accidental making. It was all quite logical, when you broke it down.
