It was a dashed peculiar business, finding oneself alone in a kitchen after midnight, confronted by a small, gleaming box that purported to toast bread. The thing sat there with a sort of polished impertinence, quite as if it knew a fellow of my sort ought to have his toasted soldiers delivered on a tray by a chap in livery, not to be wrestling with the sordid mechanics of their creation himself. My man, Finch, could have wrangled the device with a flick of the wrist, no doubt, but Finch was enjoying his well-earned slumber, and there are certain protocols a chap simply doesn’t breach. Rousing the staff for a nocturnal snack is the sort of thing that, as my Aunt Honoria was fond of booming, “unravels the whole shooting-match.” One moment you’re asking for a slice of toast, the next they’re critiquing your choice of waistcoat and borrowing your finest single malt. The entire delicate equilibrium goes right out the window, you see.
