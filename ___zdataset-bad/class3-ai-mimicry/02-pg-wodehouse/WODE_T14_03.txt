"My dear chap," boomed old Freddie Threepwood, striking an attitude by the salmon mousse that suggested a Roman emperor who’d just had a particularly satisfactory lunch, "a man is the architect of his own fortunes! He lays the bricks, so to speak, and cements the mortar." He directed this pronouncement at his niece, Agatha, a girl with a steely glint in her eye and a jawline that could have been used to open tins. She gave a small, dangerous smile. "An architect, Uncle? I rather thought you were more like a man who, having tripped over a loose paving stone and landed head-first in a sack of banknotes, stands up and claims to have invented gravity and the principles of finance in a single, brilliant moment." The silence that followed was of a quality you don't often find outside a Trappist monastery, thick and profound, and Freddie’s face took on the colour and expression of a deeply startled lobster.
