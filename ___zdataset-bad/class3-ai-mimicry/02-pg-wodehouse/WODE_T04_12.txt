It was well past two in the morning, an hour when only owls and the more determined sort of burglar are generally up and about, and I was beginning to regret that last Welsh rarebit. There was Sidney, you see, creeping across the library rug on tiptoe, his entire aspect that of a man who has spotted a venomous snake in his bath and is debating the correct fork to use. The object of his slinking was the mahogany desk where his Uncle Alistair’s correspondence lay in a neat pile. Specifically, one rather plump envelope which, Sidney had confided in me over a final whisky, he had a ghastly suspicion contained the new will—a will in which his name was likely to feature with all the prominence of a footnote in a history of Byzantine pottery. He was now hovering over the thing, a kettle steaming gently on a nearby trivet, and I found myself in the sort of pickle that gives a chap pause. To pipe up and remind him that gentlemen don't, as a rule, steam open other gentlemen's mail felt frightfully preachy, yet to sit there and watch him do the dirty deed felt… well, it felt dashed complicit, if you take my meaning. What, I asked myself, was a fellow to do?
