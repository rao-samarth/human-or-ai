It was the steady, penetrating glare from across the shimmering damask that truly curdled the consommé for me. Old Lady Hemlock, whose expression suggested she’d just discovered a slug in her salad—and suspected me of putting it there—was broadcasting to the room at large that I was not a man to be trusted with a book of stamps, let alone the five shillings she claimed I owed from that disastrous bet on the parson’s prize-winning marrow. The sum was, of course, a piffle. A mere bagatelle. But the principle of the thing, dash it all, was monumental. To be thought a welsher, a low fellow who dodges his obligations, was a blot on the family escutcheon of the deepest dye. I could hardly let it stand, yet causing a scene amid the crystal and chatter seemed an equally ghastly alternative. A chap’s good name, I reflected glumly, is a frightfully expensive thing to maintain, often costing far more than the original five shillings in question.
