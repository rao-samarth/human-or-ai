You ask why poor old Uncle Percy has taken to his bed with a dampened towel upon his brow, and the answer, my dear chap, lies in the minutes of the Little Wittering Parish Council. You see, this Pringle fellow, a man with the soul of a chartered accountant and the face of a lightly boiled egg, had performed a bit of jiggery-pokery with the official record. My uncle had merely offered the mild suggestion that the existing village pond was a trifle congested for the local waterfowl—a perfectly harmless observation, you’ll agree—only to find it recorded in Pringle’s spidery script as a “full-throated demand for a vast aquatic metropolis, to be funded by a compulsory levy on all garden gnomes.” The result, of course, was that Percy went from being a respected pillar of the community to a man pointed at in the street by irate gnome-fanciers, all because Pringle had decided to serve up the truth with a side-order of utter balderdash. It’s a dashed rum way to conduct public affairs, if you ask me.
