Now, touching on the matter of young Binkerton’s missing silver trophy, I feel a full and frank statement is in order. I’ll grant you that the sight of him preening on the dais did something peculiar to my internal organs; it was as if a small, particularly disgruntled octopus had taken up residence just south of the waistcoat and was squirting a rather bilious ink. The blighter simply has too much good fortune, and watching him accept yet another bit of shiny hardware whilst flashing that ghastly, toothy smile of his—well, it’s enough to make a chap question the fundamental fairness of the cosmos. My only intention, I assure you, was to inspect the engraving up close, a perfectly reasonable bit of scientific curiosity. But then old Aunt Agatha cornered me with a frightful monologue on the subject of her lumbago, and in the ensuing confusion, the object seems to have found its way into the interior of that rather large potted fern. One simply has to put these things *somewhere*, after all.
