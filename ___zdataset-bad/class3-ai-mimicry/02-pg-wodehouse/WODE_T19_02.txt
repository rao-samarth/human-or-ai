To see my Uncle Alistair holding court by the fireplace, one might have mistaken him for a chap who’d breakfasted on broken bottles and wrestled bears for sport. His pronouncements on the lamentable state of modern topiary boomed across the drawing-room, causing the teacups to rattle in their saucers and nervy second cousins to nod with a brisk, terrified agreement. He looked, for all the world, like a man whose soul was forged in the unyielding crucible of high finance; a fellow you wouldn't ask for a light without a notarized letter from your solicitor. And yet, I happened to know—owing to a carelessly misdirected letter I'd been asked to forward—that this titan of commerce spent his evenings in a state of high dudgeon if his latest submission to *Tiny Hamster Fancier's Weekly* was not given pride of place on the correspondence page. It rather changed one's perspective on his views regarding the Gold Standard, I can tell you.
