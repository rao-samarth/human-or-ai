It was one of those late, golden afternoons in the garden, the sort that seems to exist purely for quiet reflection and the slow turning of a page. Old Finch, who attended to the delphiniums with a sort of mournful diligence, had paused in his labours, and for a moment a peculiar stillness settled between us as we watched a wasp bothering a fallen pear. I was on the very brink of venturing some light, comradely observation—the sort of thing one chap might say to another about the general persistence of wasps—when he seemed to remember himself. He straightened his back, which made a soft creaking sound, and touched the brim of his hat with a earthy finger. “Begging your pardon, sir,” he murmured, his gaze fixed on some middle distance just over my shoulder, and the little bridge of shared silence between us simply dissolved. There was nothing for it but to nod and retreat, feeling profoundly that an invisible line had been drawn afresh on the lawn, quite as definite as the one his mower had made that morning.
