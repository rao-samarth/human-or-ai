He had one of those firm, jutting jaws that you see on statues of Roman emperors, and he faced the choppy waves with a sort of rugged nonchalance that spoke of a lifetime spent wrestling with the elements and coming out on top. A stern, purposeful sort of chap, his gaze fixed upon the heaving grey of the Channel as if daring it to do its worst. It was only when the vessel gave a particularly impertinent lurch that the facade began, as it were, to wobble. A faint, glassy look entered his eyes, and his complexion, hitherto a robust and weather-beaten pink, shifted to a curious shade of billiard-table green. The granite jaw slackened, the purposeful squint dissolved into a look of pure, unadulterated panic, and with a small, despairing whimper he made a sudden, unstatesmanlike dash for the nearest convenience, a sharp lesson on the folly of judging a man's inner equilibrium by the magnificence of his outerwear.
