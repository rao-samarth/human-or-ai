Aunt Millicent fixed me with the sort of gimlet-eyed stare that could curdle milk at fifty paces, and I confess I quailed. One feels, on these occasions, rather like a chinchilla that has inadvertently wandered into a convention of taxidermists. It had all started with the best of intentions, you see—a simple, harmless bit of puffery regarding my supposed mastery of fourteenth-century battle standards, a subject on which my entire knowledge could, I now freely admit, be written on the back of a postage stamp with ample room left for a short novel. Who was to know that crusty old Sir Humphrey collected the dashed things and would immediately spot that my ‘Gules, a lion rampant or’ was, in fact, more of a sickly yellow poodle couchant on a field of tomato soup? It does rather put a spanner in the works, doesn’t it, when the foundations of one’s carefully constructed persona turn out to be made of jellied eels.
