It’s a rummy business, this city life; you never know what’s what. Take the chap I saw this morning, propped up against a lamp-post near the Strand, looking for all the world like a man who breakfasts on stock tickers and fires his own valet for fun. A proper captain of industry, I thought to myself—all stern jaw and pinstripes, barking into one of those new-fangled telephone things with an air of command that could curdle milk at fifty paces. I was just mentally tipping my hat to this titan of commerce, this Napoleon of the financial district, when a stray gust of wind brought his actual words to my ear. “No, I absolutely did not forget the chutney, Agatha,” the great man bellowed, his face a thundercloud. “It’s in the bag with the bally soda bread! Check again!” It quite took the wind out of my sails, I must admit. One moment you're admiring a lion of the business world, the next you're discovering he's merely a cog in some domestic machine, and a frightfully agitated one at that.
