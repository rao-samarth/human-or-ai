My dear boy, while I applaud the native gusto with which you've attempted to scale the ladder of commerce, it's becoming increasingly clear that, in your haste, you’ve not so much taken a short-cut through the shrubbery as blundered head-first into the prize-winning petunias. Sir Reginald is, to put it mildly, perturbed. It’s not so much the ruse with the racing-pigeon syndicate—he rather admired the pluck of it, I gather—but the fact that in executing this masterstroke, you seem to have trodden rather squarely upon the sensitive feelings of his favourite niece. Still, it’s not a complete wash-out! A chap with your vim hasn't bungled it beyond repair, not by a long chalk. The edifice of your future hasn't crumbled, it's merely developed a bit of a list. A sincere word, a well-chosen bouquet, and a firm promise to stick to the garden path in future ought to see the whole rum business smoothed over before you can say 'What-ho'.
