There he was, my cousin Reginald, laying out the situation on the polished mahogany between us. He had all the component parts of the narrative, to be sure, but arranged them with a rather chilling artistry. Each little truth was present and correct, yet the finished article was a wholly different animal—a beast of an altogether more sinister stripe. The one or two vital details he happened to omit—a promise here, a quiet assurance there—were left to starve in the cold, unmentioned, while the bits that painted me as the architect of my own mild downfall were given pride of place and polished to a high sheen. And all the while his voice was so calm, so terribly reasonable, that to protest would have sounded like the squawk of a hysterical goose. I merely nodded, watching the light catch the decanter, and felt a quiet sort of draining away inside, as if he were not merely recounting the past but actively pilfering it.
