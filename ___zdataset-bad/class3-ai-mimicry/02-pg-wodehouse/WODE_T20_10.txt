Sir Roderick Pumble had just been favouring us with a rather soupy monologue on the sacred kinship between man and beast—how we must, you see, respect every bounding, burrowing, and bewhiskered denizen of the fields. A fine sentiment, and one he delivered with a sort of moist-eyed reverence, causing young Agatha to sniffle into her parasol. It was precisely at this moment that a small, fluffy-tailed rabbit, evidently not a paid-up subscriber to these views, hopped out from the shrubbery and began to nibble, with what I can only describe as flagrant nonchalance, at the edge of one of Sir Roderick’s prize-winning lettuces. The change in the old boy was electric. All that guff about sacred kinship vanished like a puff of smoke in a hurricane, replaced by a purple-faced fury that was frankly terrifying to behold. Uttering a strangled cry that sounded like a cat being stepped on, he seized a nearby garden hoe and shot across the lawn with the sort of vengeful velocity you wouldn't think a man of his tonnage could achieve, the very picture of a chap whose most cherished ideals have just collided head-on with a salad ingredient.
