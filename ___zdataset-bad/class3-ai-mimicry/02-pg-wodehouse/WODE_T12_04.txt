It was during the lulls in the after-dinner conversation, when old Sir Roderick was holding forth on the lamentable state of modern polo ponies, that the notion first shimmered into my head. The little beastly thought, I mean, the one that suggested that the small, leather-bound notebook currently resting on the mantelpiece—left there with a casual, “Keep an eye on this, what?” by my host before he trotted off to find more port—might contain the very solution to my financial embarrassments. It wasn't theft, precisely, as the inner voice of my better self was quick to point out, but more of a temporary, unauthorised loan of information. A quick peek, a scribbled note on a cuff, and the book returned to its spot, no one the wiser. What harm could there be in a chap simply arming himself with a bit of the insider knowledge that seemed to fall like rain on everyone else? The ayes, I must admit, had it rather overwhelmingly, and the old conscience was bundled out of the room before it could even table a proper motion.
