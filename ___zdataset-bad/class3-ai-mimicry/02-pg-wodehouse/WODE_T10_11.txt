I was halfway through a rather commendable crumpet at the Aerated Bread Company when the conversation from the neighbouring table began to curdle the air. It was a ghastly, mesmerising performance. The fellow, a chap with a voice as smooth and treacherous as buttered linoleum, wasn't so much telling falsehoods as he was arranging the truth with the meticulous care of a museum curator positioning a particularly damning fossil. The poor girl opposite him, a slip of a thing who looked as if a stiff breeze might cause her to disintegrate entirely, was absorbing it all with wide, miserable eyes. "Of course he mentioned your name," the man soothed, patting her hand, "but one must consider the *context*, my dear—the laughter in the room, the lightness of the hour." He presented each fact like a small, perfectly formed stone, withholding the cement of circumstance that gave it its actual meaning, until he had built a formidable wall of misery around her, all without uttering a single verifiable lie. It was the sort of manoeuvre that made you want to applaud the sheer artistry of the thing, even as you reached for the nearest blunt instrument.
