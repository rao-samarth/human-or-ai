It’s a rummy business, this whole notion of putting the world to rights, particularly when observed over the rim of a lukewarm sherry. You see a chap like young Wilbraham, puffed up like a pouter pigeon that’s just discovered its own reflection, preening over having got old Sir Jasper’s prize-winning marrow disqualified on a rather footling technicality. He calls it balancing the scales, a fine and noble phrase, but anyone with an ounce of sense knows it’s simply his way of getting his own back for that business with the club committee last spring. The plain fact is that the high-minded cove brandishing the sword of impartial fairness is generally the same blighter you saw nursing a grievance the week before. It’s never a question of what’s fundamentally correct, you see, but rather of whose turn it is to be correct—a decision invariably made by the fellow who happens to be holding the gavel at that particular moment.
