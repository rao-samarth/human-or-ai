My dear Percy, you simply wouldn’t believe the goings-on at Bilbury Hall. It’s well past two, and a fellow ought to be communing with the pillow, but a thirst of Saharan proportions drove me downstairs. And there, in the study, hunched under a single green-shaded lamp that gave him the distinct air of a scheming frog, was our host, old Uncle Mortimer himself. He had that silver trophy—the one he won for his prize-winning marrows—and was carefully scraping at the hallmark with a small, sharp file. For a fleeting moment, I thought the old bean had merely taken up an eccentric new hobby in late-night polishing. But the look on his face, Percy, a sort of furtive, gimlet-eyed concentration, suggested a far darker business was afoot. He was, I’m quite certain, attempting to obscure the fact that it was only silver-plated. A dashed shabby bit of work, and it quite put me off my seltzer.
