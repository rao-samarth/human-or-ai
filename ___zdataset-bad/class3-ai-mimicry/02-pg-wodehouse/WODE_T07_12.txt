I grant you, sir, that the instructions issued by yourself regarding the prize marrow were, on the face of it, models of clarity. One was to stand sentinel, and one did. The difficulty, you see, arose from a point of principle. The vegetable in question, while undeniably vast—of a size one usually associates with a small zeppelin—possessed a distinctly melancholy aspect. It seemed to cry out for a spot of cheer. To leave a fellow creature, even a cucurbit, in such a blue funk simply wasn’t an option. Consequently, employing a small set of watercolours I keep for botanical emergencies, I administered a jaunty top hat and a welcoming smile. It was a matter of simple humanity, as I saw it, though I concede your own view—expressed shortly thereafter with a startling resemblance to a kettle coming to the boil—differed rather materially from mine.
