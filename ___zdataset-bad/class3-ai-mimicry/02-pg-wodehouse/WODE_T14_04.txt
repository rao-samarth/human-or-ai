My dear Wilbert, your query regarding the grand cosmic blueprint found me wedged in a rather chintzy tea-shop, and I must confess, the performance at the adjacent table has quite swayed my thinking on the matter. A portly gentleman, who plainly fancied himself a captain of industry and a master of his own soul, was explaining to his companion—a nervous-looking specimen who resembled a recently startled rabbit—how every triumph in his life was the result of shrewd, iron-willed calculation. He was, he boomed, the sole architect of his magnificent fortune. It was precisely at this moment that a passing waiter, distracted by a small child’s ear-splitting yelp, stumbled and dispatched a teacake, heavily laden with jam and cream, on a perfect, parabolic trajectory that ended squarely on the architect’s pristine white waistcoat. One can map out one’s route with the utmost care, you see, but one seldom accounts for the intervention of a flying scone.
