It was the sight of Sidney Hemlock preening beside his new scarlet roadster that had, in a word, curdled the cream in Percival’s afternoon tea. The machine was an absolute brute, all gleaming chrome and aggressive angles, and Hemlock himself was polishing a headlamp with what looked suspiciously like a silk handkerchief; a wide, self-satisfied smirk was plastered across his face, the sort of smirk one associates with a cat that has just located the key to the dairy. “One has to admit, the fellow has a certain flair,” Barmy offered, peering over his crumpet. Percival gave a short, sharp snort, a sound not unlike an indignant terrier spotting a rival for a particularly juicy bone. “Flair? It’s the flair of a costermonger who’s had a successful day with the cabbages! And dash it all, Barmy, look who’s cooing over the leatherwork—Millicent Albright! She distinctly informed me last Tuesday that the internal combustion engine was the devil’s own handiwork.” The sheer, concentrated injustice of it all was quite enough to make a chap question the fundamental fairness of the cosmos.
