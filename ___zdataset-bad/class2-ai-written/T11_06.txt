I do feel a bit sorry for the man by the quartet. He thinks his suit is the right kind of expensive, but the cut is all wrong—too sharp, too eager. And the way he circulates, darting from one important conversation to the next, brandishing his success like a business card, it's just exhausting to watch. Some people mistake access for belonging. They see the guest list and assume they've arrived, not understanding that the real currency here isn't the balance in your bank account, but the unspoken knowledge of how to simply *be* in a room like this. It’s about which jokes to laugh at, how long to hold eye contact with the hostess, and when to pretend you don't notice the minister slipping out the side door. It's an ease you're born with, I suppose. You can't just learn it.
