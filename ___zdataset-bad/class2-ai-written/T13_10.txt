The phone’s lens was a perfect, adoring eye, and I gave it everything. I walked through the crowded plaza as if the throngs of people were parting just for me, a river of blurred faces making way for the star. My smile was practiced, my steps were confident; I was narrating my perfect day to an audience I knew was watching, hanging on every curated moment. The city noise was my soundtrack, the skyscrapers my backdrop. I felt invincible, a main character in a world that was mine to film. Then my heel caught on a loose paving stone. The world tilted violently. My designer coffee cup flew from my hand in a comical arc, splashing a hot, brown mess across my white coat, and my phone clattered onto the concrete. For a frozen second, there was only the shock. Then came the sound—not of the city, but of a few distinct, sharp laughs. The river of faces stopped being a blur and became a collection of individual eyes, all fixed on me, the girl sprawled on the ground. The heat that flooded my cheeks was more scalding than the coffee.
