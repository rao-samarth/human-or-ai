You’re speaking of this as if we can weigh two separate goods on a scale, but that isn't the shape of the problem. What you want for yourself, with her, is a valid and deeply human thing; a life guided by its own internal light. I don’t deny its pull. But the commitment we made wasn't just a personal vow—it was a public act that created a new reality for others, a reality in which we were fixtures they could depend on. It became a load-bearing wall in their lives. To now decide that your own feelings are a more fundamental truth, a higher law that invalidates this structure, is to misunderstand the nature of a promise. It isn't a feeling that can be superseded by a stronger one. It is a thing you build, and if you walk away, you are not just leaving a space; you are leaving a ruin.
