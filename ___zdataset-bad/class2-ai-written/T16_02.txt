Don’t look at my hands. You see the right thing to do, the necessary step, and you can’t understand why I’m hesitating, but this isn't an intellectual problem to be solved. This is a cold, sharp thing lodged right under my ribs, a physical presence that tells me every single part of this is wrong. It isn't the absence of valor; it’s the price of it, the feeling you must drag with you into the fire. Every instinct is screaming at me to run, to find an exit, to choose the safety of silence over the unknown consequences of speaking out. What you call strength is just the act of taking another breath when the air has been stolen from your lungs, and right now, I can barely breathe. So give me a moment before you ask me to walk through that door.
