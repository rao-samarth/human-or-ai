The air in the ballroom was thick with perfume and the self-congratulatory hum of the city’s elite. From my table near the back, I watched my boss, Mr. Harding, lean in close to Councilwoman Reyes, his voice a low rumble beneath the auctioneer’s patter. He wasn’t looking at her, but at the cocktail napkin between them, his gold pen tracing the unmistakable outline of the disputed waterfront district. A small, sharp gesture indicated a new tower where a public park was supposed to be. Reyes didn’t flinch. She simply offered a practiced, camera-ready smile as her fingers brushed against the donation check Harding had ostentatiously placed on the table. It was a handsome sum, enough to earn a round of applause when announced, but the real transaction was happening right there on a flimsy piece of paper. He slid the napkin toward her; she folded it once, decisively, and tucked it into her clutch. The handshake that followed was brief, a perfect public performance masking a foundation of private compromise.
