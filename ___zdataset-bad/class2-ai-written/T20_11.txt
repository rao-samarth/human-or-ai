So let me get this straight. You threw out my favorite coffee mug—the chipped one from my grandmother—because it didn't align with our "curated, minimalist lifestyle." You delivered a full ten-minute lecture on the evils of consumerism when I bought a new raincoat because my old one had a broken zipper. But the four identical, limited-edition sneakers that just arrived for you are somehow different? They aren't possessions; they're "investments in your personal brand." You preach about the freedom of living with less, about detaching from material things, yet your side of the closet is a monument to carefully branded, aesthetically-approved excess. It's just getting hard to keep track of which commandments apply to you and which ones are only for me.
