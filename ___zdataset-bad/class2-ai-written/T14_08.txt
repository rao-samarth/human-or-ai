The creek down past the old fence line has its own mind. It cuts a new path every spring, and you can either move your crossing or get your boots wet. Some people would fight it, I suppose. They’d haul in rocks, build a little dam, and get furious when the water eventually won, as it always does. I see it differently. When the letter arrived telling me my position was redundant, I just saw the creek carving its new bed. There was no argument to be had, no sense in piling up stones of résumés and interviews against a force that had already decided to move on. This quiet, this mud-caked solitude, wasn’t a failure. It was just where the current deposited me.
