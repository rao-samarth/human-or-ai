The rain had smeared the café window, blurring the afternoon traffic into streaks of red and white. At the next table, a man in a crisp suit stared into his untouched macchiato. His companion, a woman with a gentle face, spoke softly. “So this is it, then? The view from the top.” He didn't look up. “It’s the view I worked for,” he answered, his voice low and tired. “I spent years chasing it, certain it was the only thing that mattered.” He finally met her gaze, and the carefully constructed composure on his face seemed to crack. “Last week, my son showed me a drawing he made. It was a simple picture of our house at night, with a big yellow sun in the sky. When I told him the sun doesn't come out at night, he just said, ‘I know. That’s the sun for you, so you can see your way home.’” He didn't say anything else, just slowly turned his cup in small circles on its saucer, a tiny, repetitive gesture in the quiet hum of the cafe.
