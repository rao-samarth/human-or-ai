Walking through the downtown lunch rush feels like being swept along by a current. Thousands of people flow past, each on a trajectory that feels as fixed as a tram line, all heading toward appointments and obligations. But then, a melody drifts from an open doorway—just a few notes from a lone saxophone, sharp and sweet against the city's drone. On impulse, I turn, stepping out of the main flow of pedestrians. The music leads me down a narrow alley I've never noticed, which opens into a small, sun-drenched courtyard where a musician is playing for a handful of smiling strangers. It’s a powerful feeling, realizing the great, roaring river of the world will always have these quiet eddies, these beautiful detours, waiting for anyone who decides to listen for them and step aside.
