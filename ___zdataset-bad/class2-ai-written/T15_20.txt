A single, sharp edge protruded a half-centimeter beyond the green blotter, a glaring geometric error in an otherwise orderly grid. The sight was a splinter in his mind, making it impossible to focus on the quarterly report shimmering on his own screen. His jaw tightened. He watched the clock, watched her, waiting for her to leave for lunch. When her chair finally scraped back, his own heart began to pound a frantic, muffled rhythm against his ribs. He counted to sixty, then rose, feigning a trip to the water cooler. The detour was a magnetic pull. His hand, slick with sweat, shot out and nudged the tray back into perfect alignment. The relief was a clean, sharp gasp of air, but as he turned away, his eyes snagged on her stapler. It was angled just a few degrees too far to the left.
