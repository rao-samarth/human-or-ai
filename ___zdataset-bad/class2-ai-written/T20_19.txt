Mr. Albright is on stage now, bathed in a soft green spotlight, accepting his ‘Steward of the Planet’ award with practiced humility. It’s a masterclass. He speaks of “our solemn duty to future generations” while the room, full of people in thousand-dollar suits, nods sagely into their glasses of imported spring water. All I can picture is that news segment from last month about the chemical runoff from his new processing plant, the one that quietly poisoned a tributary just fifty miles from here. He clutches the recycled-glass trophy and talks about accountability, his voice thick with sincerity. I wonder if anyone else here remembers how his lobbyists spent millions last year to kill the very emissions regulations he’s now taking credit for championing. He gets a standing ovation.
