I corrected him, of course. He’d made a casual comment about the wine being Chilean, and I saw my opening. I didn’t just correct him; I gave a lecture, my voice rising with authority as I took the whole dinner table on a grand, unsolicited tour of Argentina’s Mendoza region, complete with a patronizing explanation of Malbec grapes. I could feel the room’s attention on me, the self-appointed expert, and I savored the weight of their quiet focus. Then my cousin, without a word, tilted the bottle toward the light. The label, in crisp, undeniable print, clearly stated ‘Valle Central, Chile.’ The silence that followed was heavier than any argument. It was the sound of my own magnificent balloon of certainty popping, leaving nothing but a hot flush creeping up my neck and the sight of my father suddenly finding his mashed potatoes intensely fascinating. My uncle didn’t even smirk; he just gave a small, quiet nod, which was somehow infinitely worse.
