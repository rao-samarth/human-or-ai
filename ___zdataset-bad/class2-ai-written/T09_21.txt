The hiss of the espresso machine behind the counter was a poor substitute for the words he couldn't find. “I know that,” he finally managed, his voice a low scrape that barely carried over the clink of a nearby spoon. “I just… I needed to see you.” Lena didn’t look up from her untouched latte. “And I needed you not to destroy the one thing I asked you to protect.” A woman at the next table shifted in her chair, pretending to be absorbed in her book, but her shoulders were rigid. He felt the heat rise in his own neck, a flush of pure, sickening shame that had nothing to do with the stranger and everything to do with the quiet, unyielding judgment in Lena’s eyes. It was a mirror, reflecting a version of himself he never wanted to be, a person who breaks promises. He opened his mouth, then closed it again. What was there left to say that wasn't just another selfish noise?
