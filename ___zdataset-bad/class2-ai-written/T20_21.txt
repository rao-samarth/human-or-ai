It’s quiet again, just the hum of the refrigerator and the soft glow from your charging station. I’m sitting here in the dark, looking at the mountain of boxes by the front door, the new ones balanced precariously on top of last week's stack. I saw your post today, the one about the 'liberation of letting go' and finding joy in 'experiences, not things.' It got thousands of likes. People in the comments praised your authenticity, your mindful approach to life. It’s quite a monument you’re building here, this tribute to de-cluttering, constructed entirely from next-day shipping. They have no idea that the 'single, cherished mug' you photographed for that article is one of a dozen you ordered last month. I just wonder, when you type out those inspiring captions on a screen you bought two weeks after the last one, do you ever glance over at this pile and feel… anything at all?
