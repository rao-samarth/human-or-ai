The only light came from the streetlamp outside, casting long shadows across the living room floor. It’s in these quiet hours that the urge for a reckoning feels most potent. There’s a part of the mind that craves a simple, symmetrical response—an eye for an eye, a hurt for a hurt. Yet, another part questions the entire equation.

The difficult part is untangling personal satisfaction from a more impersonal sense of what is right. One is a fire that consumes, the other a structure meant to contain it. The real dilemma isn't just about what should be done, but about who is clear-headed enough to draw the line between them when the injury feels so deeply personal.
