Brenda’s mandatory seminar on “Preventing Burnout” was, of course, scheduled during our only protected lunch hour. She clicked through slides filled with stock photos of people doing yoga on mountaintops, her voice radiating the zealous conviction of a recent convert. She spoke passionately about the importance of disconnecting after hours, which was a bold move considering she'd emailed the “final-final” version of this very presentation to the team at 11:30 last night. We were instructed to “honor our personal time” and “set firm boundaries,” all while a project deadline she’d arbitrarily moved up by a week loomed on everyone’s calendar. A few of us exchanged glances over our lukewarm coffees. The most valuable boundary, it seemed, would be one that kept her unsolicited wellness advice from reaching our inboxes on a Saturday.
