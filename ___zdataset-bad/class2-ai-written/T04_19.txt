Oh, spare me the wounded puppy look. The whole “us against the world” routine sounds inspiring until the world actually shows up with a bill, and suddenly you’re staring at me like I’m the designated wallet. You talk about sticking together, about having each other’s backs, which is a lovely sentiment. But I’ve noticed that when things get truly difficult, that noble idea conveniently morphs into *me* having *your* back while you find the nearest exit. This isn't about some sacred pact we made; it’s about you needing a convenient scapegoat, an anchor to drop so your own ship can sail away clean. So no, I won't be taking the fall for this. My loyalty isn't a free utility you get to exploit when your own planning fails. It turns out my spine has a self-preservation clause.
