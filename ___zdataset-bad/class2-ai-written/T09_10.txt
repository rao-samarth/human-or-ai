Walking to the post office used to be a five-minute job, something I'd do without even thinking. Now it feels like a marathon. Every familiar face I pass seems to hold a question in their eyes, even though I know they can't possibly know what I did. They just see me, same as always. But I'm not the same. I catch my reflection in the window of Miller's Hardware and for a second, I don't recognize the person staring back with that tight, pinched look. The bell on the bakery door jingles and my stomach clenches, half-expecting to see you walk out. I keep my head down, focusing on the cracks in the sidewalk, counting them like some kind of penance. This whole town, every brick and every friendly wave, feels like a stage, and I’m just waiting for the part where everyone finds out I'm the villain.
