I strode ahead of the others, the cobblestones of the old market slick with morning rain, feeling their admiration like a warm coat. For days, I’d been their guide, their font of worldly knowledge, painting myself as the seasoned globetrotter among novices. At the fruit stall, I saw my chance to truly shine. I gestured grandly toward a pile of strange, spiky fruits and launched into the broken, carefully rehearsed phrases I’d learned from a cheap guidebook. The vendor’s face remained a mask of confusion. A long, painful silence stretched out, broken only when Sarah, the quiet girl from Ohio I’d privately dismissed as naive, stepped forward. In a fluid, effortless stream of the local tongue, she bartered, laughed, and paid for the fruit. She turned and offered me a piece, her smile kind, but all I could feel were the eyes of the group on my back. The warm coat was gone, leaving me shivering and exposed in the middle of the crowded square.
