My brother-in-law, Mark, was explaining the investment portfolio he’d set up for his toddler, and my cousin Sheila just stood there, smiling and nodding. She works two jobs to keep her own kids in clean clothes, but you’d never know it from her polite, blank expression. I wanted to tell Mark to just stop, to read the room for once, but that’s not how these things work. He isn’t cruel; he’s just operating on a completely different frequency, one where summer homes and trust funds are as normal as breathing. Later, I watched Sheila quietly help my aunt clear the dishes, moving with a practiced efficiency that made Mark’s wife, fumbling with a single plate, look utterly useless. Sheila didn’t expect thanks and didn’t receive any, because her contribution was simply assumed, like gravity. It was just her place to be helpful.
