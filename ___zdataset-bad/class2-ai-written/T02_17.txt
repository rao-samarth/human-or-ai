I saw Leo across the sun-drenched plaza, holding court with a circle of strangers. It wasn't the Leo I knew from quiet Tuesday nights and shared paperbacks. This version of him was all bright teeth and booming laughter, hands gesturing wildly as he spun a tale I recognized but couldn't quite place, its edges sanded smooth and its details exaggerated for effect. He wore a confidence as easily as he wore his expensive-looking jacket, a costume I’d never seen before. The people around him were captivated, hanging on his every polished word. For a moment, I felt a strange, chilling disconnect, as if I were watching a skilled actor play a part he was born for. I stood frozen by a fountain, just another face in the crowd, wondering which performance was the lie: the boisterous man over there, or the gentle, unassuming friend I thought I had.
