The organ music swells to fill the old church, but I can’t hear the sermon over the relentless proceedings in my own head. Here, in this pew, I am both the accused and the sole witness. I present the evidence again: the casual question I was asked last week, the easy lie I told to cover a friend's mistake, and the way that lie has since unraveled another person’s reputation. In a place this small, a single wrong word doesn't just vanish; it echoes from the feed store to the post office. Every polite nod from a neighbor on Main Street feels like a cross-examination, and each time I offer a hollow greeting in return, I am delivering my own silent, repeating verdict. There is no appeal, no higher court to petition, only the damning quiet that follows me home long after the final hymn has faded.
