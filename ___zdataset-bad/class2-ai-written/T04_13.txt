The wind moves over the high field, rattling the dry thistle heads with a sound like old paper. I trace the line of lichen on the stone wall, the same one where Leo and I once mapped out our entire futures with a piece of chalk that’s long since washed away. His future, it turned out, was paved and lit and miles from here. When he visits now, a stranger in his own hometown, he speaks a different language—one of quarterly reports and new contacts, of opportunities I can't quite picture. The silences between us feel wider than the distance he’s traveled, and I find myself wondering what really held us together all those years. Was it a genuine connection, or just the simple fact that we were both facing the same horizon from the same small place? He promised it wouldn't change anything, but promises are easy to make when the road ahead is still just a dirt track.
