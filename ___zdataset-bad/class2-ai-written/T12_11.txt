The sleek black rectangle lay half-hidden under a discarded newspaper, right in the middle of the bike lane. He scooped it up just before a taxi’s tire could crush it. It was the latest model, heavy and cool in his palm, without a single scratch. As he held it, the screen lit up with a notification from “MOM: Call me! Are you okay???” followed by a frantic stream of other messages. A picture of a smiling family glowed as the lock screen wallpaper. He could feel his own phone vibrating in his pocket, a familiar low-battery warning. This device was worth more than his next two rent payments combined. A quick wipe, a visit to that sketchy shop a few blocks away, and his financial problems would just shrink. The sheer anonymity of the bustling street felt like a shield. No one had seen him. Then another message popped up: “PLEASE I have baby photos on there I’ll give a reward.” He stood frozen amidst the river of pedestrians, the traffic noise a roaring in his ears, weighing the faces on the screen against the single, depressing number in his bank account.
