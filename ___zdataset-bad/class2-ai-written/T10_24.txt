The 11 o’clock news is a masterclass, really. You have to admire the artistry. See how they framed that shot, just so? How they found the one tearful witness who validates the entire narrative, while conveniently forgetting the three others who said the opposite. They don't have to lie, not outright; that would be clumsy. They just have to be brilliant editors. They snip away the context, trim the inconvenient details, and polish the remaining fragment until it shines with a righteous, simple certainty. It’s a beautiful little story they’ve built, a neat package of outrage delivered right to your living room. And tomorrow morning, millions will have their coffee, absolutely convinced they know what happened, armed with a version of events so clean and perfect it could never have survived contact with reality.
