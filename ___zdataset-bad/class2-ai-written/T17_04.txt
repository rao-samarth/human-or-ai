He said I could take the post-hole digger. "Bring it back whenever," he told me, leaning against his fence like he had all the time in the world, so I took him at his word. I didn't know about the Henderson job, the one he'd been waiting on for months. I certainly didn't know he needed the digger back by Thursday. When he came storming into my yard Saturday morning, his face was beet red, and he started yelling about respect and how people in this town used to keep their promises. I just got my back up, you know? I told him to calm down, but he kept on, and suddenly it wasn't about the tool anymore. It was about the property line dispute our grandfathers had sixty years ago. He brought that up. And then I said what I said about his wife. I can see now how one thing led to another, but in that moment, all I saw was his anger, and all I felt was my own. We haven't spoken since, and now the whole town seems to be picking a side.
