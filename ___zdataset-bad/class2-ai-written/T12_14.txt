I’m writing this from the porch swing, watching the last of the sun catch the tops of the old oaks. I know you think I'm being sentimental, that I should just look at the numbers he put on that contract. And believe me, I do see them; I see them every time I close my eyes. They promise a life without worry, a future completely remade, but out here, all I can hear is the creek running over the stones and the wind moving through the valley. He called it 'unlocking potential,' but it feels more like breaking a promise we never realized we’d made to this place, to Dad. Is it really worth erasing all of this just so we never have to budget again? The quiet here feels more valuable than anything he offered, yet that figure on the page keeps whispering that I’m a fool for even thinking so.
