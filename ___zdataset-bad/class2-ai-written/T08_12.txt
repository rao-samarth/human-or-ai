The steady clatter of the train wheels on the track did nothing to soothe him. He stared past his own reflection in the grimy window, watching the blur of grey fields rushing by. “It has to be done,” he said, his voice low enough that only she could hear over the rhythm of the rails. “You know it does.” Across the small table, his sister Maya stopped tracing the worn pattern on the seat with a trembling finger. “That’s not your call to make,” she whispered, her eyes pleading with an intensity that pricked at his resolve. “It’s not for us.” He finally turned from the window, his expression hard. “Then who? The courts that did nothing? The world that forgot? Someone has to restore the balance.” She shook her head, a single, sharp motion. “You’re not restoring anything, you’re just breaking something else. This isn’t about what is right anymore. This is about what you *need*, and you have no right to make everyone else pay for it.”
