It's the blue coat I see first, always. Today, it was just a flash of it across the platform at Canal Street, swallowed by the crowd before I could even get a clear look. But it was enough. My heart did that familiar lurch, and I found myself pushing through people, craning my neck, completely forgetting which train I was even supposed to be on. My boss is going to be furious, but I couldn't help it. I ended up riding three stops in the wrong direction, just staring at the sea of faces, hoping for another glimpse. They say you can't find a specific person in a city this big, that it's just my mind playing tricks. But they don't understand the specific way the collar is frayed on the left side, a detail I’m sure I saw last Tuesday near the park. Every dark coat now makes my pulse jump; it's a city of ghosts and I'm hunting for just one.
