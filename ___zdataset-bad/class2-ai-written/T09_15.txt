The house is still, a silence so deep it seems to have its own weight. I keep waiting for the floorboards to creak or the refrigerator to hum, any small noise to break the spell, but nothing comes. It’s just me and this hollow space in my chest where an apology should be. I trace the rim of a water glass on the table, the condensation cold against my fingertips. The conversation plays back in my head—not as a memory, but as something happening right now, the words hanging sharp and clear in the dark kitchen. My own voice sounds foreign, needlessly cruel. I close my eyes and try to just feel the quiet of the night, but it’s no use. The wrongness of what I did has settled into my bones, a cold ache that sleep won't touch.
