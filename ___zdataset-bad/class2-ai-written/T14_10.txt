My brother Mark is explaining, for what feels like the third time, why the logistics company let him go. He gestures with his fork, talking about market forces and a bad quarter, as if his life is just a raft being tossed around on a current he can’t control. I nod sympathetically, of course, while my wife squeezes my hand under the table. She knows. We both know it’s not about the market; it’s about the choices he made, the degree he never finished, the savings he never started. People build their own ships. I decided early on I wouldn’t be a passenger; I took the unpaid internship, I worked the extra hours, I made the right connections. It’s not some grand, mysterious plan. It's a series of doors, and some people simply lack the foresight to walk through the right ones, even when they’re standing wide open. He just sees the doors slamming shut, never the moment he chose not to step through.
