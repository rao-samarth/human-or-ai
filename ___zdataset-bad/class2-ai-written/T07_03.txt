"I gave you one simple instruction, Kael." The Director’s voice was unnervingly calm, a stark contrast to the quiet hum of the air recyclers in his sterile office. He leaned back in his leather chair, the polished mahogany of his desk a vast, dark plain between them. "It wasn't an instruction; it was a violation," Kael replied, his own voice steady despite the tremor he felt in his hands. He kept them clasped behind his back. The Director’s thin smile didn't reach his eyes. "You seem to misunderstand your position. You are a component, a tool to be used for the greater stability." He gestured vaguely toward the city lights visible through the armored window. "My position," Kael said, taking a small, deliberate step forward, "is what I choose it to be. And I no longer choose to be your tool." The smile finally vanished from the Director's face, replaced by a cold, appraising stillness that was far more dangerous.
