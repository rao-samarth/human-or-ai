He only told me to watch for smoke from the west ridge, that it would mean the levy was breaking. So when I saw it, that thick plume of gray against the afternoon blue, I did what he told me to do. I opened the gates. All of them. I sent the whole herd for the high ground before the water could come, just like we’d planned. I didn't know his kid was just burning a pile of old leaves and damp wood near the ridge line. I never thought to call because he always said, "the smoke is the call, no time for phones." By the time I realized the fields were dry and the river was calm, the cattle had already trampled half his new corn and broken through the fences into the county road. Now he looks at me like I'm a vandal, not the man who followed his own instructions to the letter. He just sits on his porch, and I sit on mine, and the silence between our properties is wider and deeper than any floodwater could ever be.
