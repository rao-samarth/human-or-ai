My cousin just called me a saint, right here over the wilting salad and the birthday cake for Dad. A real, bona fide saint for turning down a weekend away to stay and manage his medication schedule. It’s a wonderful feeling, being canonized for choosing the sensible, responsible path. They all applaud my "devotion" before cutting another slice of cake, conveniently forgetting they’ll be on a plane back to their own exciting, unburdened lives in the morning. Meanwhile, I'll be here, upholding my end of a bargain I made years ago, a promise that has since become the cornerstone of my gilded cage. But yes, I’m a hero. A true paragon of family loyalty for dutifully shelving my own chance at happiness because it’s the right thing to do. Someone should really put that on a decorative pillow.
