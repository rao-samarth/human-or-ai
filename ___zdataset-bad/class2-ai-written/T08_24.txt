I know you’re probably hearing the news about the Gable property, even all the way out there. The talk at the diner this morning was practically celebratory, with people saying he finally got what was coming to him after all the families he squeezed out and the corners he cut. A part of me understands that feeling, the satisfaction of seeing the scales finally tip. But sitting there, listening to it all, I couldn't shake this unease. They call it evening the score. It feels different to me, though, something colder and wilder. When did a fire in the night become our way of balancing the books? There’s what feels fair, and then there’s what happens when people decide to make things fair on their own terms, and I’m not so sure the two are the same. It just feels like we’ve traded one kind of wrong for another, and I don't know who is supposed to feel better about that.
