Surrounded by the low hum of practiced conversation at the charity gala, it’s easy to see the whole affair as a finely-tuned machine. Each handshake, each exchanged pleasantry, feels like a pre-calculated move in a game whose rules were written long before any of us arrived. We credit our presence here to a series of deliberate choices, a climb up a ladder we built ourselves, but how much of that was simply being placed at the bottom of the right ladder from the start? A spilled glass of wine, a joke that lands unexpectedly, a sudden, genuine connection across a crowded table—these moments feel different. They are the glitches in the system, the brief, unscripted instances that make you wonder if we are merely acting out a sophisticated play or if, just occasionally, we get to write a single, surprising line of our own.
