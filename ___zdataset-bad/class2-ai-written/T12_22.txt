The air out here is supposed to be cleaner, but you can practically smell the desperation wafting off the Henderson place. Now that old man Henderson is finally fertilizer, the long-lost relatives have materialized like mushrooms after a rain, all brimming with manufactured grief. They wander his fields, heads bowed in "solemn reflection," which looks suspiciously like pacing property lines. You hear them muttering about "honoring his legacy" while their eyes calculate acreage and proximity to the new highway interchange. It’s amazing, really. A lifetime of never calling, never visiting, all wiped away by the glorious, redemptive power of a potential bidding war. They say you learn a person's true character in times of hardship; I think a "For Sale" sign on a decent plot of land does the job far more efficiently.
