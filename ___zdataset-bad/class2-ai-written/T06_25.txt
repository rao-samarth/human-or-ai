I’m sitting at this little café in Lisbon, the one with the blue tiles I sent you a picture of, and I probably shouldn't have checked my phone. I saw the photos from the lake house this weekend. It looked perfect. I know I’m the one halfway across the world on this big trip, but seeing you all there, laughing in the sunshine, it just hit me in a strange way. A cold knot formed in my stomach as I zoomed in on the faces, wondering what inside jokes I was missing, wondering if you even noticed I was gone. Suddenly, I felt convinced that my place in that group was just on loan, easily and happily filled the moment I stepped away. This beautiful city suddenly feels vast and lonely.
