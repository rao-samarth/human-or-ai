The low hum of the drone is the only thing that spoils the afternoon quiet out here. From my porch, I can see her down by the creek, arranging river stones into a little tower for her audience. She’s talking to her phone, propped up on a tripod, about disconnecting from the noise and finding your true, wild self in nature. It’s a lovely sentiment, really. It’s just slightly undermined by the two-person camera crew capturing her "solitude" from another angle, and the portable generator chugging away behind a cluster of birch trees to power her lighting rig. She’ll upload this perfectly curated moment of raw, unplugged authenticity later tonight, probably adding a filter and a trending audio clip, all from the comfort of her rental cabin with the high-speed satellite internet. I wonder if her followers realize that finding your wild self is now a fully produced, multi-cam event.
