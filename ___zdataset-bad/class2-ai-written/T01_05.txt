My nephew Leo is holding court at the head of the patio table, recounting a story about a lost library book. His biggest drama of the week. They hang on his every word, laughing at the punchline I missed while glancing at my phone. Meanwhile, a seven-figure deal is teetering on a single email, a crisis I'm trying to discreetly manage under the tablecloth's floral pattern. My sister shoots me a look, the one that says I’m not present, that I’m choosing work over this moment. She doesn't get that my very presence here, this house, the catered food they're all enjoying, is funded by this exact brand of impoliteness. It's a small price, I tell myself, for securing their comfort. They enjoy the shade from a tree they don't realize I had to bleed to plant.
