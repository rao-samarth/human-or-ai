Anna’s grin faltered. She set her fork down, the clink against the ceramic plate sounding unnaturally loud. "What are you talking about? I thought you'd be happy for me." He finally looked up, and the bitterness in his expression made her stomach clench. "Happy? Why wouldn't I be? It's just so easy for you, isn't it? Everything you touch, every person you meet. You just glide through." He gestured vaguely at her, at the room, his hand trembling slightly. A woman at a nearby table paused her conversation to stare. Anna felt a flush of heat crawl up her neck, a mix of shame and a rising, defensive anger. This wasn't support; it was a verdict.
