The champagne flute felt cold and heavy in my hand, a stark contrast to the boiling heat in my veins as I watched him on the dais. He was bathed in golden light, accepting an award for "community leadership" while the applause thundered, a thousand hands clapping for a man who had shattered my world and walked away without a scratch. They saw a philanthropist; I saw the architect of my ruin. A quiet, clinical part of my mind argued that a proper system would eventually catch up to him, that his downfall would be a balanced and appropriate outcome. But the rest of me, the screaming, wounded part, wanted something else entirely. It didn’t want the scales to be balanced; it wanted them to be broken, to be smashed under the weight of his own suffering. I wanted him to feel what I felt, and the polite, deafening applause echoing in this grand hall felt like the cruelest mockery of that burning need.
