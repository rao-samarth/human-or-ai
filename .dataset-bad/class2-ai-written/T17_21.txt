The new fence posts, raw and splintered against the green hills, had marked more than just the supposed property line; they had drawn a stark boundary between two old friends. It had all begun with a single, hasty word about a survey marker, a comment that twisted in the telling until it sounded like an accusation of theft. For weeks, the only communication was the sharp sound of hammers and the strained silence that followed. But this morning, a different sound carried on the breeze. From his kitchen window, Arthur saw Elias out by the fence line, not with a hammer, but with a crowbar, methodically prying the first post from the damp earth. He wasn't looking over, not yet, but the work itself was an apology, a quiet invitation to find the real line together. A fragile bridge was being built where a wall had stood just yesterday.
