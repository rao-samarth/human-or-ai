The Chancellor finished his speech, his final, booming pronouncement on unity and order echoing for a moment in the gilded hall. A wave of applause was meant to follow, the expected punctuation to his display of command. But it did not come. Instead, a profound silence settled over the assembly, a collective withholding that was more damning than any shout of dissent. In that vacuum, it became a stark demonstration that authority, for all its grand architecture and uniformed enforcers, ultimately rests on a fragile agreement—the shared performance of submission. The refusal to participate, to offer even the simplest gesture of affirmation, revealed the entire structure as hollow. The empty air itself became a declaration, a quiet and spreading realization that the most absolute command is meaningless without the individual, internal decision to obey.
