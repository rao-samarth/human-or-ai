The “Final Boarding” call blared over the intercom, and my pulse hammered against my ribs. I was trapped. Stuck behind a man meticulously unpacking a duffel bag onto the security conveyor belt as if he had all the time in the world. He wore a faded shirt proclaiming “Live Simply,” a motto apparently at odds with the sheer volume of his possessions. Out came three laptops, a tangle of chargers that could power a small village, and an entire collection of travel-sized toiletries, each one a miniature plastic monument to convenience. He lectured the weary agent about corporate greed and the disposable nature of modern society, all while fumbling to separate his dozen tiny bottles of organic, cruelty-free goo into yet another plastic bag. My own single carry-on felt weightless by comparison. I just needed to get past this sermon on the mount to make my flight.
