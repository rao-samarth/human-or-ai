The only sound was the hum of the old clock on the mantelpiece, each second dropping into the quiet room like a stone. I walked through it all night, Ben, trying to make your version of events fit, trying to find a way it could be true. He just stared at his hands, finally defeated. It wasn’t the lie itself that hollowed me out; I’ve forgiven lies before. It was the quiet assumption hiding behind it. The cold calculation that I would stand with you, no questions asked, because that’s just what I do. You didn't even think to ask for my help, because in your mind, you already had it. You saw my trust not as a gift we had built together over years, but as a tool you could simply pick up and use when things got difficult. The space between us on the sofa, once a comfortable habit, now felt like a chasm.
