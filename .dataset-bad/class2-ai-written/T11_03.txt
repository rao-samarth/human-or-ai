It’s so peaceful watching the lights in the village come on from up here. Father always said it was our duty to share the estate’s beauty, and we do. The villagers use the lower path through the woods when they come to help with the gardens or the fete. My cousin from the city asked why they don't just use the main drive, but she doesn't understand how things work out here. The lower path is a shortcut for them, leading right from their cottages, and it’s what they’ve always done; it’s practical. They’re not much for grand entrances anyway, being straightforward people who are content with the familiar. It’s an arrangement that has worked for generations, a quiet understanding that keeps everything running smoothly for everyone involved. Some things just don't need to be questioned or changed.
