The taxi door slammed shut, a final punctuation mark he couldn't have intended but which felt brutally absolute all the same. Through the rain-streaked window, I saw his mouth move one last time, his words swallowed by the shriek of a distant siren and the relentless hiss of tires on wet asphalt. But I thought I heard enough. The shape of the words, the frustrated set of his jaw—it seemed so clear. I turned my face forward, watching the neon signs of the city blur into long, weeping streaks of color. He could have chosen any moment, but he chose a crowded street corner in a downpour. My phone buzzed in my purse, a frantic, desperate vibration I refused to answer. I let the silence in the cab grow until it was as loud as the storm outside, a vast chasm opening between us, born from a handful of sounds I now wished the city noise had stolen completely.
