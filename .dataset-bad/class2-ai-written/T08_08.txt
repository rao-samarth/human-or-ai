The swallows are gone for the year, Anna. You asked in your last letter if I felt any better now that it’s all ‘officially’ over, and the honest answer is no. They applied their formulas, a fine was paid, and the ledger was declared balanced. But out here, where the only sound is the wind in the pines, that balance feels like a fiction. It was a neat, tidy solution for a world that isn't neat or tidy at all. A part of me still wants to see him lose something he can’t just buy back, something that leaves a mark. Is that a call for genuine fairness, or is it just a darker echo of what he did to us? I don’t know who gets to make that distinction, the judge with his gavel or the person left standing in the wreckage, but I know the official answer isn't enough. It doesn't even come close.
