From his perch on a small, grassy knoll, Alistair guided the small group through a meditation on releasing material desire, his voice a calm and steady current in the warm afternoon air. He spoke of the purity of a life unburdened by possessions. A soft breeze stirred the wildflowers around them, and for a moment, the scene was a perfect picture of the rustic simplicity he so often preached about. Then, a faint, mechanical whine grew from beyond the treeline, a sound entirely out of place in this pastoral quiet. An octocopter drone, branded with the cheerful logo of a global retail giant, zipped overhead on its way to a neighboring farm. Alistair’s smooth monologue faltered, his shoulders tensing as he tracked the machine's flight. He let out a barely audible sigh of frustration, not because it disturbed the peace, but because he suddenly remembered he’d forgotten to add artisanal coffee pods to his own order yesterday.
