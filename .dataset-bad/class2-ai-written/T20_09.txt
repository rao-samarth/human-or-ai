"It's just magnificent, Clara," Arthur boomed, his voice echoing slightly in the minimalist gallery space as he gestured with a champagne flute at the sprawling, chaotic canvas he had just purchased. "The way you critique the callousness of consumer culture, the sheer emptiness of it all. It’s a vital message for our times." He took a long sip, the reflection of the gallery lights glittering on his absurdly expensive watch. I just smiled, a tight, thin thing. "I'm glad you think so, Arthur," I said, my own voice barely a whisper against the polite murmur of the crowd. "Especially since the red pigment is made from the shredded marketing materials of the last three start-ups your firm acquired and then dismantled for parts. Their founders said you delivered the news over a catered lunch. I thought it was important to capture that specific shade of vital." Arthur’s smile faltered, the flute frozen halfway to his lips as the color drained from his face.
