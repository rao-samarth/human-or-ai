The hiss of the espresso machine usually soothed me, but today it just sounded like a slow leak. When the bell above the door jangled, I saw Mark shuffle in, looking a decade older than he had last spring. My throat went tight. The memory of my own confident voice echoed in my head, casual and certain over beers on his deck: “It’s a guaranteed return, man. You can’t lose.” Now his contracting business was gone, and there he was, ordering a plain black coffee he was probably counting out quarters to afford. Every instinct screamed at me to get up, to walk over, to say… what? An apology felt like an insult, a flimsy bandage for a wound I’d inflicted. So I just sat there, half-hidden by my laptop, watching him. He paid, his shoulders slumped in that worn-out flannel shirt, and never once looked in my direction. He pushed the door open, and the bell’s cheerful little sound was the most damning thing I had ever heard.
