Uncle Mark just brought it up again, of course, loud enough for half the table to hear. That casual, off-hand comment about my "little venture" and how it’s a shame it didn't work out. I feel the familiar heat rise in my cheeks, the tightening in my chest. My first instinct is to fight back, to lay out the whole ugly truth of it—the dishonest partner, the impossible numbers, the conscious choice I made to walk away before it ruined people. But then I look around at the carefully constructed peace of this dinner, the polite smiles and the clinking of wine glasses. What would it accomplish? Explaining would just sound like making excuses, a desperate attempt to rewrite a story they've already finished in their minds. So I just nod and take a sip of water, letting the false narrative hang in the air between us. It's a bitter pill to swallow, this quiet preservation of a fragile peace, allowing their simplified version to become the accepted one.
