The evening air here is different, heavy with the scent of damp earth and clover from the fields that now stretch all the way to Miller’s Creek. People in the village whisper that I was ruthless, that I leveraged an old man’s misfortune for a few more acres. They don't understand what it takes to build something that lasts, something truly yours. They see a signature on a deed; I see a legacy secured, potential that was going to waste. Of course, the invitations to neighborhood barbecues have stopped, and cars seem to speed up when they pass my lane. But as I sit on this porch, watching the last light bleed from the sky over land that is finally, wholly mine, the silence doesn't feel like loneliness. It feels like the price of admission, a small and necessary cost for a view like this.
