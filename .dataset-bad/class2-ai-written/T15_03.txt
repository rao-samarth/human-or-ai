She stirred her latte, the small clinking sound seeming to pull her back from a great distance. "For months, the entire world had shrunk to the size of my desk, to one single, looping question," she said, her voice quiet but clear over the cafe's low hum. "Every conversation was a potential clue, every stranger on the street a possible piece of a puzzle that only I could see. I wasn't really steering anymore; I was just following the threads wherever they led, convinced they were forming a coherent picture. But then, a few days ago, I just… looked up. Really looked up. I saw the sunlight hitting the dust motes in my apartment, I heard the neighbors laughing through the wall, and it was like a fever broke. The puzzle is still there, I suppose, but it's not the whole world anymore. It's just a small thing on my desk again, and I can finally choose to walk away from it for a while."
