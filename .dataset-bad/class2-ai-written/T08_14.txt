You keep asking what gives me the right, as if there’s some universal ledger where these things are recorded and approved. There isn’t. There’s only what happens and what comes after. Don't confuse what I'm doing with some petty need to get even; that’s a child’s game of trading blows on the playground. This is a correction. It’s an equation that was left unbalanced, and the people who were supposed to solve it just shrugged and walked away. They called it a tragedy and filed it under ‘unresolved.’ But I saw the numbers. I know what was taken. Someone has to make it add up in the end. It’s not about feeling good or getting closure. It’s about ensuring the final sum is the right one, and if the designated accountants won’t do the math, then a person has to pick up the pencil themselves.
