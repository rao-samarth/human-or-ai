The old house groans in its sleep, and I lie here listening, tracing the lines of my life back in the dark. It’s funny how you can convince yourself you’re the architect of it all. I chose this job, I ended that relationship, I bought this very house. Each decision felt so deliberate at the time, so monumental. But now, in the quiet, the threads feel different. Was it a choice, or just the inevitable result of a random conversation at a party five years ago, or the bus I happened to miss in college? It feels less like a series of conscious moves and more like being pushed along by a current, occasionally getting to steer a few inches to the left or right. I wonder if I’m just mistaking the shape of the riverbed for a path I carved myself.
