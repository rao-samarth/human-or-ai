The lighting in the grand dining room was soft, but Richard’s smile was anything but. He leaned across the starched white tablecloth, his voice a low, confidential murmur meant only for her. “That’s the oyster fork, not the dessert fork. An easy mistake if you’re not used to this sort of thing.” Maya’s hand froze halfway to the tiny chocolate torte. She slowly placed the fork down, its silver tines making a faint clink against the porcelain. She met his gaze, her own expression unreadable. “Thank you, Richard. It's so helpful to have a guide. Tell me, what other landmines are there? Does the way I hold my wine glass betray my origins? Is my accent too flat for these high ceilings? I’m just trying to understand the full curriculum of what makes a person acceptable here, because it clearly has very little to do with the check I wrote to get in.” His patronizing smile faltered, replaced by a flicker of genuine surprise before hardening into disapproval.
