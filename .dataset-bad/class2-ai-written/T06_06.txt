Everyone’s gathered around the grill, laughing about something my aunt said, and the whole backyard smells like charcoal and fresh-cut grass. I'm trying to look genuinely happy for my cousin, Mark, as he shows pictures of his new house on his phone—the one with the big wraparound porch we all knew he was looking at. I even managed a "Wow, that's incredible," but the words felt like they belonged to someone else. It’s not that I don’t want him to have it; it’s just that a hot, tight feeling is coiling in my stomach as I picture my own cramped apartment and the rent check I just wrote. He makes it all look so effortless, and I can't shake the thought that things must just fall into place for people like him, while I'm stuck running in place. My uncle offers me another burger, and I just shake my head, suddenly having lost my appetite completely.
