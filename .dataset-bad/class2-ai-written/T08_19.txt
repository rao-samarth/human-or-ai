At the bar association dinner, Judge Alistair surveyed the room, the clinking of glasses a soft counterpoint to his thoughts. A young prosecutor, eager and full of fire, had approached him earlier, speaking of 'making them pay' for a particularly heinous crime. Alistair remembered that same heat in himself, years ago. But he had learned a difficult lesson: the system isn't designed for emotional retribution. It's meant to be a scale, not a sword. The desire to inflict pain equivalent to what was suffered is a deeply human impulse, a powerful and understandable one, but it is not the law's function. The law seeks balance, a restoration of order, however imperfectly. It must be cold and procedural by necessity, because the moment it becomes personal, driven by grief or rage, it ceases to be an instrument of fairness and becomes something else entirely—a weapon wielded by the most powerful or the most wounded.
