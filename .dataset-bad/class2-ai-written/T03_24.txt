For six months, my signature was on every one of those progress reports, each one a little more fictional than the last. You can call it a team decision or a necessary adjustment to secure the next round of funding, but my name was on it, and the work was a lie. Eventually, that’s all you really have in this industry—what your word is worth. The investors and the junior staff had to know the numbers were fabricated, and they had to hear it from me. If being unemployable in this city is the price for that, then fine. I accept the consequences. Some things just aren't for sale.
