The smell of grilled hot dogs and freshly cut grass should be comforting, the very essence of a Founder's Day celebration, but today it just sticks in my throat. Across the crowded lawn, I see Mark standing by the lemonade stand, his shoulders slumped in that specific way they get when a big order falls through. And I know the phone call I made was the reason, that single, carefully worded 'warning' I gave the new supplier out of some pathetic, fleeting sense of rivalry. Every instinct screams to just walk over there, to face the quiet disappointment in his eyes and own what I did. Yet my feet feel like they're sinking into the soft earth. Turning away, grabbing a plate of potato salad and just disappearing into the cheerful crowd, feels so much easier. He hasn't looked up yet. I have a second, maybe two, to decide which person I’m going to be.
