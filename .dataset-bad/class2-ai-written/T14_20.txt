The gallery was quiet, the only sounds the soft shuffle of shoes on polished concrete and a low voice from a couple standing before a vast, explosive canvas of color. “I used to think that way,” the woman was saying, tracing a line in the air with her finger, “that it was all just a current pulling you along, and your job was just to not drown. But I don't believe that anymore. I think we’re more like navigators on a huge, uncharted river. The river is real, sure, and some parts are rougher than others. We don't get to pick the river. But we can steer. We can choose to paddle toward that sunlit bank, or rest in a calm eddy, or just point our little boat in a direction that feels right, even if we don't know exactly where it leads. The small adjustments are everything.”
