The rookie city worker, Leo, had one simple job: repaint the crosswalk at Elm and Fourth. But the paint sprayer, a relic from a forgotten decade, had other ideas. It coughed and sputtered, laying down a thick, wobbly line that veered sharply left before correcting into a series of drunken zigzags. A crowd of pedestrians gathered on the curb, their collective expressions a mix of pity and disbelief. An elderly woman with a tiny dog pointed, asking her companion if this was some form of modern art installation. A cyclist, trying to navigate the mess, swerved dramatically and nearly collided with a pretzel vendor, who shouted something unflattering about Leo's ancestry. From his driver's seat, a taxi driver simply laid his head on the horn, a long, mournful blast that seemed to be the only rational response to the sudden, pointless breakdown of civic order. Leo, meanwhile, just stared at the chaotic white trail, wondering if it was too late to go back to culinary school.
