He was important, he was late, and the slow, meandering herd was an obstacle to be overcome, not a collection of people. Then the uneven paving stone, a sudden lurch, and the world became a chaotic sprawl of white paper and skittering pens across the grimy pavement. A hot flush of shame crawled up his neck as he heard a faint, muffled laugh from somewhere in the crowd. As he scrambled to his knees, a hand entered his field of vision, its knuckles smudged with dirt.
