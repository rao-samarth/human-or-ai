The constant, hypnotic rumble of the dryers almost lulled me to sleep, but I couldn’t help but catch fragments from the two women folding sheets nearby. They were talking about someone named Jenna who, apparently, just up and quit her corporate job to go work on a farm. “It was bound to happen,” one of them said with a shrug, “she was miserable.” The other disagreed, “That takes real guts, though. To actually choose something that different.” I watched my own socks tumble over and over behind the glass, a chaotic dance dictated entirely by the machine's spin. It’s a funny thing to think about. Are we like that? Just tumbling through a life that was set in motion for us, or are we the ones who decide to stop the machine and pull everything out? It makes you wonder if we’re the ones steering, or if we’re just gripping the wheel so tight that we convince ourselves the turns were our idea all along.
