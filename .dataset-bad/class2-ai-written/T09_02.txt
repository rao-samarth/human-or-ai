The traffic light bleeds red onto the wet pavement, and a thousand anonymous faces stream past under the flickering neon signs of cafes and pharmacies. They're all going somewhere, caught up in their own currents. But I don't really see them. My mind is stuck on a single, repeating loop: the moment the words left my mouth, casual and careless, followed by the immediate, sickening lurch in my stomach. I can still perfectly picture the way his expression collapsed, that brief flash of disbelief before the hurt settled in. It was a trust I shattered just for the sake of a story, an easy laugh that cost everything. Now, that instant is a hot, heavy stone lodged right under my ribs, a constant pressure reminding me of what I broke. I’d give anything to rewind just thirty seconds, to swallow those words before they ever found the air.
