Standing on the sun-drenched cobblestones of the capital's main square, their guide, Anya, gestured with a practiced sweep of her arm. She told them of the benevolent duke who commissioned the glorious fountain, omitting the crippling taxes he levied to fund it. She spoke of the square as a center of joyous celebration for five hundred years, carefully sidestepping the three decades it served as a stage for political show trials. Every fact she offered was technically correct, a polished stone carefully selected from the rubble of a far more complicated history. Her audience, tired from their bus ride and eager for a simple narrative, absorbed it gratefully. Only one woman, looking at the grim-faced statues ringing the plaza, felt a momentary dissonance—a story too smooth to be entirely whole. Anya saw the look but moved the group along toward the souvenir shops, her voice a warm and reassuring instrument leading them away from uncomfortable questions.
