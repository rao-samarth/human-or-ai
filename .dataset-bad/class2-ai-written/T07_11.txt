My grandfather cleared his throat, a sound that had silenced arguments for fifty years, and declared that of course, his first great-grandchild would be christened at St. Jude’s, just as everyone in the family had been. He said it not as a suggestion, but as an announcement of an immutable fact, a law of their shared history. He smiled, satisfied, looking around the dinner table for the expected chorus of agreement. But instead of nods, there was a quiet that felt heavier than dissent. My cousin, the expectant mother, simply continued buttering her roll, a small, deliberate motion. Her husband looked at his plate. No one spoke a word against the patriarch, yet the refusal was absolute, hanging in the air like smoke. It was a fascinating moment, a realization that authority isn't a force projected outward, but a vacuum that requires others to fill it with their consent. When that consent is silently, collectively withdrawn, the command simply evaporates, leaving only an old man speaking to himself.
