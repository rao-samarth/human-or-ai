From this park bench, the whole city puts on its little show. You see the couple over there, staging their hundredth candid laugh for a photo that will scream “effortless love” to their followers; they’ll be bickering over the filter choice before the latte even gets cold. Then there’s Mr. Big Shot in the bespoke suit, practically screaming into his AirPods about synergy and deliverables. You just know his entire net worth is tied up in a leased car and an apartment he can’t really afford, but the performance of success is everything, isn't it? And don't forget the brunch crew, their shrieking laughter echoing off the pavement. It's a carefully choreographed symphony of friendship, where every punchline is rehearsed and every smile is a strategic move in their quiet, relentless social war. Everyone plays their part so well. It's a matinee performance every day, and from here, you get a front-row seat to the beautiful, exhausting fraud of it all.
