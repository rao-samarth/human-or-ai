The bus glided through the dark, its tires hissing on the wet highway. Rain traced erratic paths down the window, distorting the few distant lights into hazy smears of color. I rested my head against the cool glass, feeling the subtle vibration of the engine as it carried me toward a city I’d never seen, a life I hadn't truly planned. Each turn of the wheel was a decision made by someone else, a path charted on a map I couldn’t read from here. I had packed the bag, I had bought the ticket, yes. But those actions felt less like choices and more like falling into the current of a river that had already picked its course long before I ever stepped in. I was just a passenger, watching the landscape of a life I didn't steer blur past my window.
