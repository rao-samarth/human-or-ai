You have to understand, it was supposed to be a joke. Everyone was laughing, the music was playing for their anniversary, and Uncle Mark was guarding the potato salad like it was a state secret. I just walked by and said, “Still using the secret ingredient, huh? Mayonnaise?” He didn’t laugh. His face went tight, and he announced to half the patio that I was mocking his wife’s cooking after she’d spent all day preparing for us. It happened so fast. Suddenly, he was shouting about my generation’s lack of respect, and I felt my own temper flare. I shot back something about how at least my parents didn't need a loan from their in-laws to stay afloat. The silence that followed was worse than the yelling. Now my mother isn’t speaking to her sister, and my cousin won’t even look at me. It began and ended right there, over a bowl of potatoes I never even tried.
