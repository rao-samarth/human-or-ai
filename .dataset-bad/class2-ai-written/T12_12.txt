The glossy brochure from the development company sat squarely in the center of Arthur’s desk, its vibrant images of ‘Lakeside Estates’ a stark contrast to the view of the actual meadow from his window. He’d told himself it was just a preliminary meeting, a simple courtesy extended to a potential investor in their quiet town. But the offer wasn’t for the town; it was for him. A quiet, untraceable contribution to his reelection campaign and a guaranteed director position for his son-in-law at the new regional office. Zoning regulations, environmental impact studies, the vocal opposition from half the community—these were just bureaucratic hurdles, he began to reason. Obstacles that a forward-thinking man could navigate for what was, in the long run, progress. The alternative was another decade of watching Main Street slowly fade, wasn't it? His fingers traced the edge of the brochure. A little push in the right direction was hardly a crime; it was simply good business.
