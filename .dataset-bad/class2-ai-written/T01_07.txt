I don’t understand why you’re still wringing your hands over this. Look around. This entire floor wasn't going to materialize out of goodwill and fair play; people don't just hand you things because you deserve them. You wanted to wait for the perfect, clean opportunity, but those don't exist, not for people like us. Someone had to make a decision, a real one, and I made it. Yes, lines were crossed—fine. But they were lines drawn by the very people who have always kept the door shut on us. I simply pushed the door open a little wider than they were comfortable with. Now we're on the inside, and you’re acting like I burned the whole building down. It’s done. We won. Stop looking at me like I stole something and start acting like you belong here.
