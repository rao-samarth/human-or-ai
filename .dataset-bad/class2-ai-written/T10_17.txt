Mr. Henderson droned on under the fluorescent hum of the village hall lights, his voice as smooth and bland as the weak tea served earlier. He spoke of “optimizing community assets,” a truly magnificent phrase for selling the old cricket pitch to a logistics company. He even had a chart—a beautiful, glossy thing with a soaring green arrow that proved, apparently, how this decision would lead to “unprecedented local prosperity.” It was a masterclass, really. He never mentioned the fifty lorries a day that would thunder past the primary school or the fact that his brother-in-law just happened to be a major shareholder in the purchasing firm. No, he just kept pointing at his pretty green arrow, and the assembled parishioners nodded placidly. It’s amazing what people will swallow, as long as you wrap the poison in a comforting narrative and give them a simple, brightly coloured graph to look at.
