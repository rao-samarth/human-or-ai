The moving truck, wedged immovably between two ancient stone walls, had become the village's primary afternoon entertainment. Arthur, the new homeowner, stood by with his arms crossed, watching the driver argue with a satellite navigation system that was clearly offline. His dream of a peaceful rural life was currently stalled on a lane barely wide enough for a wheelbarrow. From the other direction, a farmer on a surprisingly nimble tractor approached, a look of profound patience on his face that suggested this was not his first rescue mission. Just as negotiations began for a tow, one of the movers, attempting to lighten the load, dropped a large box marked 'PRIORITY.' It burst open not with the expected crash of crockery, but with the silent, accusing bounce of two dozen rubber chickens spilling across the cobblestones. The farmer simply raised an eyebrow. The driver stopped yelling at his phone. Arthur just started to laugh, a helpless, wheezing sound that echoed down the quiet lane.
