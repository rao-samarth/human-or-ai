I was halfway through my coffee and fully committed to ignoring the world when the guy at the next table raised his voice. He wasn't yelling, just using that low, cutting tone that’s somehow worse, directed at the young woman sitting across from him. My whole body went on alert. Every instinct screamed at me to put my headphones back in, stare harder at my laptop, and pretend I was in a bubble. It’s not my business. Don’t make a scene. Someone else will step in. But nobody did. The silence from the other tables was deafening, a thick blanket of collective avoidance. Then he called her pathetic, just like that, flat and cold. My legs felt like they were filled with concrete and my heart was doing a frantic drum solo against my ribs, but I was already standing up before my brain fully caught up. I didn't have a plan, not really. I just knew I couldn't be one of the people who heard that and did nothing.
