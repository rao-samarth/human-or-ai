The air on the penthouse terrace was thick with the scent of expensive perfume and victory. Alex felt a genuine smile spread across his face as another partner clapped him on the shoulder, the city lights sprawling below them like a conquered map. He had done it; the deal was closed, his name was on everyone’s lips. He raised his champagne flute for a sip, but a uniformed server stepped forward to top it off. Alex froze. It was Mark, from the other company’s accounting department. The one with the photos of his kids taped to his monitor, the one Alex had personally walked to the door three weeks ago. Mark’s movements were efficient, his expression professionally blank, but for a split second their eyes met. There was no anger there, just a hollowed-out stillness that was far worse. The server moved on to the next guest, but the celebratory noise around Alex had receded to a dull roar. The champagne in his hand felt impossibly heavy, and the view from the top suddenly looked a lot like a long way to fall.
