The crickets have started their nightly chorus, a sound that once brought a sense of peace but now feels like a thousand tiny accusations. I stand on the back porch, the old wood cool beneath my bare feet, and watch the last sliver of sun dip below the rolling hills. The sky bleeds orange and purple, a beautiful, bruised apology—but it’s not for me. Every rustle in the dry corn stalks sounds like his voice, replaying the words I said, the lie that slipped out so easily and now feels like a stone lodged deep in my gut. I told myself it was for the best, a small kindness to spare him the truth. But that was a lie, too. It was for me. It was easier. And now this quiet, this vast and empty landscape that I once loved, feels like a cage, its silence amplifying the ugly, screaming thing inside my own head.
