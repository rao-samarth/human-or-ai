The bus wouldn't be here for another hour, and I’d just finished explaining to Maya the profound importance of economic dignity. We weren't just tourists, I’d argued, but temporary guests responsible for supporting, not exploiting, the communities we visited. It felt good to say. Right on cue, a boy no older than ten offered us two bottles of water from a grimy cooler. He named a price that was, I knew with absolute certainty, double the going rate. Every principle I'd just championed screamed at me to simply pay it. What was an extra dollar in the grand scheme? A quiet, dignified exchange. And yet, a more stubborn, primal instinct took over: the burning indignation of being played for a fool. My mouth opened, and a practiced, dismissive laugh came out as I countered with a lower offer. Maya’s silence beside me was suddenly very loud, a perfect mirror to the eloquent speech on ethical travel I’d given not five minutes before.
