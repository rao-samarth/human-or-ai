The corner cubicle had been cleared out before lunch. All that remained of Leo was a faint coffee ring on the desk and the ghost of his citrusy aftershave. We all just went on with our work, the clicks of our keyboards filling the space where his easy laugh used to be. I kept thinking about the stories he’d told us over lukewarm coffee—the prestigious university, the summer spent backpacking through Europe, the confident way he'd explain complex data. It had all been an elaborate construction, a carefully maintained performance that had finally collapsed. No one spoke about it directly, but the silence was heavy with our collective reassessment of the last two years. We hadn't worked with Leo; we'd worked with a character he invented. Now that the actor was gone, I just felt a profound emptiness, wondering who he was when he went home and took off the costume.
