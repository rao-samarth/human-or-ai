The woman at the next table just laughed, a loud, uninhibited sound, and for a second, I thought it was me. The version of me you knew, anyway. I spent two years perfecting that role: the girl who was always game for anything, who never got tired of the crowds or the noise, whose smile never faltered. It was all an elaborate costume. Underneath it, I was just counting the minutes until I could be home, quiet and alone, with a book instead of a hundred shouting strangers. The strangest part is that now, without you to perform for, the costume feels fused to my skin. I catch myself using that laugh, putting on that smile for the barista, and I don't know how to undo it or what you would even think of the person I buried so long ago. Maybe you wouldn’t have liked her at all.
