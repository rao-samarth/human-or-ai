No, it wasn't about the Henderson account, not really. That was just the venue for it, the place it finally happened. For months, I watched him. I saw the way the directors would stop by his desk and not mine, the way his name came up in meetings for new initiatives. It was effortless for him, or it seemed to be, and every small success he had felt like a personal failure of my own. My reports started to feel dull, my ideas secondhand. When I saw his draft for the proposal—so clean, so confident—something twisted inside me. It wasn't a grand, calculated scheme. It was a five-minute impulse to change a few key numbers and corrupt the file, a desperate and pathetic attempt to make him stumble, just once. I just wanted him to feel that hot, sinking shame I felt every single day when I saw him succeeding where I was stagnant.
