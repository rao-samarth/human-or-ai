Kevin from Accounts Payable, bless his cotton socks, offered his meticulously researched cost-saving initiative to a room of dead-eyed silence. You could hear the hum of the projector. A few people nodded slowly, the way you do when you’re trying to look thoughtful while planning your lunch order. The idea vanished into the corporate ether. Then, twenty minutes later, Tristan—whose only qualification is being the CEO’s nephew and owning a truly offensive number of boat shoes—basically repeated Kevin’s point, but with more hand gestures and the word “synergy.” Suddenly, it was genius. Groundbreaking. A paradigm shift. People were grabbing for their notepads. It’s just amazing how a brilliant concept can only be heard once it’s been translated into the native tongue of someone who has never had to worry about a credit score.
