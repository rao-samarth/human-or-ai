“You can’t just walk away from this.” Mark’s voice was a low growl, barely audible over the clatter of plates from the restaurant kitchen, but it stopped me cold. I turned back, my hand still on the door. Half the diners were now openly staring, their forks paused mid-air. “There’s nothing left to say,” I replied, trying to keep my own voice steady, hoping it wouldn’t betray the tremor in my hands. He stood up, knocking his chair back a step. “There’s everything to say. You think you can just drop that bomb on me and leave? In front of all these people?” His gesture took in the entire room, the curious faces, the uncomfortable silence that had fallen. For a split second, I wanted to run, to disappear into the night and never look back. Instead, I let go of the door, faced him fully, and took a deep breath. My next words would change everything, and the fear was a physical weight in my chest, but the silence had to be broken.
