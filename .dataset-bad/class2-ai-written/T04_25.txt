There's Maya, laughing at something Henderson just said. It must have been hilarious, judging by the way she’s leaning in, her hand resting so casually on his bespoke suit sleeve. It’s a masterclass in opportunism, really. Just last week, she was the one buying me consolatory drinks, calling Henderson a soulless corporate drone after he'd shown me the door. She swore it was an injustice, that our "team" was sacrosanct and she couldn't imagine working there without me. Now, she's probably pitching him my exact project, just with a new, improved author on the title slide. It’s almost admirable, that kind of ruthless efficiency. She didn’t even wait for my final paycheck to clear before positioning herself to fill the vacuum. Some people just see a friend getting thrown overboard as a convenient promotion opportunity, a little extra room on the lifeboat.
