"He's scared, you know," the older man said, his voice a low rumble in the hushed quiet of the waiting room. He kept his gaze fixed on the scuffed linoleum, avoiding his daughter’s eyes. A woman sitting opposite them, pretending to read a magazine, saw the tremor in his hand as he adjusted his worn-out jacket. His daughter just shook her head, a single tear tracing a path down her cheek. "I can't sign it, Dad. What if...?" The sentence hung in the sterile air, heavy with unspoken possibilities. The old man finally looked up, his expression not of resolve, but of a deep, weary acceptance. "I know. It’s okay to be afraid. But we don't have the luxury of standing still." He slid the clipboard across the small table between them. The pen felt impossibly heavy in her hand, but as her fingers closed around it, a different kind of stillness settled over her. It wasn't peace. It was just the end of hesitation.
