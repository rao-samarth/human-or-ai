The final boarding call echoed off the tiled walls, and he held out the ticket, a flimsy piece of paper representing an entire future I couldn’t grasp. You don’t understand what you’re asking me to do. It’s not just a house or a job; it’s my mother. I look her in the eye every single morning. A woman nearby pretended to check her phone, but her attention was fixed on us, her expression a mixture of pity and judgment. He insisted this was my one chance for a life that was truly mine, but the life I already have is not a possession I can simply discard. It is a structure built on commitments I made when I was clear-headed, not swept away by this feeling. You're asking me to become someone who walks away, someone who puts their own happiness on a scale and finds it weighs more than a promise made to a dying woman. And I can’t. I just can’t be that person, not even for you.
