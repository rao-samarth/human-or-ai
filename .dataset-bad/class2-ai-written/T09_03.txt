The smell of charcoal and sunscreen hung in the air, a familiar backdrop to my uncle’s booming laugh. I tried to focus on it, on anything other than the knot tightening in my stomach. My mom drifted over, her smile so genuine it felt like a spotlight, and asked about the new apartment. The easy lie I’d constructed—that I loved the neighborhood, that the roommate was great—slipped out before I could stop it, tasting like rust. Every normal question felt like a carefully laid trap. She squeezed my arm, proud and unsuspecting, and the simple, loving gesture was so much heavier than any accusation could ever be. I watched my little cousins chase each other across the lawn, their shrieks of joy echoing in a space I no longer felt I deserved to occupy, just a ghost at the feast.
