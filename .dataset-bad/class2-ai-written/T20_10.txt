Alright, I'll admit it. To you lot, anyway. You don't judge. Every Saturday at the market, I’m Mr. Wholesome, telling the city folks about heritage seeds and the sacred bond between man and soil. I talk a big game about respecting the land, about letting nature run its course. They nod, they buy my overpriced kale, and they feel good about themselves. But then Tuesday night rolls around, the aphids are back, and my ‘sacred bond’ doesn’t seem to be paying the mortgage. So out comes the canister from the back of the shed—the one with the skull and crossbones that I swear I'll only use ‘this one last time.’ I walk these rows under the moon, spraying a fine chemical mist, whispering apologies you can't hear. It’s a quiet betrayal, isn't it? The soil probably knows.
