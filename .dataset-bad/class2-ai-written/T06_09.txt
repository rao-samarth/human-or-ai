The smoke detector went off for the third time, signaling another one of my barbecue-grill-pizza-tragedies. I scraped the charred dough off the grate with a defeated sigh, just as a glorious scent wafted over the fence from Gary’s yard next door. It wasn't the smell of burnt sacrifice, but of an authentic, wood-fired pizzeria. Peeking through a gap in the fence, I saw it: his new, gleaming, imported-from-Naples oven, glowing like a small, smug spaceship. Gary, wearing a pristine white apron that felt like a personal attack, expertly slid out a pizza with a perfectly leopard-spotted crust. He held it up for his wife, who actually clapped. Clapped! I looked down at my misshapen, semi-raw, semi-cremated disc of sadness and felt a dark certainty settle in my stomach. He didn’t just buy that oven for better pizza; he bought it to publicly broadcast my culinary failures across the neighborhood.
