The crystal glasses chimed with a delicate, expensive sound that seemed to hang in the air of the ballroom. From her corner near the ornate floral arrangement, she watched the groups form and dissolve like mercury. It wasn't about the designer labels or the weight of the jewelry, things she had learned to recognize. It was in the way they stood, a certain relaxed posture that came from never having to justify one's presence. They spoke in a shorthand of shared experiences—summers in places she only knew from magazines, schools that were institutions rather than just buildings. A quiet laugh would ripple through one cluster, an inside joke landing perfectly, and she would feel the distance not as a wall, but as a pane of thick, soundproof glass. She could see them clearly, their smiles and gestures, but the world they inhabited was an echo she couldn't quite catch, a tune played in a key she didn't know.
