Oh, look at Kevin, soaking it all in. The firm handshake from the regional director, the cheap champagne, the round of polite, dead-eyed applause. He’s a real go-getter, our new team lead. A true leader, after all, knows precisely when to “accidentally” misplace a rival’s crucial files right before a deadline. And a real innovator understands how to rephrase someone else’s pitch from last month's meeting, just loudly enough for the right people to think it was his brilliant idea all along. It’s genuinely inspiring to see that raw, unadulterated merit always finds a way to rise to the top. I should probably go congratulate him. Maybe I’ll ask for some career advice; I'm sure he'd tell me the secret is all about passion and a positive attitude.
