You have to see it from my side for just a moment. I saw the calendar invite for the anniversary party pop up while I was in that meeting with the regional board, the one I’d been preparing for all quarter. I just hit ‘Decline’ without thinking, assuming I’d call you right after to explain the scheduling conflict. I never imagined you’d interpret it as some grand, deliberate statement. But then your sister called, asking why I was trying to hurt Mom, and then Dad left that awful voicemail. Suddenly this tiny, thoughtless click of a button had become a declaration of war. By the time I got out of my meeting and saw the storm I’d created, it was already too late to simply fix it. You’d already told everyone I refused to come, and the story had taken on a life of its own. It wasn’t a statement; it was just a button. A stupid, thoughtless button.
