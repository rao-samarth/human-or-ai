Everyone else just screamed when little Timmy Gable went over the edge into Miller’s Quarry. But panic, I’ve always believed, is the real danger in these situations, not the water itself. While they were all shouting, I was assessing. The drop was maybe twelve feet. The water would be cold, a shock to the system for sure. A blind, headlong rush would just put a second person at risk, and I was not about to be that person. Just as I was about to call for someone to find a rope—the sensible approach—his teenage sister Sarah kicked off her shoes and plunged in after him. A purely hysterical reaction, really. They hauled Timmy out, sputtering and soaked, and now everyone in town calls her a hero. They don't see that her flailing was just dumb luck; my stillness was the product of actual thought, ready for the moment the right way.
