The air in the town hall crackled, thick with anger and the smell of damp coats. Councilman Miller stood at the podium, his smile a slick, reassuring line as he explained away the metallic sheen on Blackwood Creek. He held up a single, crisp page from a thick binder. "Just agricultural runoff," he declared, his voice booming with practiced confidence, citing a state report that confirmed everything was within approved safety levels. A murmur rippled through the packed room. Someone shoved a phone forward, the screen showing a blurry photo of silver fish, belly-up along the muddy bank. Miller didn’t flinch. He pivoted, launching into a passionate speech about the upcoming Founder’s Day parade, a distraction wrapped in civic pride. He didn’t mention the second, independent lab test his office had buried last Tuesday, nor the frantic calls from the old Henderson farm downstream. He just kept talking about the parade floats, painting a future so bright it blinded everyone to the poison in their own backyard.
