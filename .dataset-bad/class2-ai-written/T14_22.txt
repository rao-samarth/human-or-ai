I watch him accept the award, his smile perfectly rehearsed. It’s funny, he genuinely believes his own efforts brought him to this stage. He sees his life as a series of calculated moves, a ladder he climbed one deliberate rung at a time, and he’s proud of the view. What he doesn't see, what none of them see, are the subtle currents of pure chance that pushed him upward while a headwind held others back. He was in the right department when the project launched, met the right executive at the right charity dinner, said the right thing on a day when the universe just happened to be listening. We all tell ourselves these little stories about our choices mattering, but really, some people are just born to win. The rest of us are simply here to provide the applause.
