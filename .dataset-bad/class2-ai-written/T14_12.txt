The applause washes over the ballroom, a polite, rolling thunder for Elena up on the stage. She’s holding that heavy glass award, smiling into the lights like she was born for this. I remember her in that cramped cubicle next to mine, staying late, mapping out five-year plans on sticky notes. She had a will of iron; she built her own ladder, rung by painful rung. But then I also remember the director quitting unexpectedly, the server crash that wiped out everyone’s project but hers, the chance meeting in the elevator that led to her big break. She calls it dedication, and it was, but I can’t help wondering if her entire trajectory hinged on that one moment of pure, dumb luck. Are we all just one random event away from a different life, a different stage?
