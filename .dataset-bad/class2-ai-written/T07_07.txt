The Baron’s new edict, delivered by a man who looked like he’d never seen mud, was that all farm gates must be fitted with a standardized iron latch for “aesthetic unity and security.” It was a truly inspired solution to a problem that didn't exist. So, every morning, we watch old Elara hobble out to her gate, not with an iron latch, but with a different, brightly colored ribbon. Monday it was a defiant scarlet; Tuesday, a cheerful yellow that seemed to mock the grey sky. She just ties it around the weathered wood and goes about her day. The Baron’s steward delivers a new notice of non-compliance each afternoon, which she presumably uses as kindling. We all nod sagely as we pass her little protest, whispering about her courage. We’re all so very proud of her, right up until we go home and dutifully polish our own stupid, identical iron latches.
