I was trying to mind my own business at the bus stop, but it was impossible not to overhear the two guys in suits next to me. The younger one was shaking his head, looking stressed. "I just don't know, man. The client specifically asked for that safety report to be included, unedited." The older one just laughed, a short, sharp sound. "And they will get *a* report. Listen to me. What’s more important? A footnote in a document nobody reads, or the commission that pays off your mortgage? It’s a simple choice. We just omit one little chart. It's not lying; it's strategic presentation. They get their product, we get paid, and everyone moves on. By the time anyone even thinks to look that deep, we’ll be on to the next three projects. You have to see the bigger picture, which is your bank account." The bus pulled up then, hissing its brakes, and they both got on, leaving the ethical dilemma hanging in the exhaust fumes.
