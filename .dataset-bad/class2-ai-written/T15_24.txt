I should be listening to my table-mate drone on about his boat, but I can’t. My focus is stuck across the room, on the watch circling the wrist of her new boyfriend. It’s a vintage model, silver with a dark blue face, and every time he moves, the light catches it just so. He’s laughing now, arm slung around her shoulders, and the second hand sweeps past the twelve. Again. I’ve counted one hundred and seventeen sweeps, my own heart trying to match its impossible rhythm. Thump-tick. Thump-tick. Someone at my table asks if I’m okay, and I just nod, but my gaze is locked on that tiny, circling needle. I start to wonder how many seconds they’ve been together. How many ticks of that specific watch has she seen? The clinking of glasses and the awful band music all fade into a dull hum; there's only the steady, relentless beat of time moving on without me, and I have to know what brand it is. I just have to know.
