You keep asking me to trust the process, to let the system decide what is fair. From my apartment window, I can see a thousand other windows, a thousand other lives moving in the relentless rhythm of the city, and it makes the official channels feel so small and impersonal. They talk about restitution and consequences, about balancing scales with cold, hard facts recorded in a file. But that isn't what this is about. Their version of what is right is a procedure, a tidy resolution meant to satisfy a legal code, not a human soul. What I'm talking about is something else entirely; it’s about a direct and personal reckoning. It isn't a thirst for causing equal pain, but a need for the person responsible to truly understand the specific weight of their actions, away from the sterile theater of a courtroom. When a formal system offers only an abstract solution for a concrete wound, you start to question who truly holds the authority to define what is just.
