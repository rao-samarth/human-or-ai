Amelia’s praise still echoed in my ears, but the warmth of her words felt like a cheap coat in a blizzard. She’d smiled, that perfectly calibrated corporate smile, and told the whole team my project was "a real game-changer." I saw the flicker in her eyes, though. It was the same look she gave Mark right before his department was "restructured" into nonexistence. Everyone else bought it, of course; they nodded along, their own masks of earnest support firmly in place. They don't see the little tells. I do. I’ve learned to. You have to, in a place like this, where every compliment is a potential landmine and every friendly chat is an interrogation. I just nodded and smiled back, a perfect mirror of her own performance. She thinks she has me figured out, but she has no idea what’s really running on my desktop behind the approved spreadsheets.
