You’re all staring, and I get it. From where you sit, it looks like I sold him out. But nobody here seems to remember the phone calls at three in the morning, or the sheer panic when we realized the numbers didn’t add up. They put a choice in front of me, a simple one on paper but impossible in real life. Option A: we both go down with the ship, taking our families with us. Option B: I take their deal, which guts the company we built and forces you out, but saves my house and gives you just enough severance to land on your feet. They told me you would hate me for it, but that you would survive. I had to decide if our shared dream was worth more than your actual future. So I signed the papers. Call it what you want, but I made the only call I could to make sure you didn't lose absolutely everything.
