The old stone well on the boundary line is capped now, sealed with a slab of concrete that looks jarringly new against the weathered fieldstone. It’s strange to think that the silence between our two houses began with a simple conversation about the low water table last August. I had mentioned, quite casually, that we should probably be mindful of usage until the autumn rains. My neighbor, however, must have heard something else entirely—a challenge, perhaps, or a prelude to a formal claim. A week later, instead of talking, he sent a registered letter from his solicitor outlining historical water rights. Stung by the sudden, cold formality of it all, I responded in kind. Now, a heavy-duty fence runs directly through the spot where we once stood talking, and the well that served both our families for generations is a useless, sealed monument to a conversation that went wrong.
