The speaker on stage, a celebrated philanthropist, adjusted his microphone and spoke with grave sincerity about the urgent need for humility and resource conservation. His voice echoed through the grand ballroom, where chandeliers dripped crystal light onto tables groaning with imported delicacies and floral arrangements that would wilt by morning. He passionately decried the culture of excess, prompting solemn nods from attendees whose diamond necklaces and gold-plated watches caught the light. A waiter refilled my water glass for the third time, the bottle’s distant, alpine origin proudly displayed on its label. As the speech reached its crescendo, a call for a return to simpler living, the audience erupted in thunderous applause, their collective enthusiasm a stark, glittering contrast to the message they so readily consumed.
