I spotted the wallet on the grimy pavement, its expensive leather a stark contrast to the chewing gum stains. A quick glance at the driver's license inside showed a man with a distinct beard, and then I saw him—or who I thought was him—fifty feet ahead, unmistakable in a bright yellow chicken suit, handing out flyers for a new restaurant. My heroic charge through the throng of tourists and lunch-breakers was less a sprint and more a desperate, stumbling weave. "Sir! You dropped this!" I yelled, but my voice was swallowed by a passing siren. Finally reaching him, I tapped the giant foam shoulder, breathless, and held up the wallet like a hard-won prize. The giant chicken head lifted to reveal the face of a bewildered teenager, definitely not the middle-aged man from the photo. He just stared at me, then at the wallet, as a small crowd began to notice the strange transaction. I was left holding someone else's property, having accosted a poultry-themed marketer, and suddenly the simple, noble act of returning a lost item felt like the most complicated, idiotic decision I had ever made.
