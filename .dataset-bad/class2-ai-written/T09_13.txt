The airport terminal hums with a sterile, impersonal energy, a thousand journeys intersecting without consequence. I’m just another face in the crowd, hunched over a lukewarm coffee in a paper cup. This anonymity should be a relief, a welcome shroud for what I did, but it isn't. Instead, every garbled announcement over the loudspeaker sounds like my name being called, a summons I can’t answer. My phone buzzes on the table, a single unread message glowing on the dark screen. I know who it’s from. My thumb hovers over the notification, a tiny act of cowardice, before I flip the device face down. The vibration stops, but the silence that follows is somehow louder, a hollow space filled with the words I should have said and the ones I can never take back. I'm stuck here, between a gate that won't open and a past I can't leave behind.
