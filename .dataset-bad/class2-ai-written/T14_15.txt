The train swayed gently, a rhythmic pulse carrying us through the deepening twilight. Outside, the landscape blurred into a watercolor of soft greens and purples. A single light flickered on in a distant farmhouse, a tiny spark of life in the vast, quiet land, and I wondered about the people inside. Did they dream of this life, this specific plot of earth and this view from their window? Or was it simply the place they ended up, the result of a thousand small, unnoticeable accidents and compromises that eventually hardened into a reality? It felt much like this journey. I had bought the ticket, yes, and I had boarded at the station, but the tracks were already laid, stretching into a darkness I couldn't yet see. Each new town was just a name flashing past the window, another stop on a line drawn long before I ever arrived, and my own destination began to feel less like a choice and more like an inevitability I was simply riding towards.
