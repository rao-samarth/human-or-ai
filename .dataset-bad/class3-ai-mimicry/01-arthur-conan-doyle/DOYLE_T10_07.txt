Pray, cast your eye upon that vociferous gentleman holding forth by the public fountain. With a theatricality that would not be out of place at the Lyceum, he has convinced his little band of followers—all of them scribbling furiously into their notebooks—that this common municipal feature is a relic of some forgotten druidic order. He asserts its waters will cure a case of melancholia; and observe how they hang upon his every word, as though he were dispensing the very secrets of the universe. The simple truth, etched upon a brass plaque half-obscured by grime, is that the device was installed by the Metropolitan Water Board in 1898. Yet why should a dull fact be permitted to interfere with such a magnificent and profitable fabrication? The man has not so much presented a falsehood as he has offered a far more palatable and interesting reality, and for that, it seems, his audience is most profoundly grateful.
