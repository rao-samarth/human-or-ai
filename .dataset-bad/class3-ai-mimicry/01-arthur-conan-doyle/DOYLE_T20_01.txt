It was Mr. Abernathy’s custom, upon the first Monday of each month, to deliver a lecture to the junior clerks upon the virtues of economy and the solemn duty of preserving the firm’s resources. He spoke this morning with particular vehemence against the profligate use of stationery, his great voice echoing amongst the ledgers; yet all the while, he had taken up a fresh sheet of the finest watermarked bond—a paper reserved, I might add, for correspondence of the utmost importance—and was idly sketching upon it a rather poor caricature of a horse. Having exhausted his point on the egregious cost of fine ink, he then, without a moment’s hesitation, crumpled the entire sheet into a tight ball and tossed it with remarkable inaccuracy towards the waste-paper basket. Several of the young men exchanged furtive glances, and I confess I was forced to study a most interesting crack in the ceiling, lest my own expression betray an amusement wholly inappropriate to the gravity of his pronouncements.
