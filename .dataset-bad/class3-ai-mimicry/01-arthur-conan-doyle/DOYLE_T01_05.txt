You ask after Albright, my dear fellow, and I find myself observing him even now across this glittering ballroom. He is, of course, the celebrated man of the hour, and he receives the endless stream of congratulations with a practiced smile; however, a man with any eye for character might perceive the curious vacancy in his gaze. I recall well the feverish energy with which he pursued this grand enterprise, dismissing all counsel and brushing aside friendships as mere impediments to his singular, all-consuming goal. Now, he stands entirely alone amidst the throng, his countenance a mask of weary triumph, and I cannot help but think of the lamentable affair with poor Bradshaw, whose ruin was the very foundation of this new fortune. He has, by all accounts, achieved everything he once desired, yet in doing so, he appears to have hollowed himself out, leaving behind nothing more than a polished shell—a monument to a victory purchased at a price no sane man would willingly pay.
