You champion the cause of public morality, Chilton, with a fervour that might persuade the very angels; your pamphlets denouncing the slightest private vice are, I am told, required reading in certain households. And yet, I find you here at this ungodly hour, your hand trembling as you plead for my silence on a matter that is not merely a vice, but a felony. It is a most singular philosophy you profess—one which places the purity of the common man’s soul upon a pedestal whilst its own architect engages in crude forgery beneath the cloak of darkness. Pray, do not insult my intelligence by appealing to some higher, convoluted purpose. Tell me plainly: is the law a rigid staff for the backs of the poor, but a pliable reed in the hands of gentlemen such as yourself?
