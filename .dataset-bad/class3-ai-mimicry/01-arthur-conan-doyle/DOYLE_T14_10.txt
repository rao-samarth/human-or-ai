From my study window overlooking the sodden lawns of the estate, I watched a solitary copper leaf detach itself from the high branches of an ancient beech. It did not fall directly, but rather danced upon the air, twisting in a most erratic fashion—now darting left, now spinning back upon its course as if possessed of some desperate, private volition. One might almost fancy it was striving to direct its own descent, to choose its final resting place upon the damp earth. Yet I knew full well that its every flutter was but the consequence of some unseen current, a hapless particle caught in a contest of forces it could neither comprehend nor resist. And so it is, I fancy, with the lives of men; we chart our courses with such earnest conviction, battling against the gales of misfortune, never quite certain whether our triumphs are born of our own cunning or are merely the fortunate accidents of an indifferent and predestined wind.
