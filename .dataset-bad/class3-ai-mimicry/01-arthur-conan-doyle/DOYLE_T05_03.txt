From my study window, I watched her slow promenade along the high street, a spectacle which, for all its placid, Sunday morning propriety, never failed to stir a most profound disquiet within me. She walked upon the arm of her husband, the stout and worthy solicitor to whom she was bound by a promise made long before she and I had ever met—a promise she could not, in all honour, forsake. It was my own solemn charge, as the village curate, to offer a civil greeting as they passed, to inquire after the man’s affairs, and to affect a complete ignorance of the silent appeal I so often perceived in her downcast eyes. Such was the part I had to play, a small and bitter drama enacted upon the cobblestones; for I knew, as surely as I knew my catechism, that her heart was no more in that union than mine was in my hollow salutations, yet the lines of our lives had been drawn, and we were bound to walk them, though they should run parallel to all eternity, never to converge.
