I have often observed that a man’s self-regard is a most fragile and precarious vessel, easily navigated in calm waters but dashed to pieces upon the first reef of public scrutiny. Young Sedgwick in accounts, for instance, had for weeks carried himself with an air of such supreme and unassailable competence that one might have thought him the proprietor himself, dismissing the diligent methods of his elders with a confident wave of the hand. He spoke of his own ‘systematic logic’ as if he alone held the patent upon the science. Yesterday, however, before the entire board, old Mr. Henderson quietly enquired about a single figure on the third page of Sedgwick’s grand proposal. It was a small thing, a trifle, yet upon that one misplaced decimal the whole magnificent structure was founded. To see the colour drain from the lad’s face, to watch that erect posture crumple into a sudden, intense study of his own shoes, was a lesson more potent than any lecture; the grand edifice of his certainty, built so high, had been brought to ruin by a single, humble fact.
