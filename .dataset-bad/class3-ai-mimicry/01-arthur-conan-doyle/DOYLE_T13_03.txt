You see, my dear fellow, the peril was never in the facts themselves—which were, I grant you, quite plain—but in the towering edifice of self-assurance you constructed upon them. You held your theory to be an indisputable fortress, yet it was built upon the shifting sands of mere conjecture, a foundation I warned you was entirely too treacherous. A man who stands upon such a precipice, so convinced of his own unassailable genius that he scoffs at a word of caution, is but one contrary breeze from a most dreadful and public tumble. And what a tumble it has been! Your face, hitherto a mask of supreme confidence, now betrays a truth far more potent than any of your grand deductions. There is no recovery from such a blow, I fear, not without first admitting that the dizzying height from which one fell was entirely of one’s own making.
