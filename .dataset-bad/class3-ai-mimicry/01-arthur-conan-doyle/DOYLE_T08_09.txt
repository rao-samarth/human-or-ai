You condemn my actions, I perceive, believing them born of some sudden and volatile passion; and yet, you must concede that passion is a feverish, blinding force, whilst the consequence I delivered was as cold and as meticulously weighed as a chemist’s formula. True settlement is not a thing of heated blood, for that is mere animal reprisal, a frantic snapping of jaws in the dark. It is, instead, a question of arithmetic, of restoring a dreadful imbalance. The courts and their wigs are a clumsy apparatus, designed for the masses; they cannot measure the slow poison of a decade’s malice, nor can they calculate the precise payment required. To see an evil, to understand its exact weight and dimension, and then to apply an equal and opposing force to nullify it—that is not a matter for the mob or the magistrate. It is a terrible burden which falls, by necessity, upon the one man who sees the equation in its entirety.
