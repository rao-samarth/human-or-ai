Pray, calm yourself, for your present agitation is not, I think, a rational response to the circumstances. You have taken against Mr. Harrington with a vehemence that is quite disproportionate to any offence he has committed. I have observed you, my dear sir, and I deduce that your grievance is not with the man himself, but with the shadow he casts, in which you fear you are now obscured. Every word of praise directed towards his recent triumphs you have taken as a personal slight, and his simple, unaffected friendship with our mutual acquaintance has kindled in you a most unfortunate and baseless suspicion. It is a malady of the spirit, this; a slow poison distilled from the comparison of one’s own lot with another's, which clouds the judgement and turns a man's most steadfast companions into imagined adversaries.
