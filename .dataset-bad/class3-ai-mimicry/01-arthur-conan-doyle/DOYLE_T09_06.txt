It has become my grim custom to walk the lane past the old vicarage at dusk, for it is a peculiar species of torment to witness the consequences of one's own folly. The townsfolk, who once met my eye with a ready smile, now offer but a curt nod, their glances sliding away as if from some distasteful object. I had thought it such a small thing, a mere whisper of a suggestion to Mr Abernathy regarding his competitor's accounts—a word planted in fertile soil to advance my own prospects. Yet that seed of deceit has grown into a monstrous weed, choking the life from an honest man's business, and I alone know that I am the gardener. The true horror of it is that my own reputation remains quite intact; the villain of the piece walks amongst them undetected, save for the incessant, damning verdict delivered by the court that sits in perpetual session within his own breast.
