I was observing my young cousin from across the dining table, where his father—my uncle—was holding forth with boisterous impertinence upon the boy’s recent commercial failure. A lesser man might have flushed with anger, or worse, offered some stammering, pathetic defence. My cousin, however, did neither. He simply placed his linen napkin beside his plate, rose with a composure that belied his years, and offered a slight, formal bow. “You will forgive me, sir,” he stated, his voice perfectly even, “but I find I cannot remain where my own industry is a subject for public amusement.” The cost of that quiet stand was, I have no doubt, a considerable portion of his future inheritance; yet what is a fortune when weighed against the very substance of a man’s self-respect? He understood, you see, a most fundamental principle: that a slur left unanswered festers into an accepted truth in the minds of others, and that to guard one’s good name is not an act of vanity, but a simple, calculated necessity.
