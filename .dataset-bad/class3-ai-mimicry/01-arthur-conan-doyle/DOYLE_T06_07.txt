Pray, turn your attention to the gentleman standing near the orchestra, the one affecting an air of detached amusement. Observe him now, as the young Marquess—celebrated for his recent and quite brilliant diplomatic coup—is led into a dance by the beautiful Miss Albright. See there!

It is a fleeting spasm, to be sure, and one that he has already mastered with a supreme effort of will, but in that unguarded instant we have witnessed the raw, unvarnished soul of a man consumed by the triumphs of another.
