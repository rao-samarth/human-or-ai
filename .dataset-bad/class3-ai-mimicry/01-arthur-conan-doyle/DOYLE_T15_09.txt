My cousin Alistair’s singular fixation upon the missing timepiece had, I fear, now curdled into something altogether more poisonous. He stood before the drawing-room fire, his face unnaturally flushed and his knuckles white upon the mantelpiece, ignoring our aunt’s gentle entreaties to be seated. His wild eyes, however, were fixed not upon the assembled company, but upon his own brother Edward, a mild-mannered curate who now looked the very picture of astonishment. In his trembling hand Alistair brandished a letter, which he proclaimed with a voice shaking with conviction to be irrefutable proof of the young man’s treachery. I knew the letter to be a harmless note concerning a shared investment, its contents twisted by a mind now perilously unmoored from reason. And so I was faced with a most dreadful choice: to speak and shatter the fragile peace of the evening, perhaps pushing Alistair over some final, terrible precipice, or to hold my tongue and by my silence become complicit in this monstrous and public slander.
