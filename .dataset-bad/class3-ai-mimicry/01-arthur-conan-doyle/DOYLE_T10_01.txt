It was a most singular exhibition of domestic warfare, and I confess I watched the old aunt with a professional interest. She cornered her young niece by the fireplace, her voice a low, confidential murmur, yet every word carried the calculated precision of an arrow loosed at a specific target. There was no outright slander, you understand; that would have been a clumsy instrument, entirely beneath her. Instead, she presented a perfectly accurate statement—that the girl’s brother had indeed sold a parcel of land without consulting the family—and allowed it to hang in the air, a damning indictment in itself. She omitted, with the skill of a master strategist, the vital context that the sale had been a desperate measure to settle their late father’s ruinous debts. The girl’s face fell, her trust visibly eroded by this poisoned half-truth, and the old woman, perceiving her victory, gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod of satisfaction.
