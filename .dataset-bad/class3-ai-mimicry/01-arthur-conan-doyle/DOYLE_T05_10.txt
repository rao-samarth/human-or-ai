The endless river of humanity upon the Strand flowed about my person with a profound indifference, each soul preoccupied with its own small commerce or private tragedy. I had made my choice, a decision founded not upon the whims of the heart but upon the granite of a sworn oath—a pact that secured the fortunes of two families and upheld a promise made at a father’s deathbed. It was the correct and logical course, the only one which a gentleman of principle could pursue. Yet the briefest, most accidental glimpse of her that afternoon, stepping from a hansom near Charing Cross, had been sufficient to shatter my resolve into a thousand glittering fragments. What is this affliction, this singular madness which urges a man to cast aside all reason and honour for a mere memory of a smile? My feet carried me on, perforce, but my soul remained there upon the pavement, hopelessly divided—a wretch torn between the life he was bound to live and the one for which he would willingly die.
