It was a curious and lamentable spectacle there upon the bustling thoroughfare, where two men, erstwhile partners in some commercial venture, now stood upon the brink of utter ruin. The taller of the two, his face a mask of indignation, brandished a crumpled telegram. “I had your solemn assurance, sir!” he exclaimed, his voice rising above the din of the horse-drawn omnibuses. “You were to secure the shares before the exchange opened!” His companion, a portly man with a bewildered expression, threw his hands up in a gesture of despair. “And so I did!” he cried. “I secured them for myself, as a sign of good faith in our joint enterprise!” A dreadful silence fell between them, in which the fatal misinterpretation of that simple pronoun hung heavier than the city fog. The first man tore the paper in two. “Then you have played me for a fool, and our association is at an end. I bid you good day, and may you enjoy your newfound solitude.” He turned on his heel and was swallowed by the crowd, leaving the other to stare, dumbfounded, at his own calamitous success.
