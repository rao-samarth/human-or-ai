Our progress through the countryside, hitherto a model of tranquil locomotion, was abruptly disturbed by a most unwelcome passenger. The creature—a common bumblebee, I should add—had no sooner entered our compartment than a general state of alarm prevailed. A stout woman gave a piercing cry, whilst her husband flapped at the air with a copy of *The Times*, achieving little beyond fanning the insect’s fury to a perilous degree. And yet, my companion, Mr. Abernathy, a man whose chief distinction thus far had been his remarkable capacity for slumber, showed no such trepidation. With a stillness that bordered upon the sublime, he removed his top hat, watched the bee’s erratic course for a moment, and then, with a swift, economical flick of the wrist, captured the buzzing miscreant within its felt confines. He calmly replaced the hat upon his head—containing, as it now did, the source of our collective terror—and tipped its brim to the astonished lady with a faint, apologetic smile.
