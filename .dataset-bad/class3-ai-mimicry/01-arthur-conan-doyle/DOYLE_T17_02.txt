From my corner of the railway carriage, I could not help but overhear the two gentlemen opposite, their voices rising in a ludicrous dispute over some misplaced document. How often have I observed such a scene, and how frequently does it call to mind the lamentable case of Colonel Armitage and his young ward. There, the entire catastrophe—a shattered engagement, a sullied reputation, and a promising career brought to ruin—was precipitated not by malice, but by a simple message delayed in the post. A single sentence, read a day too late, twisted an innocent explanation into a confession of guilt. All subsequent protestations were viewed through this new, distorted lens, and the obstinate pride of both parties forbade the simple inquiry which would have set all to rights. It is a dreadful thing, indeed, to witness a life undone by so trifling a cause; a foundation of trust demolished by a seed of doubt sown entirely by mischance.
