It is a popular and indeed a rather charming conceit that a man is the architect of his own fortune. From my vantage upon this grassy bank, I observe the farmer toiling in his ancestral patch, and I have no doubt he imagines himself the captain of his soul; a man of deliberate action and firm resolve. What an amusing fallacy! His fortunes are not forged by his own hand, but are instead governed by the caprice of the weather; a sudden blight or an unexpected frost determines his prosperity far more than any decision he might make. We are all of us, I suspect, little more than ants, industriously marching along a line of our own devising until some trifling accident—the indifferent heel of a passing giant—eradicates our path and our purpose in a single, meaningless moment. To speak of charting one’s own course is the ultimate vanity, for we are but leaves spun about in a current, congratulating ourselves on our clever navigation as we are swept inexorably towards the falls.
