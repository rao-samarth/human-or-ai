It was upon the Dover line that I witnessed a most instructive little drama, one which confirmed a theory I have long held concerning the subtle yet impassable gulfs that separate one station of man from another. The gentleman in question, a portly fellow with a florid countenance, wore a suit of the finest tweed, yet it sat upon him with the discomfort of a borrowed costume. His wife, a flutter of nerves and Parisian silks, fussed over their luggage with an anxiety that bespoke its recent acquisition; their son, a lad of ten, stared about with the wide-eyed wonder of one unaccustomed to such travel. A trifling tip, over-large and ostentatiously given to the porter, confirmed the entire diagnosis. Here was wealth, indubitably, but not a single generation of it. They possessed all the necessary articles for the performance, you see, but had not the faintest notion of the quiet confidence which is the true inheritance of a gentleman, a quality that cannot be purchased at any price.
