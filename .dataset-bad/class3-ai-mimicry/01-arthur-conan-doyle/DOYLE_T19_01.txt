The public estimation of Constable Pettigrew was, I must confess, a monument to the fallibility of human perception. Here was a man whose very presence seemed to quell any nascent disturbance; a great, booming barrel of a fellow with a moustache of such ferocious proportions that it might well have intimidated a cavalry horse. His scowl was a permanent fixture, etched upon a countenance of weathered granite, and his pronouncements on local bylaws were delivered with the finality of a judge's sentence. Yet, I had the singular good fortune to observe him one Tuesday afternoon when a common garden butterfly, a simple Pieris rapae, had the temerity to flutter near his helmet. The transformation was astonishing! The granite crumbled, the scowl vanished, and in its place was the wide-eyed terror of a schoolboy confronting a ghost. He flapped at the air with a hand the size of a dinner plate, a low whimper escaping his lips, proving that the most formidable of shells may house the most unexpectedly tender of kernels.
