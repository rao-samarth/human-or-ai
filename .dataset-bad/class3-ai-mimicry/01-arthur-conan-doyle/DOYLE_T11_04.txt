It was in one of those public omnibuses, rattling its way towards Knightsbridge, that I observed a most instructive, if minor, social calamity. A lady of considerable bearing, whose very posture bespoke a life unacquainted with shared benches, found her silk skirts imperilled by the wicker basket of a stout fellow redolent of honest labour and, I rather suspect, kippers. The vehicle, taking a corner with more enthusiasm than grace, had precipitated this unfortunate contact. Her reaction was a masterpiece of silent protest; a minute recoil, a tightening of the lips, and an almost imperceptible angling of her person away from the offending basket, as if it were a source of some noxious vapour. The man, for his part, remained blissfully ignorant of the social chasm he had bridged with his wares, even offering a hearty remark upon the weather which was met with a silence more glacial than any January frost. It was a perfect demonstration of those unwritten laws which govern us more strictly than any Act of Parliament.
