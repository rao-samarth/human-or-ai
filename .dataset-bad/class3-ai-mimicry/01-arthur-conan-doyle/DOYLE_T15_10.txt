You may well ask what drove me to such an extremity, and I shall tell you it was nothing more than the persistent, rhythmic drumming of that man’s silver signet ring against the carriage window. At first it was a trifling annoyance, a mere punctuation to the rattle of the rails; yet, as the miles wore on, the simple sound began to acquire a most sinister and deliberate quality. It became a communication, a mocking cadence directed at the very foundation of my composure. I began to perceive in its ceaseless tattoo a vile and personal narrative, a story of my own failings tapped out in a code I could not break but whose meaning I felt in my very soul. It was no longer metal upon glass; it was an intolerable persecution, an assault from which there was no quarter. When a man’s own mind is thus besieged by so insidious a foe, what choice has he but to silence the battery at any cost?
