There is, I have found, no vanity so pronounced as that of the Englishman abroad who fancies he has mastered the intricate timetables and local peculiarities of a foreign railway. My travelling companion on the line to Marseilles, a portly gentleman of some commercial standing, had assured me with the unshakeable certainty of a man who has never been wrong that our express was the swiftest to the coast. He dismissed my own humble consultation of the schedule as the work of an amateur. Yet, as the hours dragged on and our locomotive ambled through every forgotten hamlet and provincial siding, the truth of the matter became painfully apparent. He did not speak again for the remainder of the journey; he merely stared fixedly out of the window at a sun-bleached landscape which must have seemed to him, I fancy, a sprawling and undeniable monument to his own folly.
