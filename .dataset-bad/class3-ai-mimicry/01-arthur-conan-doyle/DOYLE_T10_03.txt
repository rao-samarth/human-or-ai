Observe, my dear fellow, the curious predicament of the two travellers opposite. The gentleman, with a grand flourish of his railway timetable, insists with unshakeable conviction that the 4:19 express from Lower Gillford is, in fact, the very same service as the 4:22 stopping-train from Upper Gillford, the latter merely being a colloquial name for the former. His wife, a woman of practical mien, points with a certain weary logic to the plain fact that they are two distinct entries on the page. But see how he operates! He concedes the separate listings, calling them a “printer’s superfluity,” whilst directing her entire attention to the shared destination, which he declares the only salient point of fact. By withholding one truth—that a three-minute difference and a separate line-item invariably indicate a different train—he has weaponized another, using the common terminus as an unassailable fortress from which to defend his initial, and quite frankly absurd, declaration. It is a masterful, if infuriating, piece of domestic sophistry.
