You remonstrate with me, Henderson, upon a matter of some trifling expediency—the adjustment of a ledger for the firm’s greater good, a measure I deemed necessary in a moment of commercial crisis. Yet, was it not you I observed but yesterday, idling for a full quarter-hour past the appointed luncheon break? I put it to you that there exists a profound and lamentable difference between the two acts. One is a calculated manoeuvre for the preservation of our collective enterprise, a thing demanding foresight and a certain moral courage to execute. The other, your own transgression, is naught but the base surrender of a weak disposition to the simple vice of indolence. It is the principle of the thing, you understand; a small leak, if left unattended, may sink a great ship, and I shall not have this establishment founder upon the shoals of your tardiness.
