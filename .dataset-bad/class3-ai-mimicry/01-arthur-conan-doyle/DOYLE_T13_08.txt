My companion, having discoursed for the better part of an hour upon the precise mechanics of the angler’s art, at last made his grand attempt. He had dismissed the local wisdom as mere superstition, you see, and with a flourish worthy of a stage magician, he prepared to demonstrate the superiority of pure, scientific reason. The costly new rod whipped back, a marvel of bamboo and engineering, and then forward in what he had assured me was the perfect arc. I must confess, the result was a spectacle of a most singular nature. Instead of landing his fly upon the tranquil surface of the stream, his entire apparatus became hopelessly entangled in the low-hanging boughs of a willow, and in his frantic effort to retrieve it, he lost his footing upon the slick riverbank. The ignominious splash which followed, and the sight of my learned friend floundering in six inches of mud, provided a more eloquent commentary on the perils of vanity than any I could have composed myself.
