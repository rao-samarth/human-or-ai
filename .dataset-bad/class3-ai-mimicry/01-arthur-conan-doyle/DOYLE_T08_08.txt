You may call my actions a base form of retribution, a mere settling of personal accounts, but I put it to you, gentlemen, that there is a vast and terrible gulf between the two. To seek redress for a personal slight is one thing—a matter for the hot-blooded and the foolish. But to methodically expose a rot that threatens the very foundations of this firm, to ensure that the scales which have for so long been weighted by deception are brought crashing back to equilibrium; that, I contend, is an entirely different enterprise. The junior partner’s downfall was but a necessary consequence, not the objective itself. The true objective was the restoration of order, a principle which you, in your haste to avoid scandal, have utterly disregarded. You sought a quiet resolution; I sought a righteous one. Hence, whilst you may now cast me out for my methods, I ask you to consider who, in the final analysis, truly served the interests of this establishment: the man who concealed a poison for his own comfort, or the one who, at great personal cost, administered the only possible antidote?
