So you have it all, then? The title, the directorship, the fawning sycophants who now orbit your considerable fortune like so many witless moons. Pray, do not trouble yourself to recount the particulars of your ascent; I have observed its trajectory with a rather morbid fascination. Each rung of that ladder you so nimbly climbed was, I perceive, fashioned from the good name of some unfortunate associate, and every polished step was greased with a promise you had no intention of keeping. You call it pragmatism, I believe? A most ingenious term for what the common man, in his vulgar simplicity, might call rank treachery. Tell me, old friend, when you survey your grand estate, does the spectre of your own integrity ever wander its halls? Or did you lock that particular ghost in the cellar long ago, lest it disturb your digestion?
