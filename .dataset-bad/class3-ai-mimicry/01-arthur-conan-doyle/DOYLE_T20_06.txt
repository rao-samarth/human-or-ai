The fire had died to embers, and the house lay in that profound stillness which only the deepest hours of night can afford. I sat for some time contemplating the volume of moral philosophy left open upon the side table, and it struck me as a most singular and persistent folly of our species that a man might spend his evenings engrossed in the loftiest principles of rectitude, only to rise on the morrow and engage in some petty chicanery over a business ledger. He will champion the unassailable virtue of honesty in the abstract; yet, when presented with the opportunity for some small, advantageous deceit, he will seize upon it with an alacrity that is quite breathtaking. It is not, I think, a conscious duplicity. Rather, it is a profound and almost comical blindness to the chasm which separates the noble sentiments he so readily espouses from the grubby reality of his own conduct. Indeed, were a man to truly see himself in a mirror that reflected not his face but his principles in action, the resulting spectacle would, I fancy, provide more startling amusement than any stage play.
