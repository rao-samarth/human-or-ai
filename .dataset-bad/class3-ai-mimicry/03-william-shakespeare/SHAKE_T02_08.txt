So here, before you all, I cast this borrowed seeming to the floor. For twenty years I have played the duteous son, the loving brother, a man of simple faith and honest means; yet all this while, my soul wore a different garment, one stitched with envy and a most ambitious thread. I smiled when my heart did curse your fortune; I offered praise when my mind did plot a ruinous fall. This feigned humility, this mask of sweet content, hath been my closest friend and my most cruel tormentor. It hath won me your trust, aye, the very prize I sought, and in the winning, it hath cost me mine own self. Now the play is done, the lights are quenched, and you see before you not the man you loved, but the hollow actor who remains when his part is finished.
