You count amongst you the lost acres and the squandered gold, judging my choice a madman's folly; yet what worth have such worldly chattels when the very breath of a man's being, his unblemished name, is called into question? This is the one true patrimony, passed from father to son, more precious than any deed or title. Let slander's foul tongue but once touch it, and the stain spreads like a plague, making a mockery of all other wealth. A man may lose his house, his lands, his purse, and by industry find them again; but let him suffer his character to be forfeit, and he becomes a ghost in his own life, a hollow shape whose every virtue is henceforth disbelieved. Therefore, I have spent what you call a fortune, for what is all the coin in the kingdom if it cannot buy back that which is priceless?
