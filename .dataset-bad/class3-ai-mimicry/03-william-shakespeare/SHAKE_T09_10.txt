Alas, what devil’s bargain hath my belly struck with my own spirit? Forsooth, the prize was but a goose, a creature of mere feather and fat, yet it sits now in this wicker cage like a magistrate sent to pronounce my doom. Its every honk doth seem to cry ‘Thief!’ upon the gentle country air, and I swear the very spiders in the rafters cease their spinning to better hear my accusation. I thought to have a noble feast, to silence the rumbling protest of my gut, but what feast is this? A banquet of sour regret, where every imagined bite tastes of my neighbour’s righteous fury. To cook the bird were to confirm the crime; to set it free, to publish my shame to all the parish. O, wretched man, to be so undone by poultry! Better I had starved than be so haunted by a goose, whose honking judgment is a torment far fouler than any hunger.
