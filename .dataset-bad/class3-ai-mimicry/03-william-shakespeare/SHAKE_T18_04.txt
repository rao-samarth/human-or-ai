Observe yon bustling thoroughfare, where every man proceeds as if his own small purpose were the chiefest business of the age. Each soul, a world unto himself, charts his course with grave and solemn import. Yet mark how heaven makes a toy of such designs! A dropped purse, a startled horse, a merchant’s sudden sneeze—any such trifle serves to knot the threads of these great enterprises into a most perplexing snarl. The grand procession of a dignitary is halted by a runaway pig; a lover's whispered vow is drowned by the clang of a dropped kettle. And in this sudden, witless disarray, a strange and potent mirth is born. For it is in the very ruin of our sober calculations that we are shown our true and foolish nature, and are compelled to laugh at the grand, unwritten farce in which we all, unwittingly, are players.
