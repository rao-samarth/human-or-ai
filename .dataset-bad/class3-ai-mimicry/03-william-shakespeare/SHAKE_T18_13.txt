Forsooth, a greater fool than our new clerk, one Barnaby, nature hath not yet devised. The Master, in a fit of hasty temper, did dispatch the boy with an urgent ledger to the chandler's shop, with stern command it not be mistook for the tailor's accounts. But this pigeon-witted knave, his mind a vacant plain where good sense goes to die, didst trip upon a loose cobble and, in his fall, sent a cascade of like-bound books tumbling from a passing cart. What then? He snatches up a volume, any volume, and, puffing with misplaced pride, presents to the vexed chandler a most delicate book of sonnets, meant for a lady's hand. And so, the chandler now believes our Master woos him with poor verse, the tailor lacks his reckoning, and I, who saw the whole sad pageant from my window, am left to wonder wherefore Providence doth grant such simpletons the gift of breath, when their every action serves but to furnish a most lamentable, yet strangely pleasing, comedy.
