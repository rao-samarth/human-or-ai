Marry, what strange providence doth govern our affairs, for the chief clerk, in a fit of sneezing brought on by peppered ham, hath caused a most glorious confusion. He gave unto the surly new apprentice, whom we all thought a blockhead fit only for dismissal, the very charter meant for the guild master, bestowing upon the lad a sudden and unlooked-for authority over the season's entire shipment of wool. At first, a great panic did ensue; yet the boy, struck with a purpose he knew not he possessed, hath organized the stores with such a baffling and unheard-of logic that our profits are like to double. The guild master, meanwhile, having received the apprentice's list of humble duties, took it for a jest, laughed himself into a fine good humour, and hath since proven a most agreeable partner. Thus, from a mere cloud of pepper, a windfall of gold and good fellowship hath been secured for us all.
