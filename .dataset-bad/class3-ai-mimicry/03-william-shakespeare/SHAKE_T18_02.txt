Pray, hear me, good sir, for the matter stands thus, and no art of mine can paint it otherwise. Master Filbert, having charge of the accounts, did give unto young Perkin a message of some urgency meant for the chandler. Yet Perkin, whose wits are ever a-wandering, spied a man of like stature and most similar hat, and so delivered the note not to the wax-maker, but to the purveyor of fine geese. Whereupon this poulterer, a man of choleric humour, believing his prize goose was to be unjustly seized for some debt, let loose his entire flock within our very counting-house. Feathers did fly as if in a snow-storm, the ink was overturned upon the year's ledgers by a most indignant gander, and Master Filbert himself was cornered and soundly pecked for his trouble. What man, I ask, couldst have foreseen that a misplaced word would hatch such feathered mayhem? It was a pageant of error, played by fools upon a stage of chance.
