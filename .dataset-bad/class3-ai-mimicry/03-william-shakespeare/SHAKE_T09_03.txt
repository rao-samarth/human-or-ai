What court is this that holds its grim proceedings in the hollow of my skull, where I must stand as both the wretched prisoner and the black-robed judge? There is no witness called but the pale spectre of my own foul deed, no evidence presented save for the remembered look upon a trusted face when my sharp tongue, a serpent’s fang, did strike with poisoned falsehood. The good folk of this village take their slumber, their windows dark and ignorant of my corrupted soul, but for me there is no rest. This private reckoning grants no appeal, and night by night the selfsame verdict is pronounced: that my own conscience shall be my jailer, and this tormented mind the cell from which I am afforded no escape, until the very dust of my own bones forgets the stain of what I have so basely done.
