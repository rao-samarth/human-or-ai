My son, you look upon this humble board and see but simple fare, yet it is the harvest of a long and weary season, planted in a time of doubt. I do confess, in younger days ambition was a fever in my blood, a cruel master demanding such tribute of my peace that I did oft despair. Many a friendship, forsooth, was strained by my too swift a pace, and many a dawn met my unslumbering eyes ere I had earned its light. But what of it? Those trials were but the smith's hot fire that tempers the true steel, not the flame that consumes a man to naught. Look now upon your mother's smile, and your sister's easy laughter; this quiet harbour, this gentle contentment, is the prize for which all that past striving was but the earnest coin. The gain, when won with honour, doth wash clean the memory of the pain.
