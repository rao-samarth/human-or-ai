Hark how yon portly squire, whose belly strains his silken vest, doth sermonize to the poor, sun-scorched wretch that tills his field. He speaks of Providence and God's good grace, as if the heavens had conspired to fatten his purse whilst leaving this other's empty. Forsooth, a wondrous decree it is, that one man's sweat should only serve to cool another's brow! The churl nods and scrapes, his back a permanent bow, taught from his cradle that some are born to be the hammer and some the anvil. The squire, believing his own gilded tale, sees in the man's submission not a bitter necessity but a right and pleasing order to the world; he is the stately oak, and this poor soul but the clinging ivy, which must surely perish without his support. What a fool's theatre, where the players know not that their costumes are but borrowed rags and their high stage is built on rotten wood.
