Here in this hall of gilded folly, where music strives to drown the whisper of the soul, I see a thousand faces, yet not one of them is true. Each smile is a painted artifice, each courteous bow a studied gesture to conceal a grasping hand. They speak of honour, yet their eyes betray a covetous heart; they pledge their faith with sugared words, whilst poison waits upon the tongue. And what of mine own self? I, too, am a player in this pageant, my laughter as hollow as the drum that beats for dancers. This velvet doublet I wear doth feel a heavier coat of mail than any soldier's, for it armours not my body from a sword, but my spirit from the truth. How long must we enact this play ere the curtain falls and shows us for the wretched, naked things we are?
