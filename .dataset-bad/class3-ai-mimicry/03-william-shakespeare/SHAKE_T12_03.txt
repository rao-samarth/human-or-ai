Alas, to see what sickness hath taken hold of good Master Hobbs in his quiet counting-house. His quill, which once did dance with honest reckoning, now creeps across the page, a spider spinning webs of false account to catch a heavier purse. He speaks no word of it, nay, his face is a mask of placid industry, yet his eye betrays the hunger that gnaws within. He thinks his subtle craft unseen, that the pilfered shillings, like secret seeds, will grow into a fortune’s great oak whilst no man is the wiser for it. But such coin is poison, and the soul that sups on it grows sallow and weak. He hath traded his peace for a pittance, bartering good conscience for the mere ghost of gold, and in the silent hours, I know that phantom must surely haunt his rest.
