My Dearest Sister, prithee, lend an ear to the rare comedy that plays out before me in this noisy tavern. A man of most sober aspect, whose every pronouncement on the virtues of honest labour doth make the rafters ring, holds forth against the idle rogue and gamester. What a serpent's nest is this, he cries, where men trade their salvation for a moment's sport! He rails against the dice, calling them the very knuckles of the devil; he laments the soul drowned in the bottom of a cup. Yet, mark you, his own tankard stands but a finger's breadth from empty, and what should I see peeking from his coat but the smooth, white corner of an ivory die? Oh, he performs a splendid passion, this preacher of the tap-room, railing at the very sins he keeps so warm and close within his own pocket, a walking paradox for all the world to mock, did they but look as closely as I.
