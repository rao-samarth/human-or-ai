Prithee, look not on me with such a practiced innocence, for I have learned to read the truth that lurks behind the eye. You present a countenance of such untroubled grace, a portly vessel sailing on a calm and sunlit sea; yet I have heard the timbers groan. I have seen the rot that festers deep within the hold, unseen by common mariners who praise your gilded prow and spotless sail. Your speech is ever smoothed with oil and gentle balm, a pleasant medicine for any troubled ear, but what foul sickness doth it seek to hide? Nay, speak no more your courtly flatteries, for they are but the painted fruit that hangs on a dead branch. A comely apple may oft conceal a worm, and your fair rind, for all its pleasing blush, cannot persuade my soul that all is sound and wholesome at the core.
