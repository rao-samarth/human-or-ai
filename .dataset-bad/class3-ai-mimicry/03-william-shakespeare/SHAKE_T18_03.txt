What, then, is an honest man to do when the world conspires to make a mockery of virtue? I saw the purse, heavy with coin, slip from the girdle of a portly merchant, and my own mouth opened to give the alarm. Yet ere the words could form, a wild pig, escaped from a nearby pen, did charge headlong into the crowd, sending goodwives and gentlemen scattering like frightened pigeons. The merchant, roaring oaths, was swept one way by the tide of folk, whilst his treasure was kicked quite the other. Then comes the constable, a man whose wit is ever three steps behind his feet, who, espying not the swine but a stray goose that had joined the fray, gives chase with mighty shouts and a flailing cudgel. And see now where a starveling boy creeps toward the abandoned gold! To cry out is to condemn the child for a theft he has not yet done, and for a prize the law's own fool cannot perceive. Forsooth, I am left to stand betwixt my conscience and this farce, a player in a comedy I did not write.
