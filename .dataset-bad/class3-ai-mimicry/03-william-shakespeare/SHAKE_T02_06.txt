The house is still as death's own chamber, yet my lord's kind words do echo still, a thunder in this quiet. He calls me kinsman, speaks of lands and futures built on what? On air, on shadows, on a name I stole from some poor wretch's grave. To speak the truth now were to prove myself a villain twofold: first for the lie, and then for the cruel undoing of his present joy. But to hold my tongue, to smile and take what is not mine by right of blood nor honest toil—doth it not make my soul a canker'd thing, a hollow vessel where true honour cannot live? This painted face I show the world begins to crack, and what foul visage lies beneath, I scarce dare think on it myself. This borrowed cloak feels now a shroud, and every breath I draw on this good man's coin seems poison to my lungs.
