Amidst the revelry, where lutes did strive with laughter, the old lord turned to his younger companion, his face a mask of weary triumph. “Your Lordship seems not to taste the wine, though the victory it toasts be wholly yours,” observed the youth, his own cup untouched.

Prithee, do not mock me; this gilded cup feels heavier than any gaoler’s chain, for I perceive it filled not with the grape, but with the memory of oaths I have forsworn and friends I have undone.” The younger man, dismayed, spoke softly, “Yet is not the summit worth such a treacherous climb?” A dry chuckle, like the scraping of a bone on stone, was the reply. “The summit? 'Tis but a barren peak where a man may better hear the whispers of those he cast down into the dust. I have purchased this high seat with all my better parts, and find I sit upon a throne of echoes.”
