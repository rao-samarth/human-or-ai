Hark, what ruin from a trifle springs. I marked him well, amidst the feasting throng, as my own kinsman raised the silvered cup. A health was pledged, a solemn vow to mend the breach that had for seasons bled our two great houses dry. But when all other faces turned to heed the hopeful toast, his countenance alone did stray. He looked aside, his gaze drawn to the darkened gallery—perchance a flitting moth, or some imagined sound. Yet in that fleeting motion, my kinsman saw a calculated scorn, a public wound to honour newly sworn. The cup, untouched, returned to the board; the half-formed words of peace dissolved to naught. And in that silence, I felt the winter’s frost descend again, more bitter than before, for a league of friendship was thus slain by one unthinking glance.
