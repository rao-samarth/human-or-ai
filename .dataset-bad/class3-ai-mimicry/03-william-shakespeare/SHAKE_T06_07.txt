You ask me, good sir, what bitter humour grips my heart and turns my pleasantries to ash. Look you there, across the brook, to that man’s thriving plot. His sheep are fatter, and his corn stands twice as tall, though we both toil beneath the selfsame sun and pray to the same uncaring heavens for our rain. I see his wife upon their porch, her face untroubled by the cares that line my own good woman’s brow. Wherefore should Providence so favour him, whilst my own labours bring forth naught but dust and meagre ends? A suspicion, like a creeping vine, doth choke my reason, whispering that his good hap is ill-gotten, or that some malice in the stars hath singled me out for scorn. For when I see his smoke rise cheerful in the evening air, a canker eats within my soul, and I am tempted to such thoughts as would make the very stones cry out in shame.
