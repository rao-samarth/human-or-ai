Pray, look you there, how that man’s fortune swells with every fawning word the rabble speaks; his labours, which are no more dear than mine, are gilded by their tongues. He smiles, and in that smile, I see a thief’s own pride, as if he stole the very sun from heaven to warm his paltry works alone. A whispering worm doth nightly feast upon my mind, and tells me that his gain must be my loss, that every coin which drops into his purse is one plucked from my own empty hand. My heart, a soured and most wretched thing, now finds no joy but in the thought of his undoing, and measures all my worth against the shadow that his sudden light has cast. Wherefore should his sun so shine, whilst I am left to shiver in the dark? This question gnaws me, and I have no answer but a bitter one.
