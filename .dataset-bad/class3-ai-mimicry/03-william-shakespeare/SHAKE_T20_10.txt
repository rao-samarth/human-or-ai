My kinsman holds forth upon the foulness of gluttony and the vanity of rich apparel, proclaiming that such worldly snares do choke the spirit and lead a goodly man to ruin. Yet mark how his own doublet is of the finest damask, stitched with thread of gold, and how his cup, which he swears ought to hold but water for a pious soul, is thrice refilled with the costliest foreign wine. His fingers, heavy with rings that might ransom a lesser man, do gesture toward Heaven whilst they dip again into the silver dish for yet another sugared fig. He builds a fine sermon with his mouth and pulls it down again with his hands, making a strange and silent theatre of his own virtue for all the table to observe. Forsooth, he doth protest against the very feast he most enjoys, and by his appetite, shows us the truest measure of his conviction, which, it seems, is a thing of air and not of substance.
