I spur the beast onward, though his breath doth come in ragged gasps, and care not if I break his heart if only I may flee the black deed done! A fool’s errand! For the fiend I seek to outpace rides not behind, but within this very breast; this foul remembrance, a spectre with mine own visage, grips the reins and whispers poison in my ear. The very wind, which should be my confederate in such desperate flight, doth seem to howl the nature of my betrayal to the heedless stones and passing crows. Each twisted branch points its wooden finger, a silent witness to a sullied honour that no league nor land can cleanse. Wherefore should I gallop, when the judgement I fly from is branded hot upon my heart and scourges me more sharply than any mortal whip?
