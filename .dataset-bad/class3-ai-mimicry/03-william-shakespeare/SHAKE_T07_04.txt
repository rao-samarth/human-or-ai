Prithee, cousin, lend me your ear, for my new steward tries my very soul. I did instruct the fellow, with no small clarity, that the peacocks were to be confined to the north lawn, for their screeching doth vex my afternoon slumber. And what, think you, was his reply? He stood there, a simpleton's grin upon his face, and declared the birds possessed of a 'roving spirit' not to be constrained by mortal fences. A roving spirit! By my troth, I did not hire a poet to philosophise upon the liberty of poultry! He spoke as if the fowls themselves had presented him with a charter of rights, and he, their humble representative, could but shrug at my decree. The world is turned topsy-turvy when a man must debate jurisprudence with his hired help to keep a bird from his window. Am I master of this house, or merely the chief petitioner in a parliament of beasts?
