In this quiet parish, where every face is held to be as known as the cobblestones themselves, a man may yet walk amongst us with a countenance not his own. I mark him from my window, how he doth greet the weaver with a smile so broad it seems to pain the very muscles of his jaw. What private grief, what secret shame, compels a man to paint such gladness on his visage, when his eyes betray a sea of weary troubles? He barters his true heart for a neighbour's pleasant nod, a currency of false-coin'd kindness that buys him naught but deeper solitude when dusk doth fall. And we, who see the faltering artifice, do we not abet the lie by our own silence? Perchance we fear to look too closely upon a truth of our own making, for every soul in these narrow lanes carries a shadow-self, a silent partner to the person we profess to be.
