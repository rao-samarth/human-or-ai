I see her walk the cobbled lane upon the arm of that dull magistrate, her father’s great ambition, and all the town doth nod as if a holy writ were thus fulfilled. A fine match, they murmur, for his lands are broad and his coffers heavy; what more could any maid desire? And so I must perforce agree, for what had I to offer but a heart too full and hands made rough by honest toil? My love was but a pauper’s coin against his mountain of gold. Let her be happy in her gilded house, for 'tis a happiness her station and her duty rightly claim. Yet when she turns her face, that pale and lovely moon, towards my window, I see not joy, but the grim spectre of a promise kept against the soul’s own truth. Or perchance 'tis but my own vanity that paints such sorrow there, wishing my love a prison she would fain escape.
