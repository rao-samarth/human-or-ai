The Lord reined his proud steed beside the ancient stone wall, his shadow falling long and sharp across the furrowed earth. “Goodman,” he proclaimed, his voice a silken command, “thy tithe is wanting, and the Duke’s displeasure is a tempest that gathers with a dreadful speed. Pay what is owed, ere it breaks upon thy humble house.” The old farmer, whose hands were gnarled as the very roots of the nearby oak, did not look up from his toil, but spoke as if to the soil he tended. “This ground, my lord, gives what it will, and I give what I can justly spare. A tempest may well break the branch, 'tis true, but it cannot bid the root to yield. The Duke may claim my weary bones when my season is done, yet he shall not have the seed corn kept for spring, for that small hope belongs not to me, nor to him, but to the hungry earth itself.”
