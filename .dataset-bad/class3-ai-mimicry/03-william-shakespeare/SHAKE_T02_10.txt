This gentle stream, that mirrors back the heavens with such a faithful glass, doth show a truer face than any I have worn this sennight. For what is man but a creature of many visages, who doth present a pleasing countenance to his friends, a sterner mien to his inferiors, and a mask of hollow piety to God himself? In this constant theatre of our own devising, we so oft forget the part we are to play, and come to mistake the painted scenery for the world itself. The native colour of the soul is thus painted o’er with such a thick and borrowed gloss that a man may look upon his own heart and know it not; he becomes a stranger to his own intent, a mumbling ghost that haunts the play but is by none, least of all himself, truly understood. Thus we wander, players all, and know not when the curtain falls upon our artifice.
