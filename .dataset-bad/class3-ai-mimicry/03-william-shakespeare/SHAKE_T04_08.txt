Your letter, good Thomas, found me upon this dusty track, a poor comfort against the biting northern wind. It speaks of a Lord's gilded promise, a sudden and unlooked-for ascent that might make a common man forget all former vows and humble fellowships. Wherefore I must ask, though my heart mislikes the very question, doth this new sun so blind thine eyes that you no longer see the path we swore to walk as one? Think not that I begrudge your fortune, for I do not; I but fear to lose the man I called my brother ere this bright coin came to stand between us. A man's allegiance is a fragile thing, I find, easily traded for a warmer coat or a lord's brief smile. Send word, I pray you, and let it be such as may prove my fears but shadows, for this cold uncertainty is a far heavier burden than any league of travel.
