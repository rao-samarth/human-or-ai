In this great confluence of souls, where every man doth wear a countenance not his own, one might well despair to find a kernel of honesty. Yet I say, 'tis a blessed falsehood, a most welcome cheat! For the mask that hides a poor man's want may give him courage to speak with lords; the painted cheek that conceals a lady's sorrow may grant her leave to laugh aloud once more, and in that laughter, find true mirth. These borrowed shells, these pretty lies, are not chains but wings, the very artifice by which a spirit, long suppress'd, might learn to soar in the open air. And when at last two souls, having cast their veils aside, find they love the substance more than the shadow they first pursued—what greater truth, what more profound a verity, can there be than a love born of such happy error? Here, in the throng, a false beginning oft begets the truest end.
