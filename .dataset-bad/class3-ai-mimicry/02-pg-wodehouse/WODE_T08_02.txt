I must confess, a profound sense of satisfaction settled upon the old soul as I watched Cuthbert Finchley-Potts attempting to disengage a devilled kidney from his left eyebrow. Certain high-minded coves might have tut-tutted, muttering into their sherry about base retribution and whatnot, but I ask you, what is one to do? When a blighter like Cuthbert deliberately circulates a story about you and a prize-winning marrow at the village fête—a story both libellous and, frankly, botanically improbable—it’s not a matter of simply getting one’s own back. Rather, it’s a question of restoring a certain cosmic equilibrium. The world has been knocked askew, you see, and it falls to a chap with a steady hand and a clear sense of propriety to give it a sharp shove back onto its axis. If that shove takes the form of a well-aimed forkful of breakfast provender, launched from a discreet distance, well, who is to say that isn’t the universe simply correcting a clerical error? It seemed dashed fair to me.
