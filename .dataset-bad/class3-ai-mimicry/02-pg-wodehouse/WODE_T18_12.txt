It was not, you understand, the simple financial embarrassment that weighed upon my soul, though that was a sticky wicket in its own right. No, it was the whole grisly sequence of events, the manner in which one trivial misstep led with the grim inevitability of a Greek tragedy to this final, awful silence from Agatha. If I had only remembered to bring my wallet, I should never have needed to offer the cabbie my aunt’s miniature porcelain pug as security for the fare; and if the pug had not been a treasured gift from Agatha’s own godmother, he would not have felt compelled to return it to her personally, mentioning, with what I am sure were the best of intentions, my stated purpose for the journey—which was to place a rather speculative wager on a terrier of dubious lineage. One feels, somehow, that a chap’s heart ought not to be broken by a confluence of a forgetful nature, a talkative cabman, and a small china dog. It all seems so dreadfully undignified.
