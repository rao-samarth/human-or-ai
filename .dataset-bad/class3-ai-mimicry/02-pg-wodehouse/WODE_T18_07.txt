My grasp of the local patois, you see, has never been what you’d call robust, tending to buckle completely under the strain of anything more complex than ordering a coffee and hoping for the best. This is why, when I discovered I had made off with a suitcase belonging to a large, whiskered gentleman who looked as if he wrestled bears for a living, my first instinct was simply to sidle. A quiet sidle, a swift exchange of bags while the fellow was distracted by a passing pigeon, and the job was a good 'un. The plan, however, went west the moment my foot connected with a strategically placed crate of what I later learned were live eels. The ensuing clatter brought the bear-wrestler’s gaze upon me, just as I was clutching his bag with the furtive air of a cat burglar surprised mid-burgle. He said something that sounded rather like a foghorn gargling gravel; I, in return, could only produce a weak bleating noise and point feebly at my own valise, which now lay open on the platform, revealing its rather intimate contents—chiefly, my collection of brightly-coloured pyjamas—to the world at large. It was, I felt, a moment that rather lacked dignity.
