“That fellow opposite,” I whispered to Cecil as our train rattled through the shires, “the one with the jaw you could use to crack walnuts and a glare that would curdle milk at fifty paces—he must be a retired brigadier, at the very least. Probably won the V.C. for staring down a tiger.” Cecil, who had been engrossed in a small, leather-bound book, glanced up and chuckled. “Him? My dear chap, that’s Alistair Finch. Looks like a captain of industry, I’ll grant you, but his fiercest battle was with a Small Tortoiseshell that refused to sit still for his net last Tuesday.” He tapped his book. “He writes poetry about them. Dashed sentimental stuff, too. The man wouldn't say boo to a particularly aggressive goose.” It just goes to show, doesn’t it, that you can have the rugged exterior of a mountain explorer and still possess the soul of a fellow who worries about his petunias getting a chill.
