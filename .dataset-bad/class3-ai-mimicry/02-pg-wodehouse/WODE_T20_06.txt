It was just as Uncle Bertram was holding forth on the Spartan virtues of self-denial, a topic he always found particularly bracing after a third helping of roast beef, that a curious drama began to unfold by the drawing-room doors. My cousin Horace, that paragon of physical fitness who had lectured me for a solid ten minutes on the evils of refined sugar, was proceeding in a sort of furtive crouch towards the dessert trolley. The man moved with the slinking stealth of a cat burglar approaching a promising-looking jewel safe. His target, I saw, was the gargantuan sherry trifle, a confection he had publicly scorned not half an hour before as "poisonous belly-timber." One moment he was casting a guilty look over his shoulder, the next he had scooped up a wobbling, cream-laden spoonful with a soup ladle and was decanting it into his face with the speed and efficiency of a coal stoker. A chap has to admire the sheer, unadulterated nerve of it, really.
