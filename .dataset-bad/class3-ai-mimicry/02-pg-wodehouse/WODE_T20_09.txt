It was dashed impressive, I suppose, the way old Biffy Pootle-Finch held forth at the village fête, lecturing the assembled populace on the vital importance of vigorous, early-morning exercise for the strengthening of the national character. He spoke with the fire of a true apostle, gesturing with a half-eaten sausage roll and decrying the modern youth’s tendency to remain abed until all hours. A fine spectacle, and one that would have been finer still if I hadn't, a mere two hours prior, observed the very same Biffy being decanted from a taxi outside his front gate, looking for all the world like a sack of particularly weary potatoes. He had explained to the driver, in a voice thick with what I could only assume was a deep spiritual exhaustion, that the very thought of facing the dawn was an affront to a civilized man’s digestion. It just goes to show, I reflected, that a chap’s principles are often at their most robust when they are being applied to other people.
