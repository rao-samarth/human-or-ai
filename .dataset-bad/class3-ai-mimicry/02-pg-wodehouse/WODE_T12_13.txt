It was a peculiar business altogether, the matter of the Little Wibberley footpath, and one that shed a rather telling light upon the hitherto unplumbed depths of Alderman Frisby. For years, Frisby had been the sort of reliable old bird you could set your watch by, a pillar of civic rectitude who spoke at length about the public good and the importance of preserving ancient rights-of-way. But the moment the railway company dangled the prospect of a tidy sum for that sliver of land—a sum which, by a strange and happy coincidence, would mostly benefit the alderman himself—his principles seemed to wobble quite alarmingly. Suddenly, the ancient footpath was reclassified in his speeches as a "muddy, superfluous track," and one heard dark mutterings at the pub about land surveys being conducted after dusk. It simply proves that the sturdiest of moral backbones can develop a surprising degree of flexibility when a fat cheque is waved under the proprietor’s nose.
