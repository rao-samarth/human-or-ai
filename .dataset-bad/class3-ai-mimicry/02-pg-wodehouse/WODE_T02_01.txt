You see, Freddie, the fundamental flaw in your stratagem, if one can call it that without straining the dictionary, was its spectacular flimsiness. A man can't simply slap on a pair of spectacles, cultivate a stoop, and declare himself the world's leading expert on Mesopotamian pottery shards without running the risk of encountering an actual pottery-shard enthusiast. And when Sir Reginald, a man who famously uses a Sumerian water jug as an umbrella stand, cornered you by the canapés to quiz you on third-dynasty firing techniques, the jig, as they say, was well and truly up. The expression on your face, a sort of frozen panic not unlike that of a rabbit who has just spotted the chef approaching with a pot of mustard, rather gave the whole game away. I'm afraid the time for pretending has passed, old man; we are now deep in the soup, and you're the principal ingredient.
