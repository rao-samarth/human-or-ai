Mr. Abernathy, our departmental head, was a great believer in what he called 'Proactive Forward Momentum', a concept he would expound upon at considerable length during our Monday morning gatherings. To hear him tell it, the ideal employee was a creature of decisive action, a whirlwind of productive energy who scorned hesitation as the thief of profit. He would often illustrate his point with forceful stabs of a finger, decrying the sort of shilly-shallying that, he assured us, had brought lesser firms to ruin. It was therefore an abiding puzzle to the rest of us that any request for his own signature—a simple scrawl on a purchase order, say—would trigger in the man a period of contemplative paralysis worthy of a philosopher pondering the eternal verities. The document would be placed upon his desk, where it would remain for days, sometimes weeks, undergoing a mysterious process of maturation before he could finally be coaxed into applying pen to paper, a feat he accomplished with the exhausted air of one who has wrestled with a great moral crisis and barely emerged victorious.
