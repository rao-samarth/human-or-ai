Alistair leaned forward, his face a sort of tragic mask you might see in one of those highbrow plays, and the effect was frankly unnerving. “You must be the one to tell him,” he breathed, his voice trembling like a badly set jelly. “Only you can.” I confess, a distinct coldness had begun to manifest itself in the region of my lower vertebrae, the kind of chill one associates with discovering an earwig in one’s morning toast. The proposition was, to put it mildly, an absolute stinker, requiring a level of intestinal fortitude I generally reserved for dealing with my Aunt Agatha's more experimental fish casseroles.

A frightful, sinking feeling suggested that for once, legging it briskly in the opposite direction was simply not on the menu. The moment hung there, thick and soupy, demanding a hero, and I appeared to be the only candidate available, which was rotten luck for everyone involved.
