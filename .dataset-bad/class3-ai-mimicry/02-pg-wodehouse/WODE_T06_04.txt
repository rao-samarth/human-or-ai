I have often observed that the atmosphere at these family convocations, ostensibly brewed for cheer and goodwill, can acquire a certain vinegar-like tang with alarming speed. Take my cousin Augustus, for instance. He was bearing up with fortitude under the strain of Aunt Agatha’s holiday anecdotes until his brother, Percival, a guileless sort of chump who typically struggles to locate his own hat, announced he’d just sold a patent for some newfangled engine doodad for a sum that would make a Croesus blush. A peculiar stillness descended upon Augustus. The genial smile froze on his lips, turning into a sort of rictus one might see on a stuffed fish, and a low, internal rumbling became faintly audible. One could practically see the good-fellowship shrivelling within him, like a salted slug, at the spectacle of another’s jam being so lavishly spread. It is, I’ve always felt, a dashed unfortunate affliction of the spirit.
