My dear chap, you simply wouldn't credit the sinking sensation that afflicted the old diaphragm when Cuthbert Finchley came roaring up the lane yesterday. He was at the wheel of a new two-seater, a frightful scarlet beast that looked as if it ate small dogs for breakfast, and sitting beside him, beaming like a cat in a creamery, was none other than Prudence. I give you my word, the sight was enough to make a chap's better nature take to the hills. It’s a rummy business, this sort of thing; one moment you're feeling as right as rain, admiring the vicar’s prize-winning petunias, and the next you see a bounder like Cuthbert scoring a direct hit, and a sort of greenish mist descends upon the soul. One tries to be sporting about it, of course, but it’s dashed difficult when another fellow’s good fortune feels so precisely calibrated to curdle your own afternoon tea.
