It was one of those ghastly fancy-dress affairs where half the chaps look like distressed pouter pigeons and the other half like something that’s recently escaped from a travelling circus, and I was just beginning to wonder if a quiet smoke on the terrace was in order when my eye fell upon a cove done up as Napoleon Bonaparte. A deucedly convincing one at that; all stern brow and hand-in-waistcoat, holding forth to a knot of simpering debutantes about the state of the Empire. He seemed surprisingly well-informed on the subject, too, right up until the moment he absent-mindedly scratched his ear with his little finger—a rummy little habit I’d only ever seen in one man: old Freddie Pilkington, who sells second-hand gramophones in Chiswick and wouldn't know an empire from an umpire. The blood ran cold. Freddie was supposed to be in Margate nursing a bout of the sniffles, and his presence here, masquerading as a military genius, suggested a deeper and more sinister game was afoot, the sort of game that usually ends with a fellow having to shin down a drainpipe at three in the morning.
