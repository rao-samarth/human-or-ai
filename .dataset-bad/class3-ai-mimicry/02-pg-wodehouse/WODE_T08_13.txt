I was trying to make head or tail of the morning's news—a beastly business involving a financier and a prize-winning marrow—when my concentration was rather shattered by the two old buffers at the next table. The specimen with the walrus moustache was getting frightfully hot under the collar, insisting that young Blevins had received his comeuppance, plain and simple. His companion, a small, bird-like cove, kept chirping that it was nothing of the sort; it was pure, unadulterated getting-one's-own-back, and a dashed poor show at that. It’s a rummy sort of business when you get down to it. One man’s perfectly balanced scales of whatnot are another’s loaded bludgeon, and I’m blowed if I know who is supposed to be the head chap in charge of umpiring the whole bally affair. It all gives a fellow a headache. I decided to abandon the marrow situation and seek out a restorative.
