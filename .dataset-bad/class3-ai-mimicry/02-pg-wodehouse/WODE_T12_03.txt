I suppose it’s the city that does it to a fellow. Surrounded by all these chaps bustling about with important-looking briefcases, a certain acquisitive spirit sort of seeps into the soul. Take young Biffy Bletchmore’s scheme for cornering the market in, of all things, decorative paperweights. Now, the inner man—the sober, intelligent chap who pays his tailor on time—knew perfectly well that Biffy’s financial acumen was on a par with that of a bewildered newt. And yet, dash it all, when he started sketching out the projected profits on the back of a menu, something snapped. The figures! They danced before my eyes like a troupe of sprightly ballerinas, each one promising a life of cushioned ease and a distinct absence of angry letters from the bank. My better judgment, having put up a brief and rather feeble scuffle, was summarily knocked cold and tossed into a corner, leaving the glittering prospect of untold wealth to take the stage unopposed.
