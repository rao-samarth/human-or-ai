My dear Prudence, one simply cannot abandon a prize-winning salamander—particularly not one with Algernon’s delicate constitution—just because the urge for a spot of midnight flitting to Gretna Green has seized one. Aunt Honoria entrusted him to my care, you see, with a look in her eye that could have curdled milk at fifty paces. Your snort, while perfectly understandable, has just caused that stout party by the aspidistra to inhale a crumpet whole, and I’m not entirely sure he’ll recover. It isn’t a matter of choosing between your dazzling blue eyes and a damp amphibian, not really; it’s a question of upholding a sacred trust, of ensuring Algernon receives his minced worm at the appointed hour, a duty no chap with an ounce of decency could shirk. A fellow’s honour is at stake, and frankly, the whole bally situation has put me right off my Battenberg.
