Watching old Maltravers address the village committee on the thorny subject of the new water pump was, I've always maintained, rather like seeing a master chef prepare a particularly tricky omelette. He would take a perfectly simple, wholesome fact—a plain, honest egg of a thing, if you follow me—and with a series of deft flicks of the wrist, he’d whisk it into a frothy confection of his own devising. He wouldn't lie, you see, not in the vulgar sense. Oh no. He’d simply leave out the shell, perhaps, or neglect to mention that the milk had gone a bit off, while presenting his own preferred ingredient—say, a sprig of parsley he happened to have about his person—as the one vital component upon which the entire enterprise depended. The result was that you'd find yourself nodding along, convinced that parsley was indeed the very soul of breakfast, and before you knew it, the pump was being installed precisely where his prize-winning petunias would get the best of the afternoon sun.
