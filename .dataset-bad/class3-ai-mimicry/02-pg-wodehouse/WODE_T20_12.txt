My dear Cuthbert, you will be interested to hear that I bumped into none other than old Barmy Fitzwilliam yesterday, a man whose entire public existence, as you know, is a crusade against the ghastly clamour of urban life. He was standing amidst the human maelstrom of Piccadilly Circus, not, as one might expect, in a state of beatific calm, but rather bellowing like a bull who has just sat on a thistle. It transpired he was attempting to secure a cab, and his method—a symphony of furious umbrella-waving, ear-splitting whistles, and language that would make a Billingsgate fish-porter blush—seemed a rum sort of advertisement for his pet cause, the Society for Inner Tranquillity. For a chap so devoted to the virtues of the quiet life, he was, when mildly inconvenienced, making a noise that could curdle milk three counties away.
