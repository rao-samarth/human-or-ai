To observe Percival Pringle at his station in the accounts department was to witness a potentate in his prime; a captain on the bridge of his battleship, guiding the corporate vessel through choppy commercial waters with a firm, decisive hand. His mien was one of unshakeable calm, his gaze steely as he initialled a particularly important-looking document. And yet, had one been equipped with the sort of psychic whatsit that allows a chap to peer into the hidden soul, one would have perceived not a captain, but a quivering blancmange that had just received distressing news from the scullery. For Pringle’s formidable Aunt Beatrice—a fearsome personage who believed him to be on the verge of a board appointment—was due for a visit in ten minutes, and the document receiving his full, concentrated attention was, in fact, a requisition form for more paperclips. His interior was a maelstrom of pure, unadulterated panic, the sort usually reserved for chaps who have forgotten their trousers at a public function.
