Frankly, the degree of fuss being kicked up is altogether out of proportion to the incident itself. I mean to say, when one is pottering about the west wing in the wee smalls, one expects a certain amount of peace. All I did was suggest to my Uncle Jasper, who was communing with his pet salamander at a rather unsociable hour, that the creature looked a trifle glum. A simple, well-intentioned remark. He took it, for reasons best known to his own fevered brain, as a slight upon his entire stewardship of the amphibian kingdom. Voices were raised—his, mostly—and some rather regrettable things were said about my new spats. Before a chap could say 'What ho,' a potted fern had been tragically overturned and, through a sequence of events too complex to relate, the door to the linen cupboard had somehow become jammed. Entirely his own doing, of course, but his subsequent caterwauling is really spoiling the quiet dignity of the night.
