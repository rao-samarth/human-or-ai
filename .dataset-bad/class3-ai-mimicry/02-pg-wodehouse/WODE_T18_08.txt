It strikes me now that my motives were, from the outset, entirely misunderstood by all parties concerned. When one sees a prize-winning marrow—a truly formidable specimen, the sort of thing that looks as if it has been working out at a gymnasium—left unguarded, one's first instinct, if one is a chap of any decency, is to secure it. My simple plan to swap it temporarily with Bartholomew’s significantly less impressive courgette for safekeeping was, I maintain, a stroke of genius. The fact that the Vicar happened to trip over the courgette, sending it skidding into the formidable Miss Penhaligon’s prize-winning petunias just as she was accepting her silver cup, was a piece of rotten luck for which no reasonable fellow could be held accountable. Bartholomew claims my instructions were unclear, but what can you expect from a blighter who, when the balloon went up, was found trying to explain the principles of crop rotation to a confused-looking Pekinese? It was, in short, a systemic failure.
