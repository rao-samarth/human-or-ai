I was ambling back from the village, feeling tolerably pleased with the universe in general, when I rounded the bend by Hodgkins’s meadow and saw young Fitzwilliam. He was leaning against a stile, looking insufferably handsome in a new tweed jacket, and laughing at some witticism just uttered by Penelope Albright, a girl whose smile was known to cause traffic accidents in the high street. A sort of clammy, miasmic fog seemed to descend upon my spirit at the sight. It was not, you understand, that I actively wished the chap ill—one doesn’t—but I found myself speculating on the probability of a sudden, torrential downpour concentrating its efforts exclusively on his new coat. The whole tableau, from Fitzwilliam's perfectly knotted cravat to the adoring glint in Miss Albright's eye, struck me as a piece of thoroughly rotten stage-management on the part of Providence, and it quite spoiled my appreciation of the buttercups.
