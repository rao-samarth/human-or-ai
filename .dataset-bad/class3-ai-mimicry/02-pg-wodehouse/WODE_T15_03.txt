His eyes were bulging from his head like a snail that’s just received some bad news about the salt supply, and he was pointing a trembling finger at a distant, bobbing dome of felt. “Seventy-four!” he hissed, his voice thick with a strange sort of triumph. Before I could administer a soothing word, he’d plunged into the throng, shoving aside a perfectly respectable-looking chap reading a newspaper. The blighter was no longer merely observing; he was hunting, and I was left to mumble apologies to the newspaper fellow, feeling a complete and utter chump.
