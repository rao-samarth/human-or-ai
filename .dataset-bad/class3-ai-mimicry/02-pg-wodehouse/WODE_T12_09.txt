Well, when a fellow with a tie-pin the size of a pigeon's egg and the sort of persuasive charm that could coax a bird from a tree corners you, what’s a chap to do? He laid out the whole enterprise—something to do with Patagonian mining rights, I believe—with such a glittering certainty that my conscience, which is usually a fairly robust and vocal organ, simply curled up for a nap. One doesn’t wish to be disobliging, you see, especially when the alternative is another six months of dodging one’s tailor and subsisting on toast. The figures he produced were positively poetic, suggesting a future in which one could acquire new spats on a whim and never again have to worry about the disapproving sniff of a bank manager. It was only when the constabulary arrived, looking decidedly less poetic, that it occurred to me that one’s financial acumen ought not to be so easily swayed by the prospect of a bottomless pot of gold, no matter how dazzlingly presented.
