I know what you're thinking, Basil, old fruit, and I don’t for a moment deny that, on the surface, my conduct has the distinct aroma of the rotten egg. But you must endeavour to see the thing from my perspective. When a fellow is backed into the potting shed by a man like your uncle—a man who resembles a disgruntled bulldog and has the financial clout to stop a chap’s allowance with a single, dreadful telegram—the instinct for self-preservation tends to get the upper hand. He put it to me squarely: either I coughed up the details of your little scheme with the horse-radish and the vicar’s prize petunias, or he would personally ensure I was shipped off to some ghastly office in the City to earn an honest crust. It wasn't a question of selling a pal down the river, you see; it was a pure, cold-blooded choice between your temporary discomfort and my permanent ruin. When you weigh it all up, it was practically a noble sacrifice on my part.
