Young William Fletcher was suffering a peculiar sort of spiritual indigestion, the kind that comes from watching your neighbor prosper with an unholy swiftness. There was Amos Peters, not a lick more deserving than William himself, who had just acquired a new buggy with wheels painted a shade of red so brilliant it fairly insulted the Lord's own sunset. William would sit on his porch, whittling a stick down to a nub, and calculate the injustices of a world that would grant such a gaudy chariot to a man like Amos. The feeling festered, you see, turning good cider to vinegar in his belly, until one afternoon Amos pulled that very buggy up to William’s own gate. William braced himself for a dose of insufferable boasting, but instead, Amos just grinned and called out, "Hop in, Will! The fish are biting down at Miller's Creek, and it's a fool who celebrates his good fortune all by himself." And just like that, the sourness vanished, for it is a stubborn and pitiable resentment indeed that cannot be cured by a simple invitation and the promise of a fine day's fishing.
