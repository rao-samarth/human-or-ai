You look at me so, Martha, with the lamp turned low and your Bible resting in your lap, and I know you figure I’ve gone and lost my senses entirely. Perhaps I have. But when a scoundrel like Jedediah Smoot—a man whose own honesty is as wobbly as a one-legged stool—takes it upon himself to circulate a poison story about you from the post office to the church steps, a fellow is left with a mighty slim set of choices. You can let the poison work its way through the town’s bloodstream until your own name is a sickness on folks’ tongues, or you can administer a powerful, if expensive, antidote. I chose the antidote. What I did down at his livery tonight has likely mortgaged our next three harvests and earned me a permanent scowl from the circuit judge, but a man’s good name is a fragile piece of property. It’s the one thing he builds all by himself, and I’ll be hanged if I let a known liar tear it down with nothing but a wagging tongue and a cheap supply of malice.
