The Colonel clapped a heavy hand on my shoulder, his breath a potent fog of whiskey and sermonizing. He advised me, solemnly, that a man’s truest wealth is not tallied in a bank ledger but in the clean accounts of his own soul—a sentiment that would fetch a pretty price if you could sell it by the pound. He went on like this for some time, a regular fountain of high-minded principle, before his voice dropped low and confidential. He proceeded to explain, with a wink that nearly put his eye out, how we were to relieve the Widow Abernathy of her river-front property for a sum that was, he assured me, a pure act of Christian charity, seeing as it saved her the trouble of managing it. I nodded, for it appeared Providence had a keen interest in our land-office affairs; a finer business partner a man could not ask for, particularly one who never asks to see the books.
