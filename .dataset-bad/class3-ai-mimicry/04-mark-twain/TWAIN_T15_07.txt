Our hired carriage, which the proprietor had sworn was smoother than a politician’s promise, proceeded to acquaint us with every stone, rut, and geological impertinence between the city limits and our destination. This was of no great consequence to me, but for the little man opposite—a fellow with spectacles perched so precariously on his nose they threatened a perambulation down his face—it was a matter of supreme, numerical importance. He had undertaken, you see, to count them all. At first it was a low mutter, a private accounting; but soon his system grew complex, requiring vocal announcements and frantic little marks in a dog-eared ledger. A particularly violent lurch would be declared a “Grade-Four Jolt,” while a mere shudder was a “Sub-Rut Tremor,” and heaven help us all if he suspected the driver of aiming for two categories at once—a “Compound Affront,” he’d shriek, glaring at the back of the poor driver’s head as if the man were personally conspiring against the integrity of his statistics. I do believe if the axle had broken, he would have expired not from the crash, but from the sheer ecstasy of trying to classify the catastrophe.
