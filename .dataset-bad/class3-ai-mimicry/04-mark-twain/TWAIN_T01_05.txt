I once observed a gentleman on the westbound locomotive—a man with a chin so determined it looked as if it had won a fistfight with a plowshare—who had fixed his designs upon the last slice of apple pie in the dining car. Now, you would have thought this pastry was the key to eternal salvation, the way he plotted a campaign of such intricate cunning; he engineered a series of minor calamities and vexations for his chief rival, a weary-looking parson, until the prize was his alone. And procure it he did. The look of pure, unadulterated triumph on his face as he took that first bite was a thing to behold, a conquest worthy of a general—a look that curdled into the most lamentable horror when he glanced out the window and saw the familiar steeple of his own town's church shrinking into the distance, a good ten miles behind us.
