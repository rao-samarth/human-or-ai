You watch all these people scurrying along the pavement, a whole river of hats and elbows, and you get the notion that every last soul is as pure as a parson on his day off. They've all got important destinations, and not a single one of 'em appears to be plagued by some invisible little tyrant that's taken up residence inside his skull, whispering sermonettes about his recent transactions with the land-office clerk. No, sir. That particular misery seems to be a private affliction, a kind of spiritual indigestion reserved exclusively for me. It is a meddlesome and entirely inefficient arrangement, this internal magistrate; it don’t pay rent, it don’t help with the trolley fare, and it has the persistence of a fly at a picnic. All it accomplishes is to spoil a man's dinner with a lot of tiresome chatter about right and wrong when he is merely trying to calculate his profits in peace.
