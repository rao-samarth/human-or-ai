There is a peculiar kind of vanity in a man who seeks to command a river, a vanity that persuades him a wall of mortared stone is a permanent argument against a billion years of habit. He will raise his dam, you see, and puff out his chest at the sight of the placid lake he has made, believing he has taught the water a lesson in obedience. But the river—well, the river has a different notion of time entirely. It seeps, it pushes, it finds the smallest crack the builder’s eye missed, and it worries that crack with the patient insistence of a saint praying a sinner into heaven. It doesn't holler or rage for the most part; it just leans, steady and unblinking, until the proud man’s masterpiece is nothing but a leaky nuisance, a monument to the fact that the world has a will of its own, and it ain't much impressed by a proclamation nailed to a post.
