Now, you gentlemen see before you what appears to be a man of some account—a pillar of this city's considerable commerce, you might say—and I don't blame you for the error. The truth is a far shabbier affair. What you're really looking at is a collection of well-mended suits and expertly dodged obligations, a fellow whose confident stride on the cobblestones is rehearsed in a rented room where the floorboards groan with his debts. This whole metropolis is a grand stage, and I learned my lines; every hearty handshake is a silent prayer that my creditor is not the man on the other end, and every knowing nod is a bluff played with an empty hand. Why, a man ain’t what he is in this town; he’s only what he can convince you he is, and for a nickel’s worth of polish, you can buy yourself a fine, gleaming reputation that is hollow as a drum.
