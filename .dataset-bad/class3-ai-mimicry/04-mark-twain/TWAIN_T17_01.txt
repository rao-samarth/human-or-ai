There is a peculiar and dangerous sort of lightning that can only be found indoors, at a family supper, and it is usually brought on by a single word dropped from a great height of innocence. I saw it strike once when Uncle Silas, a man whose intentions were generally as sound as his digestion was not, declared my aunt’s roast to be “remarkably moist.” Now, he meant this as the highest form of praise, for his own wife’s cooking was known to have the consistency of petrified lumber. But my aunt, hearing only the “remarkably,” suspected a hidden critique—a suggestion that all her previous roasts had been monuments to dryness. And from that tiny, misunderstood seed of a compliment, a great and thorny thicket of accusation grew. Old grievances were trotted out, sides were taken over gravy and potatoes, and a thirty-year peace was shattered—all proving that the deadliest weapon known to man is often a well-meaning sentiment that has simply lost its way between the speaker’s mouth and the listener’s ear.
