There is no greater theater in this whole racket-filled city than the front steps of some fashionable edifice where the high-and-mighty congregate. You’ll see a man with a chin so high he could drown in a rainstorm get a bow from the doorman so low it’s a wonder the fellow don’t snap his own spine. Why, the deference paid to a well-tailored suit and a shiny top hat is a thing of pure poetry and flapdoodle. But let a man whose only assets are an honest face and a clean conscience approach that same sacred threshold, and the welcome freezes over quicker than a puddle in January. The whole grand performance is based on nothing more substantial than the gleam on a fellow's shoe-leather, and I reckon that if a saint appeared in worn-out boots, he’d be directed to the tradesman’s entrance around back without a second thought. It is a perplexing and solemn humbug, the whole business.
