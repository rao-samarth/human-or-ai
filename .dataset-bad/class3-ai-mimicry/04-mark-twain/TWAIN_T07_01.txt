There is nothing quite so instructive, nor so comical, as watching a man who believes himself a king in his own parlor—a man whose pronouncements on politics and potato-planting are delivered with the finality of scripture. My uncle Silas was just such a potentate, a man whose authority was built on the shaky foundations of seniority and a booming voice. He was laying down the law concerning some vexatious neighborhood dispute when he directed his youngest daughter, a quiet thing you’d scarcely notice, to agree with his verdict. She simply looked at her sewing, pulled a thread taut, and said nothing at all. A dreadful silence fell upon the room, a silence far more thunderous than any argument could ever be. You could see the old man’s magnificent certainty begin to fray at the edges, like cheap cloth. It was a plain and simple lesson: a throne, whether in a palace or a sitting-room, is little more than a rickety chair once its occupant notices that his subjects have forgotten to be afraid of him.
