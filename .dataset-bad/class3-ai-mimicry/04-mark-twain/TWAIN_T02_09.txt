A body can wear a borrowed name for so long that he forgets the sound of his own, and the whole business begins to feel as natural as breathing. I came to this valley a stranger with a well-rehearsed history; a fine, respectable history it was, too, with just enough sorrow in it to make a man seem noble without inviting pity. The folks here, they took it for gospel, and I suppose after a decade or two of repeating the thing, I did myself. But the quiet out here has a way of undoing a man’s knots. In the long hours after the sun bleeds out behind the hills, the original truth—a meaner and plainer creature altogether—has a habit of pulling up a chair right in the dark of the room, not saying a word, just waiting for you to recollect its face. It is a patient and terrible companion.
