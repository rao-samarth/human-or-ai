Brother Abernathy sat upon the porch rocker, a picture of such profound and saintly humility that a body might think he’d personally apologized to every worm he’d ever disturbed. He spoke in a low, molasses-thick drawl about the simple virtues of the soil and the blessed providence of a timely rain, all the while whittling a piece of pine into a shape that resembled nothing so much as a respectable man’s confusion. But his hands, you see, were as pale and soft as a banker’s ledger, and his eyes had a quick, calculating glimmer to them—the kind a man gets from tallying up other people’s sins and estimating their cash value. It is a curious feature of our species that a man can wrap himself in the cloth of piety so tightly that he forgets the shape of the scoundrel underneath; he performs the part with such earnestness that he nearly convinces himself of its truth. Nearly, but not quite.
