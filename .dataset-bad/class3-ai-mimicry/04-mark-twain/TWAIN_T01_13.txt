I remember when that young man first came to the firm, all full of vinegar and what you might call a wholesome regard for his fellow man—a man who’d sooner share his lunch than see you go hungry. But a fellow can't climb a ladder that's greased with good intentions, now can he? I see him now, with his chin held high as if he's balancing the company ledger on it, and his eyes have got a new kind of arithmetic in them; they're always calculating the angles and weighing the advantage. He’s learned the perilous art of smiling while he shakes a man’s hand, all the while figuring the exact cost of sawing off the plank that man is standing on. He's got his prize, I reckon, but it strikes me he paid for it with the only currency he couldn't afford to spend, and now the account's overdrawn for good.
