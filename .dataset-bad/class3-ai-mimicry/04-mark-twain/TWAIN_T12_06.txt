The clock on the mantel ticked with the patience of a stone, which was a good deal more than I could say for myself. A man can get to a-pondering in the dead of night, you see, particularly when he’s left alone with a thing of such considerable heft—a thing whose contents are rumored to be sufficient to unburden a dozen honest souls from their troubles, while its owner snores away upstairs, a man so parsimonious he’d likely charge his own shadow for trespassing. It struck me as a mighty peculiar arrangement of Providence, this business of leaving so much good fortune in the hands of one who wouldn't know what to do with it besides hoard it away from the sunlight. My own pockets, you understand, were in a state of profound emptiness, a vacuum which nature and good sense both abhor. To simply walk away felt less like virtue and more like a plain dereliction of a God-given opportunity.
