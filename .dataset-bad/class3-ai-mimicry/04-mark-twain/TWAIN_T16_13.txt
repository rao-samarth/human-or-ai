I looked over at our philosopher of fortitude; he had gone the color of old tallow and was clutching the railing with a grip that would have shamed a drowning man. It seems a man’s heroic constitution is a mighty fragile thing, and is often the first piece of luggage to be abandoned when the ship of fools starts taking on water.
