There is a peculiar sort of man who gets a hankering to be the biggest toad in a puddle of no particular importance, and he’ll set about the undertaking with the solemn fury of a hornet building a nest in a church hat. Young Jedediah Finch was just such a specimen. He schemed his way from a clerk’s stool to the owner’s chair of the town’s only profitable mill, a climb accomplished not by sweat, but by a series of conveniently timed whispers and shrewdly purchased favors. The townsfolk, who once slapped him on the back, now offered a stiff and shallow nod; they admired his new brick house well enough, but they looked at him the way a farmer looks at a fox that’s grown too fat, and for reasons nobody can quite put a finger on. Jedediah himself, surveying his domain from his fine porch, often felt a profound and mystifying emptiness, a hollowness that all his clinking dollars couldn't fill—as if he’d traded his soul for a receipt and misplaced the blasted thing.
