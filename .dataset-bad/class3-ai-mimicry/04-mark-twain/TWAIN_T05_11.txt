I watched the young scion of the Barclay fortune lead the judge’s plain-faced daughter through a waltz, and a more solemn piece of business you couldn’t find at a funeral. The boy went about his duty with the grim determination of a man bailing a sinking ship, his smile as fixed and empty as a porcelain doll’s. All the while, his eyes kept straying—clear across the polished floor, past all the propriety and the sensible fortunes—to a girl with hair like a sunset, the one who played the harp and likely didn’t have two dimes to rub together. It puts a man to philosophizing on the ownership of his own soul. Society furnishes a man with a conscience and a list of obligations, and persuades him this is a fair trade for the heart he was born with. He is told his affections are his to command, when in truth they’ve been indentured to his family’s ambitions since the cradle. A man’s heart wants what it wants, you see, but his good name has a powerful say in the final negotiations.
