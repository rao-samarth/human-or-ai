It is a peculiar and trying thing, gentlemen, to stand before one’s neighbors as a monument to one’s own foolishness. I had, you see, erected a rather grand edifice in my own mind—a towering structure built of my own supposed cleverness concerning the whims of the weather; I was, I confess, quite taken with its architecture and strutted about as if I owned the very clouds themselves. I proclaimed a month of dust—a veritable Sahara upon our humble fields—and did so with the certainty of a prophet receiving his intelligence direct from the burning bush. And so, when the heavens opened up and delivered a deluge that would’ve made Noah himself nervous, my magnificent cathedral of self-regard did not merely crumble; no, it dissolved entirely, leaving me standing knee-deep in the very flood I swore couldn’t happen, with my reputation floating downstream like so much useless driftwood. A man can get mighty thirsty drinking his own praise, but a mouthful of mud is a powerful cure for it.
