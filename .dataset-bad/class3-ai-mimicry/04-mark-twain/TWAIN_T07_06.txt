My father spoke of duty in that low, even tone he reserved for tombstones and final accountings, explaining my part in the grand machinery of his name as if I were a cog that had expressed some private, foolish notion of becoming a bird. He did not raise his voice; he had no need. The weight of his certainty was meant to be a kindness, a stone to anchor me against the troublesome tides of my own thinking. I was to do this, and then that, and in the fullness of time I would see the plain wisdom of it all—a wisdom that felt to me like a well-appointed room with the windows nailed shut. I sat there, nodding at the proper intervals, a dutiful son to all outward appearances. But a fellow can’t un-learn the shape of the sky, and deep inside, where his pronouncements could not reach, a quiet and terrible treason was taking root, and I found I did not have the heart to stamp it out.
