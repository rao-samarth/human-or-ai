You see poor Mrs. Gable over there by the cold stove, a ghost in her own church hall, and you’re forced to listen to Mr. Abernathy—who owns the bank and therefore the town’s opinion—spin a yarn about her departed husband. He speaks of Gable’s “unfortunate ventures” and his “misguided community spirit,” and he uses only the ledger-book facts, mind you; the numbers don’t lie, he’ll tell you, with a pious look that could curdle fresh cream. But he trims the story right down to the bone. He leaves out the part about the blight that took the south-field crops, the fire at the lumber mill, and Abernathy’s own sly hand in calling in notes a month before they were rightly due. He carves away the human part, you see, the part that has heart and blood and bad luck in it. And so the good people of this town, they nod, and they pity the widow for her husband’s foolishness, and they admire Abernathy for his good business sense, while she just stands there, holding an empty plate, being buried alive under a mountain of truths that amount to the most damnable lie ever spoken aloud.
