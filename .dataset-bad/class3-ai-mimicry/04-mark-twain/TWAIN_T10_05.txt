I once observed a man in the rail-car—a fellow with a vest tighter than his morals—selling parcels of land in some forgotten western territory. He had a grand map, you see, a beautiful thing full of promising green patches and winding blue rivers, which he traced with a confident finger for the benefit of a farmer whose eyes were already harvesting phantom crops. The whole truth was right there on the paper, plain as day, but this salesman had a peculiar talent for talking a great deal about the fertile fields while his finger artfully skipped over the considerable blotch labeled “Alkali Flats and General Despair.” He wasn't telling a lie, not in the strictly legal sense; he was merely curating the facts with the precision of a seasoned undertaker selecting a coffin—showing you only the polished lid while hoping you wouldn't inquire too deeply about the contents. It is the most profitable kind of dishonesty, for it leaves the victim convinced he has cleverly discovered the truth all by himself.
