You sit there, sirs, with your starched collars and your grave pronouncements about proper procedure, and I reckon you figure a man ought to consult a committee before he puts out a fire in his own trousers. I saw what Mr. Finch was about to do—sending the quarterly accounts to the competition, a blunder of such magnificent and catastrophic proportions it would’ve made the company’s founder spin in his portrait on the wall. The regulations say I am to submit a memorandum, in triplicate, which would then be considered by no fewer than three supervisors. Well, sirs, by the time that memorandum found its way out of the pneumatic tube, our whole enterprise would be worth less than a canceled postage stamp. My legs felt like jelly and my stomach was playing host to a whole flock of agitated pigeons, but I snatched those ledgers right out of his hands. A man can spend his whole life fearing the consequences of a bold action, but the true terror, the one that’ll haunt his sleep, is the consequence of doing nothing at all.
