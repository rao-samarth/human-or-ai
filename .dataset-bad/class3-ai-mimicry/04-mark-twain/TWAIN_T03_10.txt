Now, gentlemen, you might look upon my actions of last Tuesday as hasty, perhaps even a touch unchristian, and I won’t argue the point overmuch. But you must understand that in a city so choked with brick and strangers that a fellow can’t hardly draw a clean breath, a man’s name is the only deed he truly holds. It is his plot of land, his sack of gold, his letter of introduction all rolled into one tidy, and terribly fragile, package. So when some ink-stained scoundrel in a third-floor print shop decides to drag that name through the public mud for the amusement of the five-cent readership, a man is left with a stark choice. He can stand by and let the filth dry on him, becoming a walking monument to another man’s lies, or he can take up a broom—or a cudgel, if need be—and do a bit of street-sweeping of his own. I chose the cudgel, and while the constable had a few choice words on the matter, my street is clean again.
