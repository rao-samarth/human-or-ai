There he goes now—see him? The gentleman tipping his hat to the ladies, with a prayer-book held so tenderly you’d think it was a sleeping babe. This whole town looks upon him as the very pinnacle of decency, a man whose shadow is cleaner than most folks’ Sunday clothes. They see the fine coat and the benevolent smile and they are quite satisfied they’ve seen the whole measure of the man. But I tell you, I sat in a cold room once and listened to a widow cry, a woman whose last dollar he had charmed away with that very same smile, leaving her and her children with nothing but the dust on the floorboards. It is a terrible and confounding thing, is it not?—how a man can be hollowed out by greed and rot, and yet his shell can be polished so bright that the whole world mistakes it for a solid gold statue and bows down to worship.
