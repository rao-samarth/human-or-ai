I saw a man the other day on a bustling corner, a regular apostle of real estate, selling parcels of land he called “The Eagle’s Perch.” He had a grand, colorful picture of it propped on an easel—all rolling hills and placid streams, with nary a mosquito in sight. A fellow next to me, a bricklayer by the looks of him, was so captivated he was practically counting out his savings right there on the cobblestones. The orator didn’t lie, not in the strictly legal sense; he just curated the facts with the skill of a master gardener weeding his prize petunias. He spoke of the “invigorating air,” but neglected to mention it was invigorated chiefly by the tannery a half-mile downwind. He praised the “abundant natural water features,” which was a poetical way of describing a swamp that had ambitions of becoming a proper lake someday. The whole truth was there, I suppose, but it was buried so deep under a heap of flowery language that you’d need a shovel and a strong constitution to ever dig it out.
