It is a peculiar thing to observe a man who believes his boots are standing on soil that is his by some holy right of inheritance, and to compare him to a fellow who only just purchased his acreage with a satchel of fresh banknotes. The first man moves with a kind of lazy certainty, as if the very grass and stones recognize his lineage and have no disposition to trip him; his authority is a quiet, settled thing, like an old oak that has no need to announce its presence. But the second man—well, he strides about with a perpetual loudness in his step, a nervous energy that seems to proclaim his deed and title to every passing cow and crow. He is the proprietor, you see, and feels a desperate and constant need for the landscape itself to ratify the transaction. One man possesses the land, while the other is merely possessed *by* it, and this trifling distinction, I reckon, is the very foundation upon which the whole human arrangement is built.
