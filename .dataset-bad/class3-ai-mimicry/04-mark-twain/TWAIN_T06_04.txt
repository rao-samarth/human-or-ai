I once observed aboard a sputtering steam-wheeler a perfectly respectable gentleman in a suit of decent wool, whose face soured over like milk left in the noon sun. His malady, it turned out, was not brought on by the churning of the river but by the sight of another passenger’s gleaming new brass spyglass; a triviality, to be sure, and an expensive one at that. His own spyglass, I noted, was entirely serviceable. And yet, the sight of this superior ornamentation—this minor triumph of another man’s pocketbook—afflicted him with a species of spiritual indigestion that soured his whole disposition. A man can be entirely content with his lot, believing it a blessing from Providence itself, right up until the moment he spies his neighbor’s slightly fatter calf or shinier boot buckle. In that instant, his own bounty curdles into the most bothersome of grievances.
