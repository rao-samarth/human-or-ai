The great and terrible silence that has now settled upon this house, a quiet more profound than a tomb at midnight, can trace its ancestry to a single, misplaced letter. I had only made a polite inquiry as to its whereabouts—a thing a man is entitled to do concerning his own correspondence—and from the fire that leapt into my wife’s eyes, you would have thought I’d accused her of high treason and conspiring with the cat. She took my simple question for a full-dress indictment, tried and convicted me right there by the hearth, with the only evidence being her own peculiar and inscrutable notions of injury. Now, she occupies one end of the parlor and I the other, two warring nations separated by a chasm of carpet, with no ambassador brave enough to cross. I reckon a man’s tongue is a perilous instrument, for it appears a harmless question, poorly aimed, can do more damage to domestic tranquility than a cannonball fired through the window.
