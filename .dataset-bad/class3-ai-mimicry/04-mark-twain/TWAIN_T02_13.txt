He sat there, slick as a newly-oiled hinge, spilling out his apologies like a preacher at a tent revival, and a body would have to be deaf, dumb, and mostly dead not to see the truth of it. The truth being, there wasn't any. It’s a curious business, the way a man can fashion a whole new self out of nothing more than good intentions and a forked tongue; he’ll wear that saintly mask so long and so proud that he clean forgets the scoundrel’s face he tucked away underneath. I watched his eyes, which darted about like a cornered raccoon looking for an escape route that didn't involve the hound, and I reckoned that the man he was pretending to be and the man he *was* were two fellows who, if they ever met on a dusty road, wouldn’t even tip their hats to one another. He was a stranger to himself, and a liar to me.
