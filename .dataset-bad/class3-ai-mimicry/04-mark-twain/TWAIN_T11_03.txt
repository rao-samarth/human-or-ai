You would not believe the grand pageant put on for this new operations manager, a Mr. Abernathy from the eastern office. He is a man constructed chiefly of starched collar and a profound certainty in his own opinions, which, so far as I can tell, are as common as sparrows but are treated here like birds of paradise. To see old Mr. Finch—a man who heretofore commanded this establishment like a sea captain on his own quarterdeck—now bobbing and fetching and agreeing with every pronouncement is a spectacle of such magnificent humiliation it ought to be put on a stage. Why, just yesterday Abernathy told a joke so feeble it would have gotten young Peterson in accounting fired for wasting company breath, yet the whole room erupted in a racket of manufactured glee that nearly shook the windows. It is a powerful lesson, I suppose, in the peculiar physics of the world: a man's wit, it seems, is weighed in direct proportion to the heft of his title and the shininess of his shoes.
