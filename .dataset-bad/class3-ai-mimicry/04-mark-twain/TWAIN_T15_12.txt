It is a peculiar affliction of the reasoning man that he can take a perfectly ordinary vexation and, through sheer force of will, elevate it into a personal declaration of war. My neighbor, Mr. Abernathy, who had retreated to these quiet hills for the sake of his nerves, has lately fallen victim to just such a grandeur of irritation. His foe is a woodpecker—a particularly industrious red-headed scoundrel who has taken a fancy to a dead oak tree. Abernathy has commenced to believe the bird's rhythmic hammering is not a search for grubs, but a targeted telegraph of insults meant only for his ears; he has taken to spending his afternoons behind his window curtains with a pair of opera glasses, scribbling in a little notebook what he calls "a logbook of the creature's infernal provocations." He now speaks of traps and countermeasures, and I have no doubt that he is, at this very moment, composing a formal ultimatum to be nailed to the trunk of that blameless tree.
