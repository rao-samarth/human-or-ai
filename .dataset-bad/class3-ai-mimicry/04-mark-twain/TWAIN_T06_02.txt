There is a peculiar brand of silent piety that only truly flourishes at a family get-together, especially when one cousin has had the supreme impertinence to succeed. I watched it spread across the parlor like a slow fever. Cousin Bartholomew, puffed up with the pride of a new business venture, held court near the fireplace, and the relations circled him with smiles so stiff you could have cracked a walnut on them. Every laudatory remark was a carefully whittled dart, dipped in sugar. I saw Aunt Martha’s eyes, fixed not on Bartholomew’s beaming face but on the fine silk of his waistcoat, performing a furious arithmetic of her own son’s diminished prospects. It is a most grievous affliction, this thing; a species of moral colic that begins the moment a man suspects his neighbor’s hog is fatter than his own. The whole affair is a grand palaver of congratulations, but underneath it all runs a bitter stream of calculation—a desperate accounting of why fortune smiled on the wrong man’s house.
