There is a particular brand of wakefulness that visits a man after midnight, when the good fortune of another fellow—a man of no particular merit, mind you—settles in your gut like a lump of cold lead. You lie there and turn the matter over, examining it from all sides as if it were some curious beetle, and you convince yourself that it is not the man’s new carriage you begrudge him, but the fraudulent smile with which he procured it. You can picture that smile plainly. For an honest man’s prosperity is a thing to be celebrated, but a scoundrel’s success is a personal affront to the whole moral order of the universe; or at least, to your own quiet corner of it. It is a most vexing and righteous sort of indigestion, a spiritual malady that sours a man’s disposition worse than bad whiskey, and for which there is no known patent medicine.
