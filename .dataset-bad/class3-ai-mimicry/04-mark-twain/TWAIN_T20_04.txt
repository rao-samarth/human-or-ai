Deacon Miller had a particular genius for instructing the rest of us on the virtues of a calm temperament, claiming a man’s soul was a tidy ship that must be steered clear of the squalls of passion. A man ought to meet any crisis, he’d say, with prayerful stillness. And then his prize-winning sow—a four-hundred-pound cannonball of pink indignation—discovered a flaw in the fence-latch and commenced a tour of the county. What followed was a spectacle of passion that would’ve made a heathen blush. The Deacon took off like a shot, his good coat flapping like a crow’s broken wing, hollering threats and damnations that had nothing to do with prayer and everything to do with pork. He tore through Mrs. Miller’s pristine petunias, vaulted a creek with a most unholy squawk, and ended up wrestling the beast in a mud-wallow, both of them squealing to wake the dead. It seemed the Deacon’s tidy ship was best steered from a dry pulpit, and foundered pretty quick in actual weather.
