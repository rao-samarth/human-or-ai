Try not just listing facts in simple sentences like paragraphs one-two-three-four-five etc.. - Introduce some ambiguity without too much detail (like detective stories do). - Don't go into extreme suspense right away! First introduce small hints bit by bit slowly building up tension so they have interest throughout reading experience rather than suddenly revealing big twist at end which leaves reader feeling unsatisfied because plot points were unresolved earlier on. Constraints: - Use correct spelling, grammar, punctuation. Avoid abbreviations such as u for "you," lol for laughter unless clearly established first within context e.g.: As he entered his room there was sitting upon an armchair beside his own man whom we both knew well - old Sholto himself who had changed little either since then nor after that terrible death upstairs when we found him slumped over a desk covered with papers stained red with blood...
