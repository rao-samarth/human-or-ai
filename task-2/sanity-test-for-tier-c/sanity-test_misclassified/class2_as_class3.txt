My Dearest Elspeth,

You would not recognize our quiet hollow now. The old ways are crumbling like the dry-stone walls on the upper fields. Lord Ashworth’s manor stands silent, its gates no longer guarded. Yesterday, I saw Thomas, the blacksmith’s youngest, leading a group of men into the lord’s own woods with axes, and no one so much as challenged them. They say the wood is for everyone now. The vicar tried to speak of duty and station from his pulpit on Sunday, but half the pews were empty, and those who remained just muttered amongst themselves. Father says it is a fever that has taken hold, but I see the look in the villagers' eyes. It is not a sickness, Elspeth. It is a hunger for something new, a reckoning for what was long denied them. I find myself watching the road, unsure if I am more afraid of what is coming or what is being left behind.
