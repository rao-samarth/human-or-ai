One sat in the little café opposite the station, and one observed. It was a most curious business, this peace. The young women at the next table—girls who had, I daresay, handled munitions or driven ambulances with a steady nerve—chattered now only of dress lengths and the quality of this year’s jam. We had all been someone of consequence, you see; we had purpose. I recall quite vividly the heft of the wheel in my hands, navigating a supply lorry through the blackout—a definite, important thing to be doing. Now, what was one to do? Mother insisted a suitable marriage was the only proper course. But the woman who had tasted such freedom found the prospect of arranging flowers profoundly dull. It was a genuine puzzle: how to reconcile the person you had become with the person you were now expected to be. A rather tiresome predicament, and no mistake.
