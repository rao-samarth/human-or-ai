I recall it with a peculiar clarity, the autumn of '41, when the change at the firm became irreversible. Hitherto, a certain decorum had prevailed; Mr. Finch, our head clerk for thirty years, was a bastion of methodical, if rather slow, procedure. But with the younger men gone, it was Miss Pearson—a girl of no more than twenty, with startlingly direct eyes—who was given the quarterly accounts. I remember seeing her at Mr. Finch's own desk, her pen moving with a briskness that seemed almost unseemly. He stood watching her, his face a perplexing mixture of indignation and helplessness. She did not even look up. It was not a rebellion, you understand; it was something far more potent. It was the quiet, matter-of-fact assumption of a place that had never, not once, been intended for her.
