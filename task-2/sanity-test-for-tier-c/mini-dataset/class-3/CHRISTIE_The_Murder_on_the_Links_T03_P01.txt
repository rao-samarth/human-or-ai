Mr Abernathy stared at the row of morocco-bound ledgers, the so-called concrete facts of the matter concerning poor Mr Croft. The Yard men had pored over them, naturally; they had seen the ink, the precise columns of figures, and concluded it was all merely a case of unfortunate incompetence. A sad affair, they said, and closed the file. But they had not seen what he had seen; they had not observed the slight, almost imperceptible tremor in Sir Julian’s hand as he signed the accusation, nor the flicker of cruel triumph—so swiftly suppressed—in his eyes. The ledgers, you see, told a story of numbers, but they were quite silent on the matter of a man’s soul. They could not show the years of quiet, festering jealousy that had finally bloomed. One could prove a sum was incorrect; one could not, alas, prove a heart was wicked.
