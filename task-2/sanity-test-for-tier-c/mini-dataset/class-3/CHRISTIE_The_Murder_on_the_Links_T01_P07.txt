Aunt Mildred’s formidable countenance had set like blancmange left out in a draught. Her niece, the altogether too-modern Clara, had just announced—with a cheerfulness that was in itself quite suspect—her intention of taking a flat. Alone. In London. A young woman of good breeding and, one assumed, some sense. “It is not merely a question of propriety, my dear girl,” Mildred pronounced, her voice acquiring the tone of a judge sentencing a particularly vexing criminal, “it is a matter of what is, and what is not, *done*.” Clara, however, merely inspected her fingernails with a detached air. “But it *is* being done, Auntie. By me, in fact. Next Tuesday.” The silence that followed was profound, broken only by my Uncle Henry’s discreet cough from behind his newspaper. It was a most peculiar standoff; a clash not of wills, but of centuries, played out over the sherry glasses and the last of the seed cake.
