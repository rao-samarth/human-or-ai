I often think back to that grey afternoon in London, the sort that chills one to the bone. We were in a terribly crowded tea-room—the air thick with steam and chatter—and I paid no mind to the two gentlemen at the adjacent table. Their conversation was a dull murmur about finances, or so I assumed, until the younger man made his fatal slip. “It is precisely as Mr. Nightingale planned,” he said, a trifle too loudly. A silence fell between them, a sudden, chilling void. The older man, who had a nervous habit of polishing his spectacles, went utterly still. His hand froze, his face a mask of cold fury. In that moment, a perfectly ordinary afternoon was transformed. I had unknowingly heard the key turn in a lock, and on the other side of that door was not a safe-room, but a world of quite appalling peril.
