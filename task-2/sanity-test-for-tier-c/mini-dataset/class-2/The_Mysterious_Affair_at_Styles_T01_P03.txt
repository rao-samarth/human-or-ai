From my hotel window, the city lights below look like scattered jewels, which feels ironic. I keep thinking about what happened after the reading of the will. Remember how we all used to cram into Grandma’s kitchen, fighting over the last biscuit? Now we only communicate through solicitors, our affection replaced by a cold calculus of percentages. That antique clock we used to wind together is no longer a shared memory; it’s an asset, a point of bitter contention between you and David. The inheritance wasn’t a foundation for our futures, as Father had hoped. It was a solvent that dissolved the bonds we once thought were unbreakable. It seems the final price of his fortune was our family itself, and watching these strangers laugh in the streets below, I feel utterly bankrupt. I hope you are well, despite it all.
