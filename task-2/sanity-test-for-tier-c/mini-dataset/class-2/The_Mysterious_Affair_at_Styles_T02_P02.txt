From the sidewalk, the imposing silhouette of Mr. Henderson’s home seemed to radiate stability against the dark sky. Inside, a single lamp cast a warm, inviting glow across a living room arranged with pristine precision. To the world, he was a pillar of quiet dignity, a man whose crisp suits and polite nods were as reliable as the sunrise. But through the parted curtains, a different truth was visible. He wasn't reading a leather-bound book or sipping brandy as one might imagine. Instead, he was on his knees, meticulously arranging his collection of miniature glass animals into aggressive, warring factions. His face, usually a mask of calm composure, was twisted in a childish, silent snarl of concentration. The man the neighborhood saw was an immaculate facade; the man inside, alone in the lamplight, was governed by strange and secret compulsions, playing out tiny battles in his perfect, silent house.
