“…and that’s the third time this month the entire network has gone down for ‘unscheduled maintenance’,” Sarah muttered, jabbing the elevator button again. Leo shifted his weight, glancing down the empty hallway. “It’s just old servers, Sarah. You know how cheap this place is.”

“Is it? Because I overheard Henderson on the phone this morning. He was talking to someone about ‘degaussing the Nightingale asset’.” She looked at him, eyebrows raised. “That doesn’t sound like server maintenance to me.”

Leo’s casual demeanor vanished. His voice dropped to a near whisper. “Where did you hear that?”

“Just walking past his office,” she replied, a knot of unease tightening in her stomach.

“Listen to me,” he said, his hand gripping her arm with surprising force. “You did not hear anything. You do not know what a Nightingale is, and you will forget that name. Some doors, once you open them, you can never close.” The elevator doors slid open with a soft chime, but neither of them moved.
