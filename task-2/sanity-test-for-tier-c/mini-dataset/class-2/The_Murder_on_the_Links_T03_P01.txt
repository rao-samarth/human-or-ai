My brother, Daniel, held up the Ziploc bag containing the porcelain shard. "Liam's fingerprint is on it, clear as day. Case closed." He presented it to the family table like a prosecutor resting his case after discovering who broke grandmother's antique music box. Everyone looked at my young cousin, who was shrinking into his chair, close to tears. But I had been watching Uncle Robert all evening. I saw how his jaw tightened every time the heirloom was mentioned, the slight, almost imperceptible shake in his hand as he reached for his wine. He hadn't said a word, staring at his plate with a manufactured intensity. The fingerprint was a fact, a solid piece of data, but it was a single, misleading note in a quiet symphony of guilt that played across our uncle's face. Daniel saw a clue on a piece of shattered ceramic; I saw a confession in a guilty man’s eyes.
