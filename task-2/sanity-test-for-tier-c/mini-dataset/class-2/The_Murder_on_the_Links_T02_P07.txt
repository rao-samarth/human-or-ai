Most people saw Mr. Henderson as a permanent, dusty fixture of the accounts department, a man of beige cardigans and quiet, methodical keystrokes. His desk was an island of analogue order in a sea of digital efficiency, topped with a Rolodex and a single, wilting fern. Colleagues spoke to him with a kind of gentle condescension, assuming the slowness of his movements reflected the speed of his mind. One Tuesday, however, I passed his cubicle after hours and heard him on the phone. His voice was firm, fluid, and sharp as he navigated a complex international trade dispute in fluent Mandarin, citing specific clauses of maritime law with startling authority. He gestured with his free hand, sketching out a solution on a notepad with an architect’s precision. In that moment, the mild-mannered accountant vanished, replaced by a formidable strategist hidden in plain sight.
