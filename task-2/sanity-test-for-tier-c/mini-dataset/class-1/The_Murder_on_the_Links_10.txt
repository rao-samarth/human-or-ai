"Now, to support this theory, the criminal must have been
fully cognizant of Mr. Renauld's plans. That leads us to Madame
Renauld. But facts fail to support any theory of her guilt. Is
there any one else who might have known of them? Yes. From Marthe
Daubreuil's own lips we have the admission that she overheard
M. Renauld's quarrel with the tramp. If she could overhear that,
there is no reason why she should not have heard everything else,
especially if M. and Madame Renauld were imprudent enough to discuss
their plans sitting on the bench. Remember how easily you overheard
Marthe's conversation with Jack Renauld from that spot."
