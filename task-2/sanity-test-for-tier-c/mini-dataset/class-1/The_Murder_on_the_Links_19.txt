I began to see daylight. If that were indeed the case, it might
furnish Jack with the alibi he needed. Yet under those circumstances
his silence seemed difficult to explain.  Why could he not have
spoken out boldly? Did he fear for this former entanglement of his to
come to the ears of Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied.
The thing had been harmless enough, a foolish boy and girl affair,
and I reflected cynically that the son of a millionaire was not
likely to be thrown over by a penniless French girl, who moreover
loved him devotedly, without a much graver cause.
