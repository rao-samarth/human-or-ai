"After that we shouted at each other in sheer rage, until I suddenly
realized that I was in danger of missing my train to Paris. I had
to run for the station, still in a white heat of fury. However,
once well away, I calmed down. I wrote to Marthe, telling her what
had happened, and her reply soothed me still further. She pointed
out to me that we had only to be steadfast, and any opposition
was bound to give way at last. Our affection for each other must
be tried and proved, and when my parents realized that it was no
light infatuation on my part they would doubtless relent towards
us. Of course, to her, I had not dwelt on my father's principal
objection to the match. I soon saw that I should do my cause no
good by violence. My father wrote me several letters to Paris,
affectionate in tone, and which did not refer to our disagreement
or its cause, and I replied in the same strain."
