And then, towards the close of the trial, a letter, posted in Paris,
was sent to the Public Prosecutor. It was from Georges Conneau and,
without revealing his whereabouts, it contained a full confession
of the crime.  He declared that he had indeed struck the fatal blow
at Madame Beroldy's instigation. The crime had been planned between
them. Believing that her husband ill-treated her, and maddened by
his own passion for her, a passion which he believed her to return,
he had planned the crime and struck the fatal blow that should free
the woman he loved from a hateful bondage. Now, for the first time,
he learnt of Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, and realized that the woman he loved
had betrayed him! Not for his sake did she wish to be free--but in
order to marry the wealthy American. She had used him as a cat's-paw,
and now, in his jealous rage, he turned and denounced her, declaring
that throughout he had acted at her instigation.
