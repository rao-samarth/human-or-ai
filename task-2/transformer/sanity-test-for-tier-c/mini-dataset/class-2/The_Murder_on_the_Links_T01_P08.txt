“I saw Elara Henderson again this morning, down at the hardware store,” Beatrice said, stirring her coffee so vigorously it threatened to slop over the diner mug’s rim. “Hauling planks of wood into that ridiculous truck of hers. All by herself.” Agnes took a slow sip of her tea. “Her mother must be mortified. A pretty girl like that, living alone in the old Miller place, getting her hands dirty. It’s not respectable.” “Respectable?” Agnes scoffed gently. “The girl bought that house with her own money, Bea. She doesn't need a man to feel settled. It's not 1950.” Beatrice set her spoon down with a clatter. “Some things are about decency, not the date on a calendar. A young woman needs a family, a protector. What she’s doing is just… adrift. It sets a strange example for the other girls.” Agnes just looked out the window, a small smile playing on her lips. “Maybe it’s a good example.”
