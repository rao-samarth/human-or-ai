Elias slammed the rusty gate shut, the clang echoing across the barren fields. "You can't just leave," he said, his voice rough. "This farm is all we have left. Father’s legacy is in this soil." Lena stood her ground by the old stone wall, her city coat a stark contrast to the muted greens and browns of the countryside. "Father’s legacy died with him on some forgotten front," she retorted, her tone cutting. "I spent the war assembling engines, Elias. I learned how to build things that move, that go somewhere. I will not spend the rest of my life watching things grow only to be cut down again, season after season." He took a step towards her, his face a mask of disbelief and anger. "That’s talk for men in parlors, not for a farmer's daughter. Your role is here." She just shook her head, a cold resolve in her eyes. "No. My role is the one I make for myself now."
