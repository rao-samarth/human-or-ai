I sat on my usual bench in the park, observing a little spat between two young people, and my mind drifted, as it so often does, back to Geneva. I remembered young Annelise, a girl of no more than twenty. We all knew the danger, of course; one did not handle such papers lightly in those days. When the moment came, when everyone else looked at their shoes or suddenly found the ceiling most fascinating, she simply held out her hand. Her face was quite pale, but her chin was firm. “It is the only thing to be done,” she had whispered, not to me, but to the air itself. It is a peculiar thing, human nature. Most will do anything to preserve their own small comforts. But for a few—the rare and brave ones—there is a point where personal safety becomes an irrelevance, a triviality against the stark necessity of a righteous act. I never knew what became of her, but I have never forgotten that look of absolute, terrifying conviction.
