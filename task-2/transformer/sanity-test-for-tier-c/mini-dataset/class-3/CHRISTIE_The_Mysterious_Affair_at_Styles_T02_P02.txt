One learns, on these Continental expresses, to mistrust a first impression. Opposite me sat a rather florid gentleman, whose checked suit was of a pattern most offensive to the eye; his companion, a demure lady in quiet grey, possessed the sort of sorrowful countenance that invites immediate sympathy. One naturally constructed a little drama: the boor and the martyr. Then, with a sudden lurch of the carriage, the lady’s teacup overturned directly onto the gentleman’s appalling trousers. For a fleeting instant, her face contorted into something venomous, a mask of pure spite—but the man merely chuckled. “No harm done, my dear, no harm at all!” he boomed, dabbing at the stain with a large, clean handkerchief. “We shall call it a misadventure.” In that simple, kindly trifle, the truth was laid bare. He, for all his vulgarity, possessed a gentle soul; she, for all her refinement, was thoroughly unkind. It is invariably the way of things.
