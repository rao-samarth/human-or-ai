The family sat in a strained semi-circle about the dying fire, a tableau of feigned civility. The subject of their late uncle’s will had not been broached; indeed, it need not be, for it was present in every glance and every carefully measured silence. Julian stared at his brandy, his gaze flicking periodically towards a hideous porcelain shepherdess on the mantelpiece—an item he had always professed to detest, but which he was now, one suspected, mentally appraising. His sister, Eleanor, watched him; her expression was one of dutiful sorrow, yet her knuckles were quite white where she gripped the arm of her chair. When she spoke of the need to uphold their uncle’s “final wishes,” the words were delivered with a peculiar, clipped emphasis. It was a poison, this business of inheritance; a slow-acting acid that dissolved affection, leaving only the hard, unlovely metal of pecuniary interest.
