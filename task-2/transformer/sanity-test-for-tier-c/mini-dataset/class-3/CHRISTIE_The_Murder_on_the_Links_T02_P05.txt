The hotel lounge was a quiet affair that afternoon, a place of hushed tones and the discreet clinking of teacups. My attention was drawn to a particular couple seated by the window; they were the very picture of married contentment. He, a man of some means—one could tell by the precise cut of his suit—and she, quite lovely, with a string of pearls that were undoubtedly real. They spoke in low, pleasant tones, a perfect domestic scene for public consumption. Yet, one learns to look for the small things, the little discords that betray the harmony. His smile, for instance, never truly reached his eyes; it was a mask put on for the occasion. Her laughter, when it came, was a fraction too high, a little brittle around the edges. But it was her hands, you see, that gave the whole game away. While one gestured gracefully, her left, resting upon the damask tablecloth, was clenched into a tight, white-knuckled fist. To the casual glance, a portrait of success; to the trained eye, a carefully constructed performance, and the strain was becoming, indeed, quite apparent.
