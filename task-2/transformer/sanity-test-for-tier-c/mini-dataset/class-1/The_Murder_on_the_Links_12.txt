"And then," said Poirot gravely, "the justice that he has so
long eluded overtakes him. An unknown hand stabs him in the
back. . . . Now, Hastings, you understand what I mean when I talk
of _two_ crimes. The first crime, the crime that M. Renauld, in
his arrogance, asked us to investigate (ah, but he made a famous
mistake there! He misjudged Hercule Poirot!) is solved.  But behind
it lies a deeper riddle. And to solve that will be difficult--since
the criminal in his wisdom, has been content to avail himself of
the devices prepared by M.  Renauld. It has been a particularly
perplexing and baffling mystery to solve. A young hand, like Giraud,
who does not place any reliance on the psychology, is almost certain
to fail."
