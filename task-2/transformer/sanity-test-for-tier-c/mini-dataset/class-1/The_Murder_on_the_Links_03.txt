"Georges Conneau flies from justice--to Canada.  There, under
an assumed name he marries, and finally acquires a vast fortune
in South America. But there is a nostalgia upon him for his own
country. Twenty years have elapsed, he is considerably changed
in appearance, besides being a man of such eminence that no one
is likely to connect him with a fugitive from justice many years
ago. He deems it quite safe to return. He takes up his headquarters
in England, but intends to spend the summers in France. And ill
fortune, that obscure justice which shapes men's ends, and will
not allow them to evade the consequences of their acts, takes him
to Merlinville. There, in the whole of France, is the one person
who is capable of recognizing him. It is, of course, a gold mine
to Madame Daubreuil, and a gold mine of which she is not slow to
take advantage. He is helpless, absolutely in her power. And she
bleeds him heavily.
