"Our work here is finished. Perhaps, M. Renauld, you will listen
whilst your evidence is read over to you. I have purposely kept
all the proceedings as informal as possible. I have been called
original in my methods, but I maintain that there is much to be
said for originality.  The case is now in the clever hands of the
renowned M. Giraud. He will without doubt distinguish himself.
Indeed, I wonder that he has not already laid his hands upon
the murderers! Madame, again let me assure you of my heart-felt
sympathy. Messieurs, I wish you all good day." And, accompanied by
his clerk and the commissary, he took his departure.
