you know, there ' s this kinda cozy feeling you get used to in this whole neighborhood thing, it was, like, i don't know, the safe feeling of this little place we call home, a cozy kind of sameness, you know? and i really did think i did, like, i thought i knew the guy living in the yellow house across the street and i mean, he was the sort of guy who returned borrowed stuff early and bought those girl scout cookies by the case, like almost too nice in his decency, you know what i mean? but then it all fell apart when i accidentally opened his mail, a simple mix - up by the postman, you know, whatever and the letter wasn ' t a power bill or a birthday card, i mean, not even close man like, no way, no, no way, this thing was some kind of like redacted government file with a photo of him looking twenty years younger and scarily cold and it totally gave me the creeps so i was just standing right there on my own porch and this envelope felt like it weighed a ton of bricks and it just hit me that that whole nice guy act wasn ' t really just a personality thing at all like you know it was a cover - up, just perfect and impenetrable, hiding some crazy other life that had no business existing between the library and the bakery i mean come on going on here in a place like this things like that don't happen
