As this weary road doth carry me from that sad town, my soul is much disquieted by what I there did witness. For in that place, two houses of a noble stock have, by their long and canker’d enmity, made a desert of their own inheritance, feeding their malice until it hath consumed all goodness. What pride, what devilish and unnatural spleen, could so possess a man that he would see his own blood spilt upon the stones rather than yield an inch of ground? Methinks the very air is sick with the ghost of their choler, and the dust itself is made of nought but the crumbled monuments to their endless strife. Their children now learn to curse ere they can pray, and the patrimony they shall one day claim is but a heap of ash and sorrow, a foul inheritance bought with the coin of their fathers’ venom.

Lord Bramwell sat in judgment, his brow a furrowed field of vexation, whilst before him stood the cause: a trembling page who had, with damnable audacity, purloined the final marzipan swan. The law, as barked by the puffed-chested steward, demanded a public whipping for such an affront to the evening's dignity, a stern and righteous balancing of the scales. Yet Her Ladyship, whose heart was ever a softer substance than her husband's head, did plead for clemency, arguing that the boy's stomach, and not his soul, was the true villain of the piece. To punish a rumbling belly as one would a traitorous heart seemed a disproportionate cruelty, she declared, for what is a confection against the tears of a child? The whole hall waited upon his word: would the rod of discipline fall, to satisfy the ordinance and the cook’s fury, or would a gentle pardon prevail, and in so doing, make a mockery of the very order of the feast?

Mark how the senior clerk, with spectacles perched upon his solemn nose, doth pore upon his ledger as if it were a holy text. The guild master praises his unceasing diligence, whilst lesser men whisper of his piety, noting how his thin lips move in silent prayer even as his quill records their profits and their losses. They see an anchor of a man, a fixed and honest point in a turning world of trade. Yet were their sight so keen to pierce the veil of custom and regard, they would spy the truth that festers in the ink: that with each careful stroke he shaves a phantom sliver for himself, his quiet prayers not to any god in heaven but to the growing idol of his secret coffers. His sober coat is but the costume for his greed, and the stage whereon he plays the part of loyal servant is built with planks of pure deceit.

Honestly, Cyril," she whispered, her voice possessing a distinct wobble that caused the man at the adjacent table to lower his newspaper with a rustle of profound interest, "I'm not entirely certain I was built for this level of sustained astonishment. When one pictures a shared future, one imagines a gentle rhythm, a certain placid progression of days. One does not, as a rule, budget for one's larder being commandeered by a distant cousin for an ill-advised mushroom-canning enterprise, nor for the vicar to ring up at all hours to complain that our dog has taught his prize-winning parrot a series of unspeakable sea shanties. It all seems to be a relentless sequence of small, bewildering catastrophes, Cyril, and I must confess, with the postman now refusing to approach the house on account of what he calls ‘the incident with the ferret,’ my nerve is beginning to fray. Is this it? Is this simply what it is to be us?

I grant you, my darling, things have been a bit on the rummy side since we returned," I ventured, patting her hand in what I hoped was a soothing manner. "One doesn't expect one's new cook to abscond after a minor tiff with the toaster, nor for the plumbers to accidentally re-route the bathwater into the linen cupboard. It puts a bit of a strain on the marital home, I'll concede. But look here, isn't this precisely the sort of thing that forges a partnership? It's not a first-class shambles; it’s a shakedown cruise! We're finding our sea legs, what? Every soggy towel and temperamental appliance is just another rogue wave we're weathering together. Before you know it, we'll be sailing in calm waters, laughing at the memory of it all. Chin up, old love; we're in the soup, certainly, but we’re in it together.

A man watches the endless parade of carriages rattle down the cobblestones, and he can’t help but notice the peculiar anatomy of importance in a great city. You’ll see a fellow, whose chief accomplishment in life was to be born, lean out his window with an air of profound ownership, as if he’d laid every stone himself and personally trained the pigeons not to despoil his hat. The world makes way for him, not because he is wise or decent, but because his father was. It’s a kind of inherited gravity. But then you might see a simple candlemaker settle a vicious argument between two cart drivers with such plain, unvarnished fairness that the whole street corner goes quiet to listen. That humble man, with wax under his fingernails, commands a respect the other fellow has to purchase with his name, and I know which currency holds its value when the accounts are truly settled.

Must we proceed with such a foul disguise, my lord?” the younger man whispered, his face pale in the lone candlelight. “To praise him to his teeth, to bow and fawn when all my soul cries out for his swift ruin; it doth make a villain of me.” The elder statesman turned, his weary eyes holding no comfort. “And what art thou, a simpleton? Wouldst thou throw plain truth against a fortress wall and hope it crumbles? Nay, a lie well-told is but a sharper blade than any honest steel when wielded for a righteous cause. We speak with sweetened words to mask the bitter draught we brew for him; we fashion this false amity to be the very ground from which his downfall springs. Let not thy squeamish heart betray our purpose, for in this wretched court, a virtuous tongue is but a quick path to a silent grave. Clothe thyself in falsehood; ‘tis the only armour that shall keep our noble end alive.

Hark, my dear son, and look you upon this gathering, a kingdom built not with the sword but with good cheer. Many a man I have seen in my time, with eyes that burned for a higher seat, who thought to climb upon the backs of their fellows to grasp a barren sceptre. Yet what becomes of their hollow conquests? Their names fade like breath on a winter's morn. But see here the legacy that endures: the laughter of children, the loyalty of kin, the quiet peace of a house filled with love. Let this be the summit of your striving. For true wealth is not counted in coin nor measured in leagues of land, but is found in the steadfast hearts that surround you. A man whose greatest ambition is the happiness of his own hearth shall never know the poverty of a lonely throne.

As the carriage rattled over the moorland road, I observed a most dreadful transformation in my companion, a man whom I had hitherto known as a creature of pure, dispassionate reason. His hands, which could trace the most delicate of chemical experiments, were clenched now into white-knuckled fists, and his gaze was fixed upon the grey, passing landscape with an intensity that was altogether chilling. He had spoken but once in the last hour, to name the blackguard who had brought such ruin upon the woman to whom his entire soul was devoted, and in the utterance of that name, I saw his purpose harden. A profound and noble love had, by some terrible alchemy of injustice, been transmuted into an equally profound and single-minded lust for retribution. It was a fearful thing to witness, for I knew that the man he hunted deserved the very worst that the law might devise, yet I could not quiet the question in my own heart as to whether I was now accomplice to a righteous judgment, or merely to a savage and private war.

You thought the matter concluded, did you not? That the miserable business in the colonies was a ghost to be laid to rest by two decades of respectable living? My dear sir, you cannot build a new life upon the foundations of an old crime; the structure is doomed from its very inception! Every sovereign you have earned, every ounce of prestige you have acquired, has been but a deferment against the inevitable calling-in of a debt. The past is not some ledger that can be conveniently balanced or burned; it is a living thing, a bloodhound that, once it has the scent, will never abandon the trail. It has followed you across oceans and through the years, and I must inform you now, with the utmost gravity, that its baying is at last upon your very doorstep! You are a man cornered by his own history, and there is no escape.

Mark you, my lord, the most perilous road to Hell is oft paved, not with sin, but with the purest dreams of Heaven. For when a man conceives a perfect world, a commonwealth of such flawless reason that it shames our own poor, stumbling state, he looks upon his fellow men not as brothers, but as misshapen clay to be remade in his image. He sees their vices, their petty loyalties, their very freedoms, as cankers upon the body politic that must be excised. And what surgeon's tool doth he employ for such a task? Why, 'tis the sword, the fire, the headsman's block. He who would build a new Jerusalem upon the earth must first clear the ground, and in his righteous haste, he mistakes the cries of men for the groaning of old timbers. So his utopia is founded not on virtue, but on graves, and the glorious dawn he promised brings only the shadow of the gallows.

It’s a rummy business, this whole London scene, when you stop to think about it. As I watched the human tide surge past the club window, I spotted old Boffington, a man so rich he probably used ten-pound notes for kindling, steering along a chit of a girl who wore the sort of frozen smile you see on a fish at the market. A pure business transaction, if ever I saw one. And yet, not ten feet behind them, a young fellow in a rather shabby coat was gazing at a girl with a hat that had clearly seen better days, and the two of them were beaming at one another as if they’d just been handed the keys to the city. It gave a chap pause for thought. I mean, one can get frightfully keen on the old filthy lucre, and nobody enjoys an empty trouser-pocket, but when you weigh it all up, I’m not so sure I wouldn’t trade a hefty dividend for a slice of that sort of goofy, star-struck nonsense. Dashed if I wouldn’t.
